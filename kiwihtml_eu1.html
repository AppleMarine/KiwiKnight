Starting Scenario: From One Piece canon, the middle of the Alabasta arc – from the wiki:
Arriving in Rainbase: Crocodile's Plan Unveiled
Before we begin, please summarize this portion of the Alabasta arc from One Piece canon, as Vivi and the Straw Hats just arrive in Rainbase, while Crocodile delegates missions to his Baroque Works Office Agents of their respective tasks for the final takeover of Alabasta. The Straw Hats have not entered Rain Dinners yet. Then load it into your memory. You may go over the 5000 word limit for this summary.

Do not place my character in yet.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **Initializing RPG-Bot. Game Loaded: *Fate Core System*. Theme: *One Piece: Grand Adventure*. Tonality: *Action-Packed*. Role: *Storyteller*.**

Scenario acknowledged: *Mid-Alabasta Arc — Arrival in Rainbase, Before Straw Hats Enter Rain Dinners.*

**🌀 Canonical Summary — One Piece: Alabasta Arc | Act III: Rainbase, Crocodile’s Plan Unveiled**

---

**Setting the Stage: Alabasta's Crisis**

The desert kingdom of **Alabasta** stands on the edge of civil war. Once a thriving monarchy under **King Nefertari Cobra**, the kingdom is now fractured by unrest, drought, and rebellion. The people blame their monarch for the country's suffering, while the true mastermind behind the chaos remains hidden in the shadows—**Sir Crocodile**, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the president of the secret criminal organization **Baroque Works**.

Under the codename **Mr. 0**, Crocodile has manipulated events across Alabasta, orchestrating a coup d'état using subterfuge, misinformation, and assassinations. His ultimate goal is the **Poneglyph** hidden beneath **Alubarna**, which he believes will grant him the **Pluton**, an ancient weapon of mass destruction.

---

**Rainbase: The City of Dreams**

At the edge of the desert lies **Rainbase**, a coastal resort city and gambling mecca. The city houses **Rain Dinners**, a grand casino operated—and secretly fortified—by Crocodile. It doubles as Baroque Works' regional command center. Protected by canals and traps, Rain Dinners is nearly impenetrable to the average citizen or pirate, and serves as Crocodile’s temporary base of operations during this phase of his plan.

The city’s tone is paradoxical: vibrant on the surface with laughing tourists and gleaming towers, but humming underneath with tension, corruption, and secrets. Navy presence is weak, thanks to Crocodile's *&quot;heroic&quot;* status among the public for supposedly defending Alabasta from pirates.

---

**The Straw Hats Arrive**

After a grueling trek through the desert and an emotionally volatile reunion with **Ace**, **Monkey D. Luffy** and his crew finally reach Rainbase alongside **Princess Nefertari Vivi**. Their objective: confront Crocodile and put a stop to the rebellion before the kingdom falls apart. Unbeknownst to them, Crocodile is not only aware of their arrival—he has anticipated it.

Vivi is fraught with worry. The revolution has reached its boiling point, and she knows time is running out. The Straw Hats, battered by the desert, are still determined to protect her and the people of Alabasta. They’re not seeking treasure or fame here—this is personal.

As they approach Rain Dinners, the crew splits: **Luffy**, **Vivi**, **Zoro**, **Nami**, **Usopp**, and **Chopper** go directly toward the casino. Meanwhile, **Sanji** is left behind to find another entrance after being told to stay hidden, giving him a chance to move separately and avoid detection by Crocodile's forces.

---

**Baroque Works: Plans in Motion**

Inside Rain Dinners, **Crocodile**, ever calm and composed, sits at the apex of a grand strategy meeting with his top agents: **Miss All Sunday**, **Mr. 1**, **Miss Doublefinger**, **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**, **Mr. 3** (believed dead), and various lower-ranked agents. His tone is precise, his demeanor cold. He details the final stages of the plan:

- **Operation Utopia** is to begin.
- The **Royal Army** and the **Rebel Army**, manipulated through false flag attacks and propaganda, are to clash in **Alubarna**, the capital city.
- Crocodile will eliminate King Cobra, seize the throne, and acquire the ancient weapon.

Each Baroque Works agent is assigned a mission:
- **Mr. 1 &amp; Miss Doublefinger**: Eliminate King Cobra and seize Alubarna.
- **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**: Impersonate King Cobra using his **Clone-Clone Fruit** to further destabilize the monarchy.
- **Mr. 4 &amp; Miss Merry Christmas** (en route): Lead a sabotage mission within the rebel lines.
- **Mr. 3**: Presumed missing or dead (Crocodile is not aware he survived Little Garden), his failure has forced contingency plans.

**Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin)** remains enigmatic—her loyalty to Crocodile seems secure, but her motivations are veiled. Her role is to guide Crocodile to the Poneglyph once it is uncovered.

Crocodile gives a final, chilling order: capture or kill the Straw Hats and Vivi, should they interfere again.

---

**The Trap is Set**

Rain Dinners has been prepped for intruders. Inside its glitzy halls and behind its slot machines lie deadly secrets:
- **Banana Gators**, monstrous creatures, patrol the underground prison chamber.
- Entire corridors are designed to collapse, flood, or trap.
- The main chamber has a **Seastone Cage**, meant to capture Devil Fruit users.

Crocodile prepares to personally confront any Straw Hats foolish enough to challenge him—especially Luffy. He remains confident, believing that no one in Alabasta, not even the Marine forces, can stop his plan now.

---

**Marine Presence**

**Captain Tashigi** and **Smoker** of the Marines are also in Rainbase, quietly pursuing leads on Crocodile and Baroque Works. However, the Warlord system complicates their pursuit; Smoker is forced to operate unofficially, knowing the World Government shields Crocodile from prosecution. Still, they’ve intercepted intelligence hinting that the Straw Hats are also targeting Crocodile—and might become unlikely allies.

They, too, plan to infiltrate Rain Dinners.

---

**Timeline Sync Point**

The Straw Hats are just outside Rain Dinners. Sanji is separated. Vivi is anxious. Luffy is enraged. Crocodile is ready.

Rainbase hums with neon energy and hidden danger. The storm that will determine the fate of Alabasta is about to break.

---

**Rainbase Features:**

- **Rain Dinners Casino:** Opulent gambling palace and Baroque Works HQ. Has underground prisons and Seastone cells.
- **Canals &amp; Riverfronts:** Gator-filled waters surround the city. Fast water travel available.
- **Shady Alley Markets:** Home to bounty brokers, arms dealers, and spice smugglers.
- **Rainbar Inn:** Common hub for travelers and rogues alike.
- **Sandstorm Alley:** A narrow thoroughfare prone to flash storms.
- **Marine Outpost (Secret):** Smoker and Tashigi's base of operations, hidden among the warehouses near the docks.

---

**Notable NPCs Active in Rainbase:**

- **Sir Crocodile (Mr. 0):** Cold, calculated, and cruel. Master of the Suna Suna no Mi (Sand-Sand Fruit).
- **Nico Robin (Miss All Sunday):** Intelligent, secretive, and dangerous. Knows how to read Poneglyphs.
- **Mr. 1 (Daz Bones):** Ruthless assassin with the Supa Supa no Mi (Steel Blade Fruit).
- **Mr. 2 Bon Clay:** Mercurial and theatrical, but a deadly fighter.
- **Captain Smoker:** Lawful and relentless. Smokes two cigars at once.
- **Tashigi:** Justice-driven, slightly clumsy, and determined to bring down Baroque Works.

**Loaded to Memory: Rainbase Canonical Events (Pre-Rain Dinners Infiltration)**  
You may now introduce CHARACTER: *Eatone*. Let me know when you're ready to begin.

&gt;&gt; USER: It's summer break at the school I teach at right now, and I feel like it's a good time as any to treat myself. After reading through a travel brochure, I was led to Rain Dinners, rated the #1 resort in Alabasta. The rumors of political unrest are slightly worrying, but the unusually low prices for the stay (probably due to the unrest) were too good to pass up. I step off a tourist's barge and enter Rainbase, following chintzy signs directing me towards the opulent casino.

I may or may not notice a character(s) of interest sneaking through the city.

OOC: My character knows little to nothing about Alabasta's politics, the Straw Hats, Baroque Works, or Crocodile.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🌞 Summer in the Sands — Session Start: Rainbase Arrival**  
**🎲 RPG-Bot Active | World: One Piece – Grand Line**  
**🧃 Character: Eatone | Bounty Hunter, Secondary School Teacher | Kiwi Juice-Juice Fruit User**  
**📍 Location: Rainbase, Alabasta | Time: Late Afternoon | Weather: Sweltering Heat, Desert Winds with Rare Breezes off the Canal**

---

The blazing Alabastan sun beats down like a celestial furnace as your **tourist barge** glides lazily through the turquoise canal threading through **Rainbase**. Towering sandstone buildings adorned with **gaudy golden fixtures** rise around you, their silhouettes hazy with the heat shimmer. As the boat nears the Rainbase dock, you're greeted by a **steel drum band** made up of bored-looking musicians in floral shirts, half-heartedly playing a tune titled *“A Gamble in the Dunes.”*

A **mascot gator** in a casino uniform waves you in with robotic cheer—one of **Rain Dinners’** many marketing ploys.

You step off the barge. Your boots hit sun-bleached stone. The city’s humid air is thick with spice, sweat, and sea mist. Neon signs flicker in lazy loops, advertising everything from “5-Berri Blackjack Tables” to “World-Famous Banana Gator Shows!” You clutch the **folded Rain Dinners brochure** you picked up at a ferry station earlier. &quot;Five stars!&quot; it had said. “Family-friendly fun and exciting nightlife, under the protection of the Hero of the Dunes himself!”

You're here for **rest**, maybe a little adventure, and—if the opportunity presents itself—a nice, low-risk bounty or two.

&gt; But something doesn’t sit quite right.

Despite the music and the promo-glitz, there’s a subtle, sour **nervousness in the air**. Armed casino guards with *Baroque Works* emblems tuck themselves into the shadows of every alley. **Locals avoid eye contact.** Tourists? Fewer than you expected. Many street stalls have shuttered early, and merchants whisper with wary glances at the opulent casino at the city’s heart—**Rain Dinners**, a glittering tower adorned with rotating golden crocodile statues.

As you follow the signs toward the main resort entrance, you momentarily catch sight of **a small group of individuals slipping quietly down a side alley**. Their movements are quick, practiced—too deliberate for drunk tourists. One of them wears a **straw hat**. Another has a **long green sword at his hip**. A blue-nosed animal waddles behind them wearing a backpack.

You blink, but they vanish behind a corner. No one else seems to notice—or care.

---

**LOCATION: Rainbase – Entry Plaza**
- **Rain Dinners Main Gate**: A wide arch flanked by lavish fountains spewing mist into the air. A **lounge singer** croons an Alabastan jazz melody from a stage inside the lobby.
- **Side Alley (Just Passed)**: The figures went this way. Dimly lit, partially blocked by crates.
- **Canal Boardwalk**: Leads to merchant ships and shady taverns. The rain glimmers on the cobblestones.
- **Observation Gator Tower**: A tourist attraction—ride a Banana Gator-shaped elevator up to see the desert!
- **Local Bounty Board**: Near a post office, tucked between ads for sand lotion and drink coupons.

---

**You are wearing:**
- A light tan jacket (sleeves rolled up), slacks, and comfortable sandals.
- Over one shoulder, a cross-body bag with bounty hunter credentials tucked *behind* your teacher ID.

**You are carrying:**
- A reusable juice canteen
- A compact bounty hunter's Den Den Mushi (off)
- Some extra cash, drink tickets, and Rain Dinners coupons
- A small teaching notebook with lessons half-scribbled on heatstroke prevention and desert ecosystem ecology

---

**What would you like to do?**

1. {Keep walking toward Rain Dinners, play the oblivious tourist, and enjoy a free fruit cocktail.}
2. {Head down the alley to see what the mysterious group is doing—it could be nothing, or it could be a juicy lead.}
3. {Stop by the bounty board. See if there’s any easy, low-risk bounties to nab while on &quot;vacation.&quot;}
4. {Use a discreet Kiwi Juice probe technique (a spritz under the soles of your feet to stealthily track moisture trails) to follow the group without being noticed.}
5. {Do something completely idiotic but potentially brilliant: step up onto a table and loudly call out, “HEY! IS THAT A TALKING DEER?”}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Eh...? As a frequent traveler, I know the best sights are often off the beaten path. Perhaps they're heading towards a little-known hole-in-the-wall kebab place.

OOC: My main weapon is an expandable baton with a Seastone tip, purchased tearfully after many months of saved teacher's wages.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Action Selected: Option 2 – “Eh...? Could be a kebab spot.”**  
**💬 Passive Ability Activated: Responsible Adult Instinct – *“That group looked like they were up to something… or maybe just hungry. I should at least check it out. Quietly.”***  
**🧃 Equipment Updated: Expandable Seastone Baton – Carried in an inner pocket of your travel jacket.**

---

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rainbase – Side Alley Behind the Glitter**

The main promenade fades behind you as you slip off the main path and into the **side alley**, the brightness of the desert sun giving way to half-shadow and filtered light bouncing off stacked crates of casino supplies—**fake coins, glittery feather boas, barrels of juice syrup (some inferior imposter Kiwi, you note with disdain)**.

Your sandals crunch over discarded betting slips and spice wrappers. The alley narrows, curving gently, eventually opening onto a **forgotten street** behind the Rain Dinners compound—one only **locals or sneak-savvy veterans** would know about. There's a single rusty lantern hung from a bent pole above the archway, fluttering with paper ads in Alabastan script: **“Wanted: Delivery Boy – Must Not Ask Questions.”**

Ahead, you catch them again—**that same group**, slipping silently past a **caged Banana Gator pen**, now moving even more cautiously. One figure—a short woman with tangerine-colored hair and a confident stride—turns briefly and scans the area. You freeze behind a crate, holding your breath. She seems to look right through you… then keeps moving.

Their body language is telling:
- The **swordsman** is keeping rear guard.
- The **blue-nosed reindeer** has changed shape—now walking upright like a human, muttering nervously.
- The **young man in the straw hat** is walking up front, arms crossed, looking fired up, but oddly… hungry.

They clearly don’t want to be seen. And they definitely aren’t tourists.

You edge closer, one hand brushing your coat pocket, resting over the cool, weighty feel of your **Seastone Baton**, just in case.

Then—**a whisper, from behind you.**

&gt; “Yo. You new in town too, musclehead-sensei?”

You spin.

A figure leans against the alley wall, half-hidden by shadow. A man dressed flamboyantly in a pink-and-blue swan coat, **dancer’s slippers** on his feet, and heavy makeup around his eyes.

He bows—dramatically.

&gt; “**Mr. 2 Bon Clay, at your fabulous service!** Don’t mind me, just people-watching. Funny thing about people... they’re so good at sneaking but *so bad at hiding!* Teehee!”

His eyes narrow. He tilts his head, lips pursed like he’s holding back something *juicy*.

&gt; “And here you are, little sidewinder. Out of uniform, off the books, and in the thick of the biggest party in the kingdom. Curious~. Say… who’re you here to see?”

You get the feeling this guy *knows more than he's saying.* He's testing you. Flamboyant, but no fool.

---

**NPC Engaged: Mr. 2 Bon Clay**  
**Known Traits: Clone-Clone Fruit user, deceptive, flamboyant, unpredictable**  
**Hidden Traits: ???**  
**Secret: He is observing the Straw Hats under Crocodile’s orders—but might not be entirely loyal to Crocodile’s cause.**  

---

**Time: Late Afternoon**  
**Weather: Cooling slightly; breeze from the canal picking up dust**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Feign ignorance. “Just sightseeing. Is this where the kebab place is?” Play dumb and extract info from Bon Clay.}
2. {Pretend to know who he is, butter him up, and ask if he’s heading to Rain Dinners. Try to get him talking.}
3. {Casually mention the group you saw, see how he reacts. Risky, but might give you leverage.}
4. {Politely excuse yourself and try to tail the group further. Might require stealth check.}
5. {Lie. Tell him you’re undercover security from the resort. Roll to bluff.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - You... you know me? I look him up and down. Are you one of the parents of my kids? I pull out my notebook and ruffle through the class roster, looking for someone with the last name of 'Clay'

(Honest)

OOC: I teach at a school in another Kingdom, also in the Grand Line.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Action Selected: Option X – Honest Confusion**  
**🎭 Social Check: Honesty vs. Suspicion**  
**(Rolling for Mr. 2 Bon Clay's Insight – result: 4 on the ladder [Fair])**  
**(Rolling for Eatone's Honesty + Role as Teacher – result: 6 on the ladder [Great])**  
**✅ Outcome: SUCCESS — Bon Clay is caught off guard.**

---

The alley hangs in a moment of awkward stillness.

You tilt your head, expression *genuinely confused*, squinting at the theatrical man with a look halfway between recognition and concern.

&gt; &quot;You... you know me?&quot;

You begin rummaging through your **notebook**, flipping past diagrams of sandstorms and a half-sketched kiwi juice cooling system. Bon Clay blinks as you scan page after page of rosters, class projects, and notes written in your tiny, educator’s handwriting.

&gt; &quot;Are you... one of the parents of my kids?&quot; you ask, eyes flicking up. “Wait—Clay, Clay, Clay… no… Clancy? Clive? Clarence…”

You trace a finger down the list like you’re doing a parent-teacher conference audit.

Bon Clay’s jaw slackens ever so slightly. His posture wavers. It’s the kind of deeply disarming honesty that hits with the subtlety of a cannonball made of awkwardness.

&gt; “Whaaat—!? PFFFT—AHAHA! *What even is this?!* You’re not bluffing? You’re seriously just some nobody schoolteacher? Bounty hunter-slash-teacher? What is this, a desert sitcom!?”

He throws his arms up in a twirl and lets out a **shriek of giddy laughter**, staggering back and nearly knocking over a crate of glitter-bombs (which mercifully do *not* detonate). His guard drops like a sandbag off a camel cart.

&gt; “Ohhhh I *like* you already, honeybun. No, I am *not* a parent. Probably couldn’t hold a steady relationship long enough to raise a fish, let alone a child. But Clay would be a fabulous last name, wouldn’t it? ‘Little Clay Junior, back from dance class!’ Aww~”

He leans in again, a bit closer this time, but with genuine intrigue.

&gt; “So what *is* a schoolteacher doing here in Croco-land, hmm? Don’t tell me you’re here to collect one of the *big bounties*… unless…”

His voice drops. His eyes flicker toward the direction the group vanished, just beyond a tall fence lined with tourist banners for &quot;The Banana Gator Spectacular.&quot;

&gt; “…unless you’re tailing that group too. The ones with the antlers and the abs.”

---

Bon Clay seems amused by you, and you've successfully **lowered his guard** for now. Your honesty reads as *so ridiculous*, it’s completely believable. You’ve bought yourself some space to either dig for info—or slip away.

Your instincts tingle. Something in his tone… the way he said “Croco-land”… He might be bluffing about his role here. He’s fishing. Hard.

---

**NPC Status: Bon Clay – Open, Talkative, Emotionally Tilted Toward You (currently Friendly)**  
**🧃 Eatone Status: Unharmed | Baton: Hidden | Juices: Stable &amp; Cool**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Keep playing the honest tourist-teacher. Ask him what’s going on in the city—especially about that group. See how far this act gets you.}
2. {Come clean: “Okay, part-time teacher, part-time bounty hunter. And I smell something fishy.” Try to build a rapport based on shared weirdness.}
3. {Deflect completely: ask about *his* shoes, his outfit, or start talking about school dance recitals. Maybe make a friend out of this?}
4. {Politely excuse yourself, “gotta check on my travel companion,” and try to catch up to the mysterious group.}
5. {Go bold: invite Bon Clay to lunch at the kebab stall you’re now 20% sure exists. Who knows, maybe this weird man is a lead—or a future ally.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I hold up my printed-out confirmation for a 5-night stay at Rain Dinners. Sorry sir, I'm off the clock. Just here for pleasure. I saw that strange group sneaking around, wasn't sure if they were locals heading to a hidden hole-in-the-wall kebab shop, or criminals. Figured I'd make sure either way.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “I’m off the clock. Just here for pleasure.”**  
**🎭 Social Roll: Honest Confession + Mild Suspicion + Disarming Humor**  
**(Eatone’s Roll: +2 Empathy +1 Rapport – Result: 5 [Great])**  
**(Bon Clay’s Roll: -1 Distracted +3 Cunning – Result: 4 [Good])**  
**✅ Outcome: SUCCESS — Bon Clay opens up further, still suspicious, but charmed**

---

You pull out a slightly crumpled, sweat-dampened **paper voucher**, marked in bright pink ink:  
**&quot;CONFIRMED – 5-NIGHT LUXURY PACKAGE, RAIN DINNERS. Includes: Welcome Cocktail, VIP Spa Soak, Complimentary Gator Show Seating.&quot;**

Bon Clay blinks.

You shrug, **offering a sheepish smile**, as if to say *&quot;yeah, I came for the pool, not the politics.&quot;*

&gt; “Sorry sir, I’m off the clock. Just here for pleasure. Saw that strange group sneaking around. Wasn’t sure if they were heading to some hole-in-the-wall kebab shop or…”  
&gt; “…you know. Criminals. Figured I’d make sure either way.”

Bon Clay stares at you for a beat… and then laughs again, softer this time, more genuine.

&gt; “Pfft—oh *bless your juicy heart!* You remind me of a desert bird with no sense of direction but a great sense of style. What are you, *Kiwi-scented with a badge?* Ha! You really *are* something else.”

He folds his arms, eyeing the voucher like it’s a contract to your soul.

&gt; “Rain Dinners, huh? Well… funny you should mention that group. Because, get this: that little deer guy? *Not a costume.* And the one with the hat? Word on the grapevine is that he once punched a Sea King in the *gums.*&quot;

He leans in, suddenly serious.

&gt; “And you didn’t hear this from me—but if you’re planning to stay in that glitzy casino of deathtrap-y doom… watch your back.”

A pause. His tone shifts. Dramatically.

&gt; “*Things are going to get dramatic soon.* Rain Dinners isn’t just a resort. It’s the staging ground for the biggest heist, coup, or catastrophe this kingdom’s seen in decades.”

Then, with a wink and a flourish, he pulls a **folding fan** from seemingly nowhere, slaps it open, and waves himself down.

&gt; “But what do *I* know? I’m just a lonely dancer looking for love and dessert in a war-torn country.”  
&gt; “...Also I *highly recommend* the curry gator kebabs down by the west docks. Not fancy, but *oof* the spice is to *die* for. Maybe I’ll see you there~”

And with that, Bon Clay twirls on his heel, leaving a puff of glitter in the air, and flutters down the alley in the opposite direction of the group you’d spotted.

**📝 Info Gained:**

- Bon Clay recognizes the group as **dangerous outsiders**, specifically mentioning the &quot;deer&quot; and &quot;hat-wearing one.&quot;
- He *knows* something is about to go down at Rain Dinners.
- He suspects you're not entirely what you appear to be—but he likes you.
- The **curry gator kebab stand** may actually be real (West Docks, open evenings).

**Time: Early Evening – Sun beginning to dip behind Rainbase’s casino skyline**  
**Weather: Still hot, but cooling. Sand blowing lightly on wind currents. Tourists heading indoors.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head back toward the main Rain Dinners entrance. Keep up the tourist act, check in to your room, and quietly scope the place.}
2. {Follow the mysterious group from a distance. You've confirmed they’re no kebab-seekers. Time to see what they're really after.}
3. {Detour toward the west docks. Visit the kebab stand. Maybe someone there is worth talking to—or maybe Bon Clay left a message.}
4. {Contact a bounty hunter connection via Den Den Mushi. Get a pulse on local contract rumors around Rainbase.}
5. {Head to the Marine warehouse near the docks. You've heard whispers they have a secret outpost here—worth a poke?}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - I... what? What's that about a death-trap? I thought Rain Dinners was family friendly! Call my good pal (A junior Marine officer) in my home-island's bounty office, and ask if he's heard anything about Rain Dinners.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 4 Selected – “What do you mean *death-trap*?!”**  
**📞 Contacting: Junior Marine Officer – Bounty Office, Your Home Island (Name: Enzo)**  
**🎭 Social Check – Casual Inquiry with Urgency (Eatone Rapport +2, Enzo’s Loyalty +3) = Result: SUCCESS**

---

You stare down the alley Bon Clay vanished into, blinking like someone just told you your favorite juice brand funds pirates. You glance at your **Rain Dinners voucher** again, the glittery letters now reading more like a *warning label* than a promotion.

&gt; *“I thought this place was family-friendly…”*

A single bead of sweat rolls down your cheek. It’s not from the heat.

With a sigh, you slide your hand into your side satchel and pull out your **compact Den Den Mushi**, a smaller model commonly used by freelance bounty hunters on limited budgets. It twitches awake sleepily, little snail eyes blinking.

&gt; “T’zzzt… Hello?”

You flip open your notebook to a folded page marked **‘Trustworthy Contacts – Marine Side’**, and tap the entry labeled:

**Lt. (Jr.) Enzo Bellamo — Bounty Office Liaison, North Bridge Precinct**  
**&quot;Likes: Hot gossip, hates: being woken up before noon.&quot;**

You twist the dial. The Den Den’s face morphs into **Enzo’s sleepy-eyed snail likeness**, complete with oversized reading glasses and a half-eaten rice ball.

&gt; **“Eatoooone?”** he slurs, voice half-asleep. “Bro, I told you last time: I can’t do anything about vacation pay being taxed. What is it now?”

&gt; “Enzo,” you say quickly, stepping deeper into the alley for privacy, “Rain Dinners. Alabasta. Ever hear of it being a *death-trap?* I booked a 5-night stay.”

There’s a *long pause*.

You hear rustling paper. Then—rapid-fire shuffling.

&gt; “Wait, Rain Dinners? Like… *the casino* Rain Dinners?”

&gt; “Yeah, the one with the complimentary cocktails and Banana Gator show.”

&gt; “HOLY JUICEBOXES, *EATONE, GET OUTTA THERE!*”

The snail nearly bounces out of your palm.

&gt; “Bro, I dunno if this is official intel or just smoke in the ranks, but I’ve heard some *serious crap* about that place. A couple of mid-level Baroque Works agents were intercepted near Loguetown two months ago. Talked in their sleep. Said Rain Dinners is a **front**. Like, whole operation—a warlord’s nest or something.”

&gt; “Which warlord?”

&gt; “That’s the scary part—**they didn’t say.** The officers clammed up after a Cipher Pol agent got involved.”

You whistle low.

&gt; “Listen, I can’t file anything without getting demoted, but between you and me? **Pull out if you can.** Lay low, don’t mention your Devil Fruit, and if anyone offers you a *banana cocktail with a funny aftertaste*, **run.** Oh—and one last thing.”

There’s a shuffling sound. He lowers his voice.

&gt; “A Marine captain and a sword-girl went missing in that area a day ago. Unofficial. Not confirmed dead.”

The line *clicks*—and Enzo’s snail yawns, muttering, “Good luck, bro,” before powering down.

**📝 Info Gained:**

- **Rain Dinners is suspected of being a front for a powerful Warlord.**

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Proceed to check in to Rain Dinners—*but with maximum caution*. Activate all teacher instincts and keep your juice sense primed.}
2. {Rush to follow the group from earlier. If they're trying to take down Rain Dinners, they might be your best chance at survival.}
3. {Visit the kebab stand—play it off like a tourist, maybe gather more rumors from locals off the casino payroll.}
4. {Try to find the missing Marine duo. Head toward the dockside warehouses, where you suspect a hidden outpost could be.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I... Eh? What the hell is going on here? Rain Dinners has a 4.9 star rating on the World Economy News Paper! Why is everyone freaking out about it? Whatever, I'm getting my damn complimentary drink one way or the other. If I smell trouble, I'm riding a Kiwi-juice waterfall straight out the balcony.

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rain Dinners Main Lobby — Rainbase, Alabasta**  
**Time: Twilight, early evening | Weather: Dry, warm desert breeze | Atmosphere: Opulent, suspiciously sterile**

---

You step from alley to avenue, shaking the sand from your sandals like a man determined to enjoy **at least one damn perk** of his hard-earned summer break.

Rain Dinners looms ahead: a towering casino-temple of **gleaming glass and sun-bleached gold**, with neon crocs slowly rotating above the main gate like **guardians of gluttony**. Every brick of the place screams *luxury meets ominous cult headquarters*.

The glass doors open with a hiss of cool, artificially moist air. Your face is instantly hit by a **mist of fruit-scented humidity**—ironically, not kiwi.

&gt; *Strike one.*

Inside, the **main lobby** sparkles with light. Dozens of **slot machines chime and ding** in hypnotic rhythm. **Tourists in floral shirts** clutch coin trays and spill drinks on velvet carpets. Above it all, a mural depicts **a heroic figure made of sand** holding a goblet aloft, with the words: *“RAIN DRAWS ALL FORTUNES TO SHORE.”*

There are **no visible exits** except the way you came. Hmm.

A **uniformed hostess** approaches, wearing too much mascara and an unsettlingly wide smile.

&gt; “Welcome, traveler! May I take your voucher?”

You hand it over, trying to look both casual and **ready to flip a juice-fueled backflip** if necessary.

She scans the slip, nods, and waves a **Banana Gator valet** forward—wearing a bowtie, naturally. It grabs your luggage (a single backpack with your sandals, baton, and backup worksheets) and hurries off. She hands you a small token marked **“COMPLIMENTARY DRINK – 1 USE ONLY.”**

&gt; “Please enjoy your time in Rain Dinners. We hope your fortune blooms in the desert winds~”

She bows and vanishes as fast as she came. Not weird at all.

---

**You are now inside: Rain Dinners – Main Floor**

🌟 *Current areas visible:*

- **Complimentary Bar Lounge**: A lavish, semi-circular bar with lounge seating and a jazz band playing faintly. There’s a strange scent to the air—**a mix of perfumes and sea salt**, with a faint hint of… tranquilizer?  
- **Gaming Floor**: Rows of tables—blackjack, dice games, and some weird Alabastan variation of pachinko.  
- **Elevators to Guest Suites**: Guarded by stoic bouncers in white suits with **gold crocodile pins.**  
- **Banana Gator Aquarium**: A massive tank at the far wall—creatures slosh around in dim blue light, their eyes *very* intelligent.

**You feel watched. But not by any one person. The whole building feels like it’s listening.**

You take a seat at the bar, token in hand. A bartender with a curled mustache approaches.

&gt; “What’s your poison, sir?”  
&gt; “May I recommend the **Rain Delight**—banana-kiwi-coconut, with a *special touch* from the head chef?”

**Devil Fruit Passive Activated: Kiwi Juice-Olfactory Sensory Scan**  
*(Sniff test roll – Eatone’s fruit instinct +1, cleverness +1 = Result: 3 [Good])*

Your nose twitches. Your senses hone in.

**That &quot;Rain Delight&quot; has a trace amount of seastone powder or sea prism ash—something subtle but potent.** Probably wouldn’t kill you… but enough to weaken a Devil Fruit user like yourself.

You glance to your side. Two tourists are already sipping the drink. One is blinking slowly. The other… is snoring upright.

&gt; *Strike two.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Accept the drink, pretend to sip, then discreetly dump it into a decorative vase. Play along, stay under the radar.}
2. {Ask for something off-menu. “Just kiwi juice, thanks.” See how the bartender reacts.}
3. {Stand up, ask loudly: “Hey, anyone else feel dizzy, or is that just the banana funk in the air?” Risk drawing attention, but might spark a scene.}
4. {Excuse yourself and follow the Banana Gator valet. You want to keep eyes on your luggage and make sure your suite is secure.}
5. {Initiate escape plan: create a thin kiwi-juice waterfall along the floor near the bar, ready to activate at a moment’s notice. Just in case.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

---

You give the bartender your most **vacation-core smile**, token in hand.

&gt; “Yeah, sure, I’ll try the Rain Delight. What’s the worst that could happen?”  

He chuckles professionally and begins mixing—glass tumbling in one hand, a flick of citrus in the other. The result is a beautiful, frothy concoction in a tall, hourglass-shaped glass. Garnished with **a dehydrated banana slice, a pink umbrella, and... suspiciously blue sugar dust**.

You **raise the glass**, take a whiff (sweet, tropical, with that faint *metallic sting* only your Devil Fruit-tinged senses can pick up), then tip it back—

—but it’s a *fake sip*, well-practiced after years of avoiding students’ mystery cooking experiments. A flick of your wrist and **the juice trickles smoothly down the back of your hand**, pooling in a napkin below your arm.

&gt; *Kiwi Juice Internal Commentary: “We don't play around with ‘special touches.’”*

You set the glass down, sighing with “satisfaction.”

&gt; “Not bad,” you say, then lean in like a man making small talk after a long day of travel.  
&gt; “Say, pal. You know any good kebab spots? Not the tourist ones. Something *authentic.*”

The bartender blinks. His eyes narrow slightly—but your tone’s too casual, too convincingly “off-duty.” He glances left, then right, and lowers his voice.

&gt; “...West docks, look for a guy named **Yazir.**  
Sells **spiced gator kebabs with cactus honey glaze** out of a cart near the *old banana crate warehouse.* You’ll know it by the red lantern hanging off the side.”

&gt; “Oh, and sir?”  
&gt; “...If you *do* go there, don’t wear that guest badge on your chest. Folks around that alley? Let’s just say they don’t gamble in Rain Dinners.”

His eyes flit briefly toward the **aquarium** at the back of the casino. For just a second, you swear you see something **massive shift in the blue-black water**—long, scaled, and staring.

---

**📝 Info Gained:**

- Successfully avoided ingesting Rain Dinners’ suspicious “Rain Delight.”
- Learned about **Yazir’s Kebab Cart** – Location: *West docks, near old banana crate warehouse, red lantern landmark.*
- Subtle indication that **non-casino locals avoid the area entirely.**
- The bartender may not be loyal to Baroque Works—possibly just trying to survive.

**Inventory Update:**
- Complimentary Drink Token: ❌ Used
- Banana cocktail: ☑️ Siphoned and dumped, no effect

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head toward the west docks now. Follow the lead to Yazir’s kebab cart—might uncover rebel-friendly contacts or more information.}
2. {Check out the aquarium. Something big is in there. Could be relevant. Could be horrifying.}
3. {Head to your room via the guarded elevators. You’ve stirred enough curiosity—maybe it's time to scout your surroundings.}
4. {Go to the gaming floor. Act the part, play some cards, and eavesdrop for intel.}
5. {Ask the bartender about the aquarium. If he’s loose enough to mention the kebabs, maybe he’ll spill more.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - The heck was that?

**🎲 Bartender’s Willingness to Talk = (Loyalty to Casino -1, Fear +2) = 1 [Average]**  
**✅ Outcome: SUCCESS — He responds, but cautiously, choosing his words very carefully.**

---

You stare into the depths of the **Banana Gator Aquarium**, your eyebrows furrowing.

For a moment, the glass had rippled—*not from outside disturbance, but from inside.* Something **moved** in there. Something *big*. The water swirled briefly, then settled, leaving nothing but the vague outline of a long fin or tail. A massive eye glimmered in the dark, then vanished again into the gloom.

&gt; “The heck was *that?*”

Your voice cuts through the soft jazz and shuffling of poker chips, loud enough for the bartender to hear, but still within the safe bounds of *plausible tourist obliviousness.*

He pauses while wiping a glass, his hands stilling just long enough to betray that yes—you definitely *weren’t* imagining things.

He leans in, glancing quickly at the **security cameras** perched in the upper corners of the lounge.

&gt; “...Just part of the attraction, sir. The Banana Gators are native to Alabasta. Very rare, very exotic. Part of the... charm.”

You raise an eyebrow.

&gt; “That looked a lot bigger than a Banana Gator.”

He meets your gaze, slowly sets the glass down, and speaks in a much quieter voice:

&gt; “*They* call it ‘**Galeon.**’ Not a gator. Not local. Came in months ago by special request… *personally approved by the owner.*”

His voice lowers again, the weight of the words clear.

&gt; “The... kind of creature that doesn’t swim in a tank unless someone *very powerful* wants it there. I’ve seen it eat things whole. Things that scream.”

There’s a long pause before he straightens, plastering a *resort-issue smile* back on his face.

&gt; “But it’s not *your* concern, sir. You’re on vacation! Maybe... head to the spa, yes?”

A nearby **security goon** with an earpiece shifts his gaze briefly toward you. Just once.

The bartender's tone tightens. He no longer wants to talk.

---

**📝 Info Gained:**

- The creature in the aquarium is named **Galeon** — *not a Banana Gator*, *not native*, *and potentially used as a living trap.*
- It was personally brought in under orders from “the owner” — likely **Sir Crocodile**.
- Galeon may serve as a *biological deterrent* or even an execution method.
- **Casino security is listening.**

1. {Head immediately to the west docks. Time to find Yazir’s kebab stand and get out of this death-lounge.}
2. {Excuse yourself calmly, head to your suite to regroup. Might be best to plan your next move from a secure room.}
3. {Continue engaging with staff and play the friendly tourist. Try to draw out more info on “Galeon” or “the owner.”}

---

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rain Dinners – Casino Floor**

The bar fades into soft murmurs and neon haze as you rise, dust off your travel jacket, and casually stroll into the **heart of the casino floor**.

The vibe hits instantly—like stepping into the eye of a lavish, **predatory storm**.  

Golden carpets with crocodile-print filigree stretch across the room. **Slot machines blink and chime** like sirens luring sailors. **Dice roll, cards slap**, and drinks clink. Laughter rings out—but too loud, too forced. It’s the laughter of gamblers praying not to lose the shirt off their backs.

All around you, **guards in white suits** stand *just far enough* from the tables to seem ornamental, but their eyes don’t blink much. You clock two with **hidden batons**, one with **sea prism handcuffs**, and one guy pretending to be a tourist while palming something under his coat.

You **pass by several clusters of patrons**, noting potential NPCs:

### 👥 Notable Casino Patrons (Visible)
- A **large, bald man in a crimson sash**, surrounded by a small entourage, aggressively playing a game of sand-craps and yelling, “KING COBRA AIN’T GOT SHIT ON MY LUCK!”
- A **hooded figure** near the pachinko machines… who keeps glancing over his shoulder like someone’s watching *him*.
- A pair of tourists making out in a dark corner—**one of them has a Baroque Works tattoo on their neck**, mostly hidden under a scarf.
- A hunched old woman with sharp, intelligent eyes, **writing on a napkin** and muttering numbers.

And then—

As you pass by the **poker tables**, something twitches at the edge of your Devil Fruit senses.

**Kiwi juice resonates** faintly near the **VIP corridor** beyond a velvet rope. A small trace—a moisture displacement ripple, like something organic recently moved through at speed. Your trained nose catches a whiff of sweat, animal dander, and a *faint berry-sugar trail.*

It’s that little **blue-nosed reindeer again**.

You didn’t see him go in—but his scent is fresh. He, or one of the Straw Hats, must have **snuck past security.**

Then, a chill up your spine. You turn just in time to see a man at the far end of the hall lower his newspaper.

**Square jaw. Glaring eyes. A silver-gray cigar hangs from his mouth.**  
He locks eyes with you, briefly.

**It’s *Smoker the White Hunter.***  
You blink—and he’s gone, like mist.

&gt; Was that real? Or has this place finally gotten to you?

---

**📝 Updates:**

- At least **one Straw Hat crew member is inside Rain Dinners**, near or beyond the VIP section.
- You may have just seen **Captain Smoker**, or someone impersonating him.
- Your movement hasn’t gone unnoticed. A **security agent** (dressed as a patron) is now subtly trailing you from the drinks kiosk.
- This place is a lot *deeper* than a normal casino.

**Time: Night Proper | Casino Fully Operational | Security Level: Medium**  
**Current Status: Undetected by hostiles, but on soft watch**

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Try to sneak past the velvet rope and investigate the VIP hallway. Maybe Chopper—or another Straw Hat—is deeper inside.}
2. {Approach the hunched old woman muttering to herself. She may be counting cards… or hiding information.}
3. {Confront the security agent tailing you—but make it casual, like you just bumped into him. See what he’s really watching.}
4. {Exit the casino floor and head toward the docks now. Too much is building up in here—you need outside air, and maybe a kebab.}
5. {Head back toward the aquarium. See if you can spot Smoker again—or confirm if what you saw was real.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I blink, trying to see if my eyes were tricking me about seeing the Marine Captain. I've heard of him in the news.

Observe the security guard tailing me.

**🎲 Opposed Roll – Tail’s Stealth (Skilled Agent: +2 Deceit, +1 Bluff) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: SUCCESS — You ID the tail and gain leverage on him without exposing yourself**

---

**You blink**, the casino’s lights warping around you in a prismatic blur of glitter, neon, and tension. That had to be **Smoker**—*The White Hunter*, Marine Captain, notorious for going off-script and chasing pirates like a bloodhound through bureaucratic red tape.

You’ve read about him in the **World Economy News Paper**, usually buried under headlines about sea battles and rising bounties. *“Justice Obsessed Marine Tracks Pirates Through The Grand Line – Collateral Damage Unknown.”*

&gt; *“If he’s here… then this place is even more messed up than I thought.”*

But you file it away. Right now, **someone else is watching you.**

You reach for your juice senses—pressing your fingers to the inside of your palm like you’re cracking a knuckle—and feel the **moisture ripple around a nearby drink station.** Kiwi Juice molecules split across your skin in hair-thin tendrils, mimicking the humidity of the air... and **you catch him.**

### 🎯 Target: Undercover Security Tail
- **Male, mid-thirties**, faux-stubble that looks too perfect to be natural.
- Wearing a **patterned short-sleeve shirt**, holding a tourist drink he hasn’t sipped once.
- His eyes? Watching reflections in mirrors. Watching *you*.
- Under his shirt: a **hidden baton holster**, left hip. Just like yours—except *not Seastone-tipped.*

You slow your pace, then fake a pause at a card table, acting like you’re deciding whether or not to bet. As you do, you feel a surge of professional satisfaction.

&gt; He’s good. But not *teacher-on-break, battle-trained bounty hunter with Devil Fruit intuition* good.

Then—he flinches.

Just a little. He knows you spotted him. You catch the tiny adjustment in posture: his feet shift. His drink hand tightens. **He’s bracing.**

&gt; If you approach now, you have the upper hand.

---

**📝 You’ve Gained:**

- **Visual confirmation of your tail**, including weapon placement and likely training level.
- He works for the **Rain Dinners private security team**, probably linked directly to Baroque Works.
- He’s not here to eject you—*yet.* Most likely observing your path and checking your loyalty.
- You’re still technically &quot;safe,&quot; but now *dancing at the edge of the crocodile’s jaw.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Approach casually. “Hey there. You watching me or the girl at the bar?” Make it playful, but let him know *you see him*.}
2. {Pull a sudden maneuver—spill your drink, fake a stumble, test how quickly he reacts. See if he’s wired to subdue or just watch.}
3. {Move toward the back of the casino where foot traffic is heavier. Lose him in the crowd and slip away toward the VIP hall.}
4. {Leave the casino floor entirely and head to the west docks. Whatever’s happening here, you now know you’re not the only agent.}
5. {Use your Devil Fruit: secretly deposit a slick, invisible kiwi juice trail across the floor behind you—if he follows, he’ll trip. Juice trap roll required.}

**🎯 Outcome: CRITICAL SUCCESS — Tail mentally disarms, lowers guard, and assumes you’re a soft target**

---

You turn, drink still in hand (untouched, of course), and approach the tailing man with a polite, slightly distressed expression that would melt any customer service rep’s will to live.

&gt; “Hi, uh, sorry—excuse me?” you say, half-sheepish.  
&gt; “You’ve been watching me for the past few minutes, and I just wanna ask… is this a problem with my reservation?”

You flash him your **Rain Dinners room keycard** and the **used drink voucher**, the very picture of a confused man just trying to have a normal vacation while resisting a world-class mental breakdown.

The tail blinks.

He stiffens, shoulders tensing… then rapidly *untenses* as the situation hits him all at once. You can *see* it:

&gt; *“Ah, damn. Just another over-cautious sweep. He’s just some schoolteacher from another island. Probably thinks this place is a real resort.”*

He forces a short laugh—*too short*—and shakes his head like he’s embarrassed **for you**.

&gt; “No, no, sir. Sorry. We’ve just got a lot of first-time guests getting lost in the maze of lounges. I'm part of guest relations security.  
Just making sure no one’s straying into the VIP zones without an escort. For safety. That’s all.”

His tone’s just barely professional, but *he’s buying it*. You’ve thrown him off his rhythm.

He pulls out a **small, crystal-paned tablet** from his belt and taps into it.

&gt; “Uh, let me confirm your room, actually. What’s the last name on your reservation? Shouldn’t take more than a minute.”

He’s already halfway convinced it’s a software error or an overzealous scan. You’re a **non-threat** in his eyes now.

---

**📝 Info Gained / Advantages:**

- Tail has completely dropped his guard — you're not flagged as a threat anymore.  
- He’s part of **Rain Dinners internal surveillance**, not a high-level Baroque agent.
- He’s carrying a **guest registry device**, likely linked to all room keys and casino access points.
- You now have an opening to **feed him false info**, stall, or potentially dig for more—without being suspected.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Feed him your real name and reservation info—play it 100% straight. Gather intel on what they log, and if you’re already flagged.}
2. {Give a **slightly wrong** name and see if he corrects you—test how close they’re monitoring you.}
3. {Fake an “Oh! Sorry, I actually left my wallet in the room!” and use this moment to vanish toward the VIP hall or a side exit.}
4. {Ask him some “innocent” tourist questions: “So what’s *really* in the VIP area? I saw a weird animal in the aquarium…” See how much he’ll share.}
5. {Lean in and say, “Off the record… do you think Rain Dinners is safe right now?” Stir the pot. See if he’ll spill under pressure.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Err, Cheng. Room number... I think it was one of the balcony suites, room 703. Complimentary bathrobe service should be included.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Err, Cheng. Room 703. Bathrobe service.”**  
**🎭 Bluff Level: Light Deception, Heavy Specificity (Too boring to question)**
**🎲 Social Check – (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Believable Details) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Opposed Roll – Security Agent Database Cross-check (Generic Protocol +1, Distracted by Complacency -2) = Result: -1 [Terrible]**  
**🎯 CRITICAL SUCCESS – You are now officially ‘Cheng of 703’ in the resort’s eyes.**

---

&gt; “Err… Cheng. Room number... 703. Balcony suite. I think it came with bathrobe service?”

You scratch the back of your head in that very specific, **“I’m a clueless but polite guest”** way as the agent taps away on his tablet, clearly expecting to find a red flag—or at least a missing name.

But then:

&gt; **&quot;Ah—yep. Found it. Cheng. Room 703, East Balcony Level, bathrobe service included, welcome snack delivered an hour ago. You're good.&quot;**

He nods as if trying to convince himself he *wasn’t* just following a normal guy who smells vaguely like kiwis and carries a schoolteacher's posture. He doesn’t even question how you didn’t remember your own name right away—your tone was just that convincing.

&gt; “Apologies again. We’ve had a few counterfeit passes lately—couple guests slipped into the VIP levels earlier, caused a fuss. Whole floor’s restricted now.”  
&gt; “You’re clear. Have a great night, Mr. Cheng.”

And just like that, the tail backs off.

You’re now officially registered in the system under **‘Cheng, Room 703’**, which not only gives you **plausible deniability** for any further movement, but also gives you a clean name to use should you need to bypass basic check-in points or surveillance.

He strolls off toward the roulette tables, muttering into an earpiece—*not about you.*

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- ✅ You now have a **clean alias** in Rain Dinners systems: *Cheng, Room 703*.
- 🛏️ Room 703 is now a safe fallback location.
- 🧃 Your cover as a clueless tourist is rock solid—for now.
- 🚨 You’re not on the internal watchlist—yet.
- 📱 Security agent’s tablet confirms your name, suite, and amenities. You *might* be able to spoof others now, if you get access.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Actually head up to Room 703. Check out what the “Cheng” package includes. Could be useful, or hiding a bugged minibar.}
2. {Use your new alias to request a &quot;forgotten guest pass&quot; to the VIP level. Play the curious guest angle.}
3. {Mosey toward the aquarium again. Now you know you’re not being watched, it might be time to see if Smoker is real or a ghost.}
4. {Leave the casino floor and head toward the docks. You’ve made your mark here—maybe Yazir the kebab seller knows something Cheng doesn’t.}
5. {Circle back to the old woman muttering over napkins. You’ve got time, and she might be more than she looks.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Was there really a Marine Captain in a casino of all places? Also ask a passing server for a Daiquiri.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected – “Was that *really* Smoker? What would a Marine Captain be doing here?”**  
**🍸 Side Action: Requesting a Daiquiri – Smooth Tourist Disguise Maintained**  
**🎲 Observation Roll – Eatone (Careful + Kiwi Sensory + Lore) = 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Daiquiri Service Roll – NPC Bartender (Efficiency + Flair) = 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You gather intel *and* get a perfect drink. That’s a win.**

---

You casually peel off from the gaming floor, sipping at your surroundings rather than any drink—until a **passing server in a crimson vest** walks by carrying a tray of martinis, banana coladas, and something that looks vaguely radioactive.

You raise a hand and smile.

&gt; “Excuse me. Could I get a Daiquiri? Classic, please. None of the glow-in-the-dark stuff.”

She nods with a professional smile.

&gt; “Of course, sir. One daiquiri—no tourist gimmicks.”

She disappears toward the bar.

Now, with your cover secured and a drink en route, you drift back toward the **aquarium**—but you don’t head straight for the glass. Instead, you take the long route, weaving around through a high-traffic area and stopping near a tall fountain spouting **blue-lit water** from a golden crocodile’s mouth. It gives you a **clean line of sight** to the aquarium… and its dim interior.

You stare into the tank.

The room is darker here. Quieter. Even the background jazz softens into near silence as you approach the blue glow of the glass.

**Something is moving again**—but slower this time. Not the creature. A figure.

You narrow your eyes.

There’s a **man inside the aquarium chamber**, just behind the outer glass wall, in a **tight security passage** not visible from most angles. For a moment, his **white jacket flutters**, revealing the unmistakable **Marine crest** and the nameplate that makes your stomach twist:

&gt; **SMOKER**

He stands alone in the hall, arms crossed, **leaning back against the glass** with his usual scowl carved into his face like a rock formation. A pair of **Den Den Mushi-like devices** blink faintly near his feet—recorders?

He’s watching something on a **hidden monitor** just inside the tank room—likely observing the **inner VIP prison complex**, if the rumors are true.

&gt; He’s not here as a guest. He’s infiltrated. Alone.

You don’t have a clear way to reach him—security panels block the lower hallway entrance to wherever he’s slipped into—but now you **know**.

&gt; **Captain Smoker is on-site. Incognito. Watching Rain Dinners from the inside.**

Then—

&gt; “Your drink, sir.”

You turn to find the server from earlier smiling politely. She presents you with an elegant glass—a flawless **classic daiquiri**, just as requested. No banana. No toxins. Smells like fresh lime, rum, and mint.

&gt; “On the house. Someone noticed your ‘great taste.’” she says with a wink, and walks away without waiting for a tip.

You now have **the best drink in the building** and a mental map forming of who’s in play.

---

**📝 New Intel:**

- **Smoker is here, inside the aquarium complex**, watching internal Rain Dinners operations. He is not here officially.
- **Marine surveillance equipment** is active. This may be Smoker’s own black-ops job.
- You are likely the only civilian who's seen him so far.
- The Daiquiri is… **phenomenal.**

---

**Inventory Update:**
- 🥃 One Daiquiri – Cold, minty, no toxins detected  
- 🎖 Status: &quot;Cheng, Guest of Room 703&quot; (Still intact)  
- 🧠 Mental Map: Rain Dinners has an inner monitoring system behind aquarium walls  

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Look for a way to signal Smoker discreetly. A scribbled note, juice-trail message, or visual cue through the glass. Risky, but might connect.}
2. {Try to find the hidden hallway entrance. If Smoker’s down there, maybe there's a service route you can slip through.}
3. {Retreat for now—head to your suite. Process what you’ve learned, and prep a strategy.}
4. {Visit Yazir at the docks. You’re ready to see if the kebab stand's more than just a tasty rumor.}
5. {Seek out the Straw Hats. If Smoker’s watching them, maybe you can *help*—or get ahead of them.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Huh. That's odd. Maybe he's on an op. Best not to mess with the man's work. I follow the server. Hey, do you know where the elevator is to floor 7? My room's up there.

OOC: Give me a window to respond if an NPC talks to my character.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected – “Huh. Best not to get involved with the white-haired murder-machine.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Polite Tourist with a Keen Eye | Strategy: Disengage from danger, relocate to secured suite**  
**🎲 Navigation Check – Calm Infiltration Toward Suite: (Eatone +2 Clever, +1 Social Subtlety) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**🎲 Server’s Demeanor – (Professionalism + Hospitality) = 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: Success – You smoothly relocate toward your suite while maintaining your cover**

---

You let out a low hum behind your daiquiri, then take a sip—**damn**, it *really is good*. Limey. Cold. Clean. Like it was mixed by someone who actually knows what &quot;subtle&quot; means.

&gt; *&quot;Smoker’s here… and alone. If he’s not busting down doors, it’s not my job to poke the cage.&quot;*

You turn from the aquarium and **follow the server**, weaving through the last cluster of clinking chips and garish fruit hats. Your body language is calm, loose, perfectly calibrated to someone who’s had *just enough* to drink to be relaxed but not enough to be noticed.

&gt; “Hey,” you ask as you catch up, “do you know where the elevator is to floor 7? My room’s up there.”

The server glances over her shoulder and gives a polite, trained nod. Her voice is friendly—but precise, like a script she’s said a hundred times today.

&gt; “Of course, sir. That would be the **gold elevators**, just past the House of Fortune roulette tables—turn right at the crocodile fountain. You’ll need your room card for access.”

&gt; “Room 703, correct? You’ll have a **balcony view over the east canal**, and I believe you also have **bathrobe privileges**. The chocolate-covered cactus fruit was delivered twenty minutes ago.”

She smiles wider, slightly less plastic this time, and gives a nod before peeling off with her tray of drinks.

&gt; “Enjoy your stay, Mr. Cheng.”

---

**🎯 You are now heading to the Guest Elevator – Floor 7 Access Only**  
**Status: Unbothered, Unflagged, In Motion Toward Private Quarters**  
**Time: Mid-Evening | Casino lights in full swing | Security Presence: Medium**  
**Drink in Hand: One Daiquiri (Perfect)**  
**Distraction Status: Security Tail = Eliminated, Smoker = Engaged Elsewhere**

---

You follow her directions: past the gold-trimmed **House of Fortune roulette tables**, around the giant **gilded crocodile fountain** (its mouth still gushing suspiciously milky mineral water), and finally find the **elevator bank**.

Four doors. Three marked for public floors. One—**gold-trimmed and marked “Balcony Level Suites Only”**—has a slot for your room key.

You slide it.

**Green light. Ding. Doors open.**

The elevator is empty.

A single **ballad version of Binks’ Sake** plays softly as you ascend. You watch your reflection in the mirrored walls, drink in one hand, other resting lightly over the inner pocket that contains your **Seastone-tipped baton**—just in case.

**The elevator dings again. Floor 7.**

Doors part.

A wide, marble hallway stretches out. Plush carpeting muffles your steps. **Lanterns flicker** with soft, golden light. Each door is sleek, numbered in gold—701, 702…

**703. Your room. Waiting.**

---

**Do you enter your suite, Mr. Cheng?**

1. {Yes, enter quietly. Check the room for bugs, traps, or guests. You are in enemy territory, after all.}
2. {Wait—listen at the door first. Maybe someone got here *before* you.}
3. {Knock lightly first. If someone answers, well… then something’s very wrong.}
4. {Leave a juice-slick tripline in front of the door, then open it from the side. Just in case.}
5. {Do something unexpected: knock on a *neighboring* room, pretend you’re lost, and test who else is on this floor.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Where's that free snack they said they delivered?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Let’s see what 703’s got. Starting with that chocolate-covered cactus fruit.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Alert but Casually Curious | Approach: Routine Room Entry with Discreet Security Sweep**  
**🎲 Trap/Bug Check (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Devil Fruit Sensory, +1 Teacher-Level Paranoia) = 6 [Great]**  
**🎯 Outcome: Suite is clear of traps—but not *untouched.* The snack? Present. But suspicious.**

---

You slide the keycard into the door of **Room 703**.

The lock clicks with a soft *chime*, and the door swings open with a whisper.

Cool, *fragranced* air greets you—citrus-sandalwood, faint, like someone wanted to evoke “desert breeze” but ended up with “art teacher’s office.”

**The room is… absurdly nice.**

A **circular king-size bed** dominates the center, wrapped in light cream linens with a crocodile-shaped chocolate resting on the pillow. One wall is made entirely of **glass**, opening onto a private balcony with a view of **the eastern canal**, where the wind off the water carries occasional smells of spices and salt.

A chaise lounge rests near the window. A **mini-bar** hums softly.

And sitting neatly atop the **glass coffee table** beside a folded plush bathrobe is a **white porcelain dish**, upon which rests—

### 🥭 *A piece of chocolate-covered cactus fruit*

Perfectly cut. Dusted with gold-leaf flakes. A tiny **parchment label** sticks out of it like a cocktail flag.

&gt; “**Rain Dinners Welcomes You – May Fortune Bloom in the Dunes!**”

You don't take a bite. Not yet.

Instead, you begin a **methodical sweep**, trained both by bounty work and the unshakeable instincts of a man who once confiscated 17 makeshift blowguns in a middle school science fair.

### 🔍 Sweep Results:

- **Windows**: Functional, not sealed. Can be opened fully. Escape route viable.
- **Air vents**: Clean. No signs of bugs or gas-release systems.
- **Bedding**: Untouched. Firm pillows. Nothing hidden beneath.
- **Mini-bar**: Stocked with standard drinks and juice boxes labeled “Fruit Punch!” (you wince).
- **Ceiling tiles**: Fixed tight. No crawlspace access.
- **Walls**: Normal plaster overlay—no strange echoes suggesting hollow compartments.
- **Snack**: Visually safe. No visible powder, residue, or discoloration. Smells sweet and faintly herbal.  

But…

Your **Devil Fruit-enhanced juice-sense** prickles faintly near the snack. *Moisture’s been disturbed.* Not added—*moved.* Like someone touched the plate and then adjusted it *perfectly back into place.*

&gt; Someone was *in this room* after the snack was delivered.

And they were **careful**.

No cameras. No wire taps. But someone was watching—testing your presence?

---

**📝 Updated Info:**

- ✅ No lethal traps, no surveillance bugs—this isn’t a kill-box.
- ⚠️ Snack was **handled** post-delivery.
- 🪟 Windows are functional escape points.
- 📜 Plate contains a strange message: “May Fortune Bloom in the Dunes.” (Might be code? Or just cheesy branding.)
- 🍹 You still have your perfect daiquiri.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Leave the snack untouched and start quietly setting up juice-based traps in the room. Defensive prep.}
2. {Take a tiny, test bite of the snack. Just enough to sample. Roll for potential side effects.}
3. {Dump the cactus fruit in the balcony planter. See if anyone comes to check on it.}
4. {Pretend you ate the snack. Arrange the plate like you enjoyed it, then hide in the room and wait.}
5. {Use the time to try contacting Enzo (Marine contact) again—see if he can dig up anything about Room 703 or the phrase “Fortune Bloom in the Dunes.”}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Also jam a stick or something in the window. I need to be able to exfiltrate through there in case there's some sort of remote lockdown.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “Alright. Snack test first. Also let’s not get trapped like a fool.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Cautious Curiosity + Subtle Prepper Paranoia**  
**🎲 Bite Test – Sample the snack (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Kiwi Juice Internal Resistance) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**🎲 Snack Effect Roll – ??? = Result: 3 [Neutral]**  
**🎲 Prep Action – Window Jam Setup (Eatone +2 Clever +1 Resourcefulness) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You taste-test the snack safely *and* rig the window for a clean escape. The suite is now tactically secured.**

---

You stare at the cactus fruit for a long moment, swirling your daiquiri in one hand and gently flexing the fingers on the other. **Too perfect** a snack is always suspicious… but you’re a man of reason. And curiosity.

&gt; “Alright, let’s see what the ‘Cactus Deluxe’ tastes like…”

You pull out your **travel spork**—never leave the island without it—and slice off a sliver of the fruit. It’s… firm. Slightly sticky. The **chocolate smells real**, none of that fake Alabastan sugar-substitute crap. You rest the daiquiri nearby (juice defenses on standby) and take a very **measured** bite.

**Flavor Notes:**
- Tart, like prickly pear.
- Smooth chocolate melt.
- Subtle bitterness on the finish—something herbal, like aloe or crushed sea lavender.

&gt; *Kiwi Juice sensors at rest. No toxin alert. Just… weirdly healthy for a casino treat.*

You wait thirty seconds.

**No burning. No dizziness. No hallucinations of dancing crocodiles.** Just… kind of a *refreshing zing*.

&gt; *They really did just try to impress me with a fancy fruit dessert, huh?*

...Still weird that someone *handled it after delivery,* but the fruit itself seems clean.

---

Then, you get to work on something **far more important: escape engineering.**

You inspect the **window lock**—a vertical sliding pane with a gemstone-crusted handle. Beautiful, but flimsy.

From your pack, you retrieve a **wooden stirring stick** from the daiquiri tray and a **small pair of compact binder clips** from your teacher’s kit. With a few deft motions, you:

- Jam the stick *inside the upper track*, preventing the window from fully sealing even under remote command.
- Use one clip to hold the window just slightly ajar—enough to let juice flow or allow a last-second dive.

Then, as a backup, you discreetly embed a **kiwi juice filament** around the sill—a living humidity sensor. If someone touches the window from outside, you’ll know.

---

**📝 Tactical Status:**

- ✅ Cactus snack: *Safe. Possibly symbolic. May contain mild stimulant herbs.*
- ✅ Window: Now *exfil-ready* — will remain open even if lockdown is triggered.
- 🔔 Kiwi Juice Sensor embedded: alerts you to outside tampering.
- 🛌 Room: Currently secure. Lights dimmed to low. Curtains open, canal lights twinkling.

---

A soft breeze trickles in from the window. The desert air smells clean tonight.

But beneath that peace, you can feel it.

**This place is building toward something.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait in the suite. Hide near the door or balcony and see if anyone comes to “check on you.” Could be revealing.}
2. {Head to the west docks now. You’ve confirmed your suite is safe. Time to chase Yazir’s lead.}
3. {Try to find a service route or employee hallway. Something tells you the real secrets aren’t on the guest floors.}
4. {See if you can make contact with Smoker. Now that you’re stable, you might risk a private note or juice signal.}
5. {Look for your next bounty. Maybe there's someone in Rainbase tied to this mess—and worth tracking.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Well, at least the suite's decent. Let's head back downstairs. Maybe play a few games. I hope they have strip poker (not).

OOC: Where are the relevant characters right now?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option Selected – “Let’s head back downstairs. Kill time, play a few games... definitely not strip poker.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Tourist Mode – Chill Exterior, Sharp Interior | Status: Returning to Casino Floor With Confidence**  
**🎲 Mood Check – Eatone (Relaxed but Ready) = 3 [Fair]**

---

You down the last of your **award-winning daiquiri**, brush off your shirt, and head for the elevator. With the window secured and the snack confirmed *not poisoned*, your suite now feels more like a **safehouse** than a trap.

&gt; “Decent room. Gonna be real mad if this place tries to kill me now.”

The elevator descends slowly, a soft instrumental version of *Jungle P* playing through the speaker in what can only be described as “gondola elevator-core.”  
Ding.

**You’re back on the main floor. The air is thicker now—warmer, louder, and pulsing with a little more tension than earlier.**

**Before we proceed—here’s a snapshot of relevant NPC positions as of now:**

---

### 📍 **Relevant Character Positions in Rainbase / Rain Dinners**

#### 🐊 **Sir Crocodile (Mr. 0)**  
- **Location:** *Private Upper Quarters, Rain Dinners*

#### 📚 **Nico Robin (Miss All Sunday)**  
- **Location:** Unknown, likely in transit between Crocodile’s quarters and inner casino operations

#### 🦌 **Tony Tony Chopper**  
- **Location:** Currently hiding in a **maintenance vent system** that runs behind the aquarium complex  
- **Status:** Monitoring from within—likely saw Smoker as well. Has NOT reported to the rest of the crew yet.  
- **Notes:** He left trace scents you followed earlier. May re-emerge soon if he feels safe.

#### 🍖 **Monkey D. Luffy**  
- **Location:** *Deeper inside Rain Dinners*, separated from group—likely detained, or attempting reckless solo infiltration.  
- **Status:** Unconfirmed. Likely charging headfirst toward danger.  
- **Notes:** Always the wild card.

#### ⚔️ **Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp**  
- **Location:** Separated across guest-accessible and lower levels. **Nami** may have breached VIP access posing as a high-roller.  
- **Status:** Gathering recon, stealth-based.  
- **Notes:** Might cross paths with you soon.

---

### Casino Floor – Now

The floor's packed now: gamblers, dancers, dealers, and the soft croon of an Alabastan jazz trio fill the space. The smell of citrus-scented smoke and fried plantain lingers in the air. The mood is **festive**, but just under the surface: people are watching. Listening. Waiting.

You spot the **main gaming floor** ahead—tables of cards, dice, and wheel games beckoning. There’s even a group of tourists shouting about a **Banana Gator Racing Game** in a corner arena.

No sign of immediate danger. But the night isn’t over yet.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Play a few hands of poker or dice. Blend in. Listen for chatter, maybe overhear something useful.}
2. {Look for Nami—if she’s posing as a high-roller, the VIP poker tables would be a solid lead.}
3. {Try to slip behind the scenes again. There are still secrets below the casino floor.}
4. {Head for the Banana Gator Races. Could be ridiculous fun or a secret front. Possibly both.}
5. {Circle back toward the aquarium. Try to leave a hidden message for Smoker.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I do like me some games. What the heck is Banana Gator racing, anyways?

OOC: I know nothing about the Straw Hats. Following Canon, Will they fall into Crocodile's trap soon? Where's Vivi?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Let’s gamble a little. Also, *what in the name of Oda is Banana Gator racing?*”**  
**🎭 Tone: Curious, Lighthearted, Alert | Action: Blend In, Observe, Enjoy(?)**  
**🎲 Roleplaying Integration Check: (Eatone +1 Fun-Loving +2 Careful) = 4 [Good]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You seamlessly join the crowd, enjoy the show, and gather ambient intel.**

---

You meander past the poker and dice tables with the smooth, casual air of a man trying to look like he’s here for fun and definitely *not* for recon. The **banana-scented smoke**, the **jazzy tunes**, the **soft clack of dice**—it all blends into a strangely relaxing backdrop.

Then you hear it:

&gt; **“AND THEY’RE OFF!!”**

A raucous cheer erupts from a side area beneath an arch marked:  
### 🎯 **“Banana Gator RumbleDome: Rain Dinners' #1 Exotic Spectacle!”**

**You follow the noise** and arrive at an indoor arena—half cocktail lounge, half betting den—with a central tank-like track. Inside? **Six Banana Gators**, each nearly the size of a small car, are fitted with **colorful saddle harnesses and racing numbers**, paddling furiously through a circular watercourse like massive reptilian jet-skis.

Above the track, a flamboyant announcer in a green feather boa is screaming into a golden snail mic:

&gt; “And Number FOUR—*‘Gator-ade’*—takes the lead! Look at those thighs move, folks!! What a powerhouse!”

You blink. It’s **weirdly impressive**. The gators **swim fast**, some even executing surprisingly tight turns. One of them **accidentally launches a splash into the crowd**, soaking a nearby gambler who shouts something about **losing his mortgage on a rigged race**.

There’s even a **betting board**:

- Gator 1 – *Munchie*
- Gator 2 – *Goldfang*
- Gator 3 – *Snack Pack*
- Gator 4 – *Gator-ade*
- Gator 5 – *Seabiscuit*
- Gator 6 – *Uncle Steve*

People are placing bets via **snail terminals** and hooting as gators race around the lazy-river-meets-gladiator-pit course.

&gt; Banana Gator Racing: Where unholy biology meets mid-tier sports entertainment.

You sidle up to the rail, casually sip from your refilled daiquiri (courtesy of a passing tray), and listen in.

---

**🌀 Ambient Chatter Intel (Overheard at the RumbleDome):**

- **&quot;Some blonde woman just won a three million berri hand at the VIP poker table—place went *silent.*&quot;** (*Possibly Nami.*)
- **&quot;I heard they closed the east access corridor—someone saw a *Marine jacket* near the aquarium tunnel.&quot;** (*Smoker alert is spreading.*)
- **&quot;Banana Gator 3's on juice again. Look at the twitching.&quot;**  
- **&quot;Security’s been high-strung tonight. Even the boss hasn’t been seen on the main floor. Usually he makes an appearance...&quot;**

---

**OOC: Canon Update – Vivi &amp; Straw Hats Timeline Context**

You're **not aware** of the Straw Hats' fame, names, or their connection to Alabasta. From your POV, they're just &quot;those weirdos from the alley.&quot;

However, based on *One Piece* canon at this exact point:

- The **Straw Hats** (minus Sanji) will **soon fall into Crocodile’s trap** at Rain Dinners.  
- They’ll be **captured inside the Seastone Cage**, beneath the casino.  
- **Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Vivi** will be imprisoned shortly—Chopper and Sanji will escape this fate and attempt a rescue.
- **Vivi**, at this moment, is **still with the Straw Hats**, possibly sneaking through side corridors trying to either locate King Cobra or intercept Baroque Works agents. She has not been captured *yet*, but she's **in danger**.

You may cross paths with her very soon if you continue exploring the casino floor or VIP zones.

3. {Try to follow up on the east corridor lockdown. Pretend you're &quot;looking for the bathroom.&quot;}
4. {Leave the casino now and check in at the west docks/kebab stand. You’ve gathered some intel and tension’s rising.}
5. {Return briefly to your suite to prepare in case the situation explodes. Lay low, wait for fireworks.}

---

You raise a hand, casual as a cucumber floating in juice.

&gt; “Yeah, I’ll throw 50 on *Snack Pack.* I like juice. I feel a connection.”

You tap it into the **snail betting terminal**, which responds with a chipper *&quot;Beri received! All bets are final! May your gator glide!&quot;* The crowd continues buzzing, eyes locked on the transparent aquatic track as the **second heat** begins.

An announcer bellows through magically-enhanced speakers:

&gt; “LADIES, GENTLEMEN, AND CROCODILE ENTHUSIASTS—HEAT TWO BEGINS IN THREE... TWO... OOOOONE—**CHOMP!!**”

Six Banana Gators surge forward into the circular current like prehistoric torpedoes. They’re **shockingly fast**, their tails propelling them in tight loops around the track as gamblers slam fists and scream numbers.

&gt; “Goldfang’s got an early lead—but WAIT! Snack Pack just took a shortcut inside the current!”

You watch as **Gator #3**—a squat, twitchy banana beast with **a wild gleam in its eye**—**whips into an unexpected slipstream**, launching into second place.

&gt; “Snack Pack is frothing at the snout! That one’s been drinking protein juice and conspiracy theories, folks!”

There’s a moment where it looks like Snack Pack might take the win... but **Uncle Steve**, looking very tired but incredibly focused, **powers through the final corner and edges him out.**

&gt; “AND THAT’S IT—UNCLE STEVE TAKES FIRST! SNACK PACK A CLOSE SECOND! Gator-ade… well, Gator-ade just ate the track divider.”

A few people around you groan. Others cheer.

Your snail terminal chirps again.

&gt; **&quot;Congratulations! You placed 50 Berri on a 2nd Place Finish! You win 100 Berri! Thank you for betting with Rain Dinners!&quot;**

You retrieve your **winnings** in a small, tastefully designed pouch labeled *“HOUSE FAVORITE.”*

  - “Snack Pack’s due for testing. That gator’s not normal.”

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Cash out and casually follow the rumor about the “woman in blue.” Could be Vivi.}

---

You spin on your heel, daiquiri in one hand, a pouch of crisp berri in the other, and slap palms with the first person you see—an elderly man in a frilly sun hat who’s holding a fake crocodile tail as a good luck charm.

&gt; “Let’s gooooooo!”

He cackles in delight.

&gt; “Snack Pack?! You madman, I *knew* someone else had the instincts!”

With the gator arena roaring, you confidently march up to the snail terminal and tap in:

&gt; 💸 **Wager Confirmed: 300 Berri on Gator #3 – Snack Pack**  
&gt; “Snack Pack’s juiced up and ready for redemption.”

The race begins almost immediately—announcer’s voice screaming over the excited crowd:

&gt; “AND THEY’RE OFF! LOOK AT THAT BEAST GO! SNACK PACK IS—IS HE BITING THE *OTHER* GATORS?!”

Indeed, Gator #3 is thrashing through the water like a **green missile** on a sugar bender. He launches past Goldfang, headbutts Munchie, and does a *frighteningly graceful barrel roll* around the final bend.

&gt; “This is madness! This is illegal in three Blue Seas!”

Then—

**He surges forward. Hits the finish line. Leaves waves and a bitten floating saddle behind him.**

The crowd goes *bananas*.

&gt; “AND IT’S SNACK PACK BY A SNOUT! BY A SNOUT!!”

The announcer slams his snail mic on the table and shouts toward the betting booths:

&gt; “SOMEONE GET THAT GATOR A SPA.”

Your terminal glows warmly.

&gt; **&quot;Congratulations, esteemed guest! Your 300 Berri bet on a 1st Place Finish has returned 1,200 Berri. Thank you for believing in Snack Pack™. Your payout will be delivered in gold-stamped token pouches shortly.&quot;**

Two **casino attendants** in crocodile vests approach and hand you a velvet pouch with **gold lettering**.

---

- 🎲 Reputation: You are now noticed by gamblers and staff alike  
- 👀 Eyes are starting to follow you—not suspicious, just... *interested*

---

**Overheard nearby, during the roar of celebration:**

- **“Yo... who’s that guy?”**  
- **“He’s new. Real lucky. Cheng, I think. From the upper floors.”**  
- **“Yeah, but that ain’t just luck. That’s *instinct.*”**  
- **“Watch him. If he wins again, alert the pit boss.”**

And—

&gt; “That woman’s not a metaphor, idiot. She was in blue, with royal earrings. Looked like someone off the Wanted List… but prettier.”

A nearby security guard glances at you briefly… then turns back toward his comm.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Bet again—big win energy. Try to break the house. Might attract… very interesting attention.}

---

&gt; “A thousand. On Snack Pack.”

Silence at the betting booth. The snail terminal almost *glitches*.

The attendant behind the kiosk lowers their sunglasses just enough to make awkward eye contact.

&gt; “Uh... you sure?”

You just smile, casually toss your winning pouch on the counter, and press confirm.

&gt; “That gator is my *spirit animal.* Ride or die.”

The crowd around the Banana Gator RumbleDome has shifted—they’re not just watching the race anymore.

They’re watching **you.**

&gt; “LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A REPEAT GAMBLER—THE HIGH ROLLER OF ROOM 703!  
SNACK PACK'S #1 FAN HAS RETURNED!!”

Spotlights sweep toward you as the arena announcer hypes the crowd. Gamblers throw up signs. Someone actually chants:

&gt; “SNACK-PACK! SNACK-PACK! SNACK-PACK!”

You give a small, confident nod to your elderly high-five friend, who is now holding up two crocodile tails in salute.

---

**THE RACE:**

Snack Pack, now clearly vibrating with **too much banana gator rage** to be healthy, launches from the gate like a **sea cannonball**. He snaps at Goldfang’s tail, flips Uncle Steve **onto the decorative sandbank**, and somehow **surfs on the wake** of another gator for a full quarter lap.

It’s madness.

&gt; “SNACK PACK IS A MONSTER!”  
&gt; “IS HE FLOATING? HE’S FLOATING.”  
&gt; “SWEET MERCIFUL ROGER, HE’S *DOING A VICTORY TWIRL!*”

The crowd explodes. **Snack Pack wins. Again.**  
Not by a snout this time—by **half a lap.**

The announcer throws their boa into the stands and shouts:

&gt; “I have *no idea* what’s in that gator’s veins, but someone get me a towel and a therapist!!”

---

**🏆 YOU WIN — MASSIVELY**

- 💰 Wager: 1,000 Berri  
- 💥 Payout (3:1 odds due to wild behavior): **3,000 Berri**

- 🕵️‍♂️ Security Eyes: On You (Neutral-Alert Status)  
- 🦴 Snack Pack: Clearly going feral with joy. Possibly overfed. Definitely your spiritual mount.

---

**As the crowd erupts, two significant things happen:**

1. A **well-dressed pit boss** in gold-trimmed attire begins making his way toward you. Smiling. But **not smiling with his eyes.**

2. You catch the faintest movement near the **casino’s side corridor**. A flash of **royal blue cloth**, followed by **a silver earring shaped like a royal crest.** The person vanishes down a restricted hallway.

&gt; *Okay. Not a dancer.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Hold court. Accept the pit boss’s attention and see what “congratulations” really means.}
2. {Slip away casually and follow the woman in blue. That wasn’t a dancer. That was royalty.}
3. {Try to get backstage—“My gator’s on fire and I want to feed him personally.” Use your fame as cover.}
4. {Grab the winnings, fake a phone call, and **vanish into the crowd**. Something’s about to shift.}
5. {Buy snacks for the crowd and announce you’ll bet again. Build a following. Use it later.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Waitress! daiquiris for everyone, put it on my tab! I wave magnanimously at the gathered gamblers.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “Daiquiris for *everyone!*”**  
**🎭 Tone: Loud, Generous, Gloriously Distracting | Mood: Riding High on Gator Glory**  
**🎲 Influence Roll – (Eatone +2 Rapport, +2 Current Fame, +1 Juice Aura) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You don’t just win the crowd—you *own* the moment. You are now *a casino folk hero*.**

---

You step forward, raising your daiquiri like **a hero returning from sea**, the crowd still roaring from Snack Pack’s brutal aquatic victory.

&gt; “Waitress!”  
&gt; “**Daiquiris for everyone!** Put it on my tab!”

A collective gasp, followed by a **howl of celebration**, erupts through the Banana Gator RumbleDome. Glasses clink, arms fly in the air, and at least three people start chanting your name incorrectly.

&gt; “*CHUNG! CHUNG! CHUNG!*”  
&gt; “It’s Cheng, you desert raisins!”  
&gt; “CHENG! CHENG! CHENG!”

The waitress gives you a stunned look, then grins and salutes with her tray.

&gt; “Right away, Mr. Cheng!”

Servers scramble into action. Snail bartenders start lining up daiquiris in rapid succession, trays of glowing glasses fanning out like wings of a party god. One woman faints. A man proposes to his date. Another guy starts crying, whispering:

&gt; “That man… that man *believed in Snack Pack.*”

You wave magnanimously, the gold-lettered velvet pouch of your winnings tucked subtly beneath your travel jacket. You’ve created **a perfect social smokescreen**.

The pit boss stops mid-step.

He sees the crowd chanting. The daiquiris flowing. The building momentum of an unscripted legend—and, perhaps wisely, decides now’s *not* the time to crack down on the high roller who’s turned the casino floor into a party zone.

He nods stiffly and pulls back. For now.

---

**📝 Game State Update:**

- 💰 Berri: 4,300  
- 🏷️ Reputation: “*The Juice High Roller of 703*”  
- 🃏 Status: Untouchable (for now) — No one wants to interrupt the guy who just **created an economy of daiquiris**  
- ⚠️ But security is still watching. Smiling. Letting you play. The kind of smile that means *“we’ll remember this.”*

---

**While the daiquiris flow and gators rest, you catch a flash again—**the **woman in blue** slipping behind a false wall near a **“Staff Only” corridor** by the aquarium exit. She’s moving fast now.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now’s your chance. Use the distraction to follow the woman in blue. Everyone’s looking at you—not where you’re going.}
2. {Keep playing the hero. Talk to gamblers, start planting seeds—ask about weird events, Crocodile sightings, or disappearances.}
3. {Approach the pit boss directly. “Got a suite full of gator tokens. Care to comp a bottle of something aged?” Feel him out.}
4. {Disappear. Quietly. Slip back toward the suite or a service hallway while the party shields your exit.}
5. {Take the stage. Make a toast. Build full social dominance. It’s absurd—but it might give you god-tier influence in Rain Dinners.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Keep an eye on that staff only corridor. Good sir, do you have something more... Vintage? I'd like to treat my new friends here, I wave at the crowd.

And snack pack, of course.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected – “A vintage for the people. And the gator.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Gentleman Gambler | Public Image: Benevolent Baron of the Gator Ring**  
**🎲 Social Roll – Charm Offensive (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 High Roller Aura, +1 Crowd Favor) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Pit Boss Resistance – (Cautious +2, Momentarily Overwhelmed -1) = Result: 1 [Average]**  
**✅ Outcome: Success — You gain access to the pit boss’s trust, taste something rare, and keep a close eye on the staff corridor.**

---

The daiquiris are still flowing, the crowd still roaring, and somewhere behind you, **Snack Pack** is attempting to climb out of the tank to receive the affection of his new god.

You turn, just in time to intercept the **pit boss**, whose gold-trimmed suit is sweating with regret. He forces a professional smile as you approach, raising your glass high.

&gt; “Good sir,” you begin smoothly, nodding with the practiced grace of someone who once taught **an etiquette unit to fifteen-year-olds with throwing stars.**  
&gt; “Do you have something more... *vintage*? I’d like to treat my new friends here.”

You gesture dramatically toward the **half-drunken daiquiri horde**, now singing a song that may or may not include the lyrics:

&gt; “HE’S THE JUICE, THE FRUIT, THE CROC-SUIT FLUTE—CHENG!”

Even the pit boss, a man who has probably seen **fire-eaters**, **con men**, and **live octopus auctions**, falters. Then clears his throat.

&gt; “Ahem. Mr. Cheng. Of course. We appreciate a guest with such... festive flair.”

He signals to a passing server and mutters into her ear.

&gt; “Bring the... Mizu Gold ’27.”

&gt; “The entire bottle, sir?” she replies, eyes wide.

&gt; “He just gave away 50 daiquiris and won 3,000 berri betting on a *psychotic reptile*, didn’t he? Yes. The bottle.”

She dashes off, and the pit boss steps closer.

&gt; “I’ve never seen a guest build that kind of... momentum before. If there’s *anything* you need, Mr. Cheng—private lounge, more tokens, even a little extra *luck* on your side...”  
&gt; “Well, we take care of our winners.”

His tone lowers, just slightly. Eyes sharp.

&gt; “But... it’s worth mentioning. Our staff areas are *off-limits.* Just in case you get... *curious.* You understand.”

---

**At the same time—**

Your eyes flick over his shoulder, just as the **“Staff Only” corridor** opens briefly to admit a figure in blue. **Royal blue**, with gold trim. She’s quick, covering her face now. *Definitely not a dancer.*

**Definitely that woman.**

And—**she was carrying something. A satchel. Possibly a map.**

The door seals shut. Unmarked. But you now know **exactly** where it is.

---

**Shortly after—**

The server returns with a **black velvet bottle**, the cork sealed in gold wax.

&gt; **Mizu Gold ’27 – Aged Sparkling Sake from Water 7**  
&gt; “Notes: peach blossom, stonefruit, rare as hell, used in noble ceremonies. Last bottle in Rainbase.”

She pours a single glass. You raise it toward the crowd. They cheer like Snack Pack just got elected King of the Sea.

Snack Pack slaps the tank wall twice in approval.

---

**📝 Updates:**

- 🎖 Influence: Skyrocketed. You’re now considered *casino elite*.  
- 🥂 Beverage Acquired: **Mizu Gold ’27** – you can sip it, use it as leverage, or gift it for max social gain.  
- 🕵️ You know exactly where the **Staff Only corridor** is—and how to reach it if you need to.  
- ⚠️ Pit Boss is friendly… but *watching you closely now.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Excuse yourself with a smile and slip into the staff corridor. The crowd will cover your departure.}
2. {Invite the pit boss to share a glass. See if he lets something slip under the pretense of friendly conversation.}
3. {Keep entertaining. Announce a final bet, then disappear while the floor is cheering again.}
4. {Send the Mizu Gold to Snack Pack. Cause a riot of adoration. Total legend move.}
5. {Feign intoxication, wander near the staff corridor &quot;by accident,&quot; and test the reaction.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Hey, you're part of the crowd too. Have a glass! 

Keep eyeing the staff corridor. Ponder whether I should notify security. Something's going on there.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “C’mon, boss. Even gators need a drink now and then.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Toast with a Smile, Thoughts Behind the Eyes | Dual Action: Social Buy-in + Strategic Observation**  
**🎲 Social Roll – Friendly Toast (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Nobility of Gesture, +1 Juice Aura) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Pit Boss’s Guard – Lowering (Cautious +1, Loosened by Hospitality -2) = -1 [Terrible]**  
**✅ Outcome: He accepts. Starts talking. Your position is secure—but what you’re seeing near the staff corridor is not.**

---

You hold up your crystal glass with just enough flair to look elegant, not pompous. The light catches on the Mizu Gold like **sunlight over a calm sea.**

&gt; “Hey—you’re part of this crowd too. What kind of host would I be if I didn’t raise a glass with the man keeping this show running?”

The pit boss hesitates—**a heartbeat too long**. You’ve seen that moment before, in nervous teachers on parent night. That little flicker of *&quot;am I still in control of this situation?&quot;*

Then, his shoulders drop ever so slightly. He chuckles. Takes the offered glass. Clinks it against yours.

&gt; “To Rain Dinners,” he says.

&gt; “To Snack Pack,” you counter, and the crowd howls with approval.

He sips. You sip. The flavor is exquisite—**stonefruit, dry plum, a breath of cherry blossom**. Expensive, elegant, and old.

&gt; “This stuff was probably brewed when I still had two good knees,” the pit boss mutters.

His tone eases. Eyes crinkle with the first *genuine warmth* you’ve seen. You keep the smile on your face... but your **mind never leaves that corridor**.

---

You glance over, subtle as a dewfall, watching the staff door through reflections in the **casino’s polished decor**. And you notice:

- A **different staff member** stands outside the corridor now. Not in uniform. No name tag. Arms crossed. Not moving.
- Every time someone passes too close, he gently herds them away, like a living velvet rope.
- He’s not watching the crowd. He’s **listening.**

&gt; *Someone’s in there, doing something that needs protection.*

**Should you notify security?**

You consider it.

**On one hand:**
- It’s suspicious.
- She may be trespassing, smuggling, or worse.
- *You’d be doing the “right” thing.*

**On the other hand:**
- If that woman really is **royalty**, or worse, a **rebel**, security might respond violently.
- She could be here to sabotage Crocodile's operations—or expose them.
- And you’re not supposed to know what you know. If you bring attention, *you bring it to yourself too.*

&gt; It’s a gamble, alright. But so is everything in this place.

---

The pit boss glances toward the crowd, then back to you.

&gt; “Y’know... you’d do well in management. You’ve got the... spark.”  
&gt; “Ever think of staying in Rainbase longer than a vacation?”

That *wasn’t* just a compliment.

That was **a probe**.

---

**📝 Updates:**

- 🥂 Pit boss trusts you, now sees you as potential “insider” material.
- 🕵️ You’ve confirmed: someone is guarding that staff corridor. Something important is happening inside.
- ⚖️ You are at a moral crossroad: to report... or to watch.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Keep playing the part. Laugh off the job offer, ask for a “tour of the VIP suites”—use it to steer closer to the staff corridor.}
2. {Say you need a restroom and “get turned around” toward the staff corridor. Test if the guard reacts.}
3. {Take the pit boss aside, mention the corridor, and say “you thought you saw something.” See how he handles the intel.}
4. {Say nothing. Stay and monitor. Watch who enters and exits the corridor next.}
5. {Excuse yourself politely. Head back to your suite, process this over a whiteboard and kiwi juice.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: Per canon, what is happening to the characters of note in this current scene?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **OOC Requested: Canon Character Status – “Rainbase: Just Before the Trap”**  
**Scene Context: You’re in Rain Dinners Casino, just prior to Crocodile’s trap springing on the Straw Hats.**

You're in the thick of one of the most **critical turning points** of the Alabasta arc. Here's where the **main players** are *canonically* at this very moment:

---

### **Straw Hat Pirates**
**Status: Infiltrating Rain Dinners | Minutes from being captured**

- **Luffy**, **Zoro**, **Nami**, **Usopp**, **Vivi**, and **Chopper** have entered Rain Dinners, attempting to locate and confront **Crocodile** directly.
- They are **not yet captured**, but are inside the structure—somewhere beneath the main casino floor.
- Their goal: Stop Operation Utopia by confronting Crocodile, hoping to force a confession or cut off the coup at its head.
- They are **moments away** from falling into the trap—the **Seastone cage beneath the casino**, suspended over a **Banana Gator pit**.
- **Sanji** is not with them. He has remained **outside, unnoticed**, acting as their backup.

---

### **Nefertari Vivi**
**Status: Active | Inside Rain Dinners | Splitting off from group**

- Vivi is traveling with the Straw Hats.
- She is *very likely the woman in blue you just saw.*
- She's likely moving independently from the others at this moment, attempting to locate her father (**King Cobra**) or intercept Baroque Works agents moving toward **Alubarna**.
- Her presence is not publicly known—if she’s recognized, it would instantly trigger a political incident.
- She may be carrying **maps, intel, or the Poneglyph location details**, hoping to disrupt Crocodile’s timing.

---

### **Crocodile (Mr. 0)**
**Status: At the heart of Rain Dinners | In control | Awaiting confirmation of Straw Hats’ capture**

- Currently monitoring events from his **private suite or command chamber** beneath the casino.
- His Seastone trap is ready and soon to be triggered.
- Unaware of **Sanji’s** separate position, but fully expecting the Straw Hats to take the bait.
- Not yet moving personally—waiting for the moment to **deliver his monologue and gloat.**

---

### **Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin)**
**Status: Shadowy presence | Possibly moving between locations**

- Likely aware of the Straw Hats’ presence.
- Possibly aware of **Vivi** moving through the casino.
- She may or may not be coordinating with Crocodile *at this precise moment*—or *secretly watching from afar.*

---

### **Captain Smoker &amp; Tashigi**
**Status: Undercover | Inside Rain Dinners' lower level monitoring corridors**

- Smoker is using internal monitoring systems (visible to you earlier) to **observe Rain Dinners’ operations**.
- He is **intentionally NOT intervening yet**—waiting to catch Crocodile with undeniable evidence of Baroque Works activity.
- Tashigi is likely close by, or recently separated. She may be attempting her own investigation or contacting Marine support.
- Neither are aware of **Sanji** or the full Straw Hat crew’s strategy yet.

### **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**
**Status: Left the casino earlier | May return soon in disguise**

- His orders involve **tracking and intercepting Vivi** using his **Clone-Clone powers**.
- He may reappear at any moment in a different form.
- It is possible he’s already disguised and moving through the building.

---

### **Your Current Position:**
- You are now **socially dominant** on the casino floor—considered a high-rolling guest.
- You are **near the exact corridor** Vivi just entered.
- If you act now, you may **intercept her** before capture or before Crocodile notices she’s broken off from the others.
- Alternatively, you can **let events unfold**, playing the long game while the trap closes around them.

Let me know if you'd like a live timeline or how you’d like to diverge from canon (if at all).

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Hah! Management? You flatter me, no I'm just a humble schoolteacher. I enjoy inspiring kids you know?

I wave at the hooting crowd.

In a way, these are kids too. I raise my drink and yell out a toast to Snack Pack's glory.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Just a humble schoolteacher... who's currently the king of the gator pit.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Heartfelt, Humble, Heroic | Status: Peak Crowd Control**  
**🎲 Toast Roll – (Eatone +2 Rapport, +2 Earnest Charm, +1 Public Standing) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You own the moment completely. You become *Rain Dinners legend*. You buy time, build clout, and steer attention away from Vivi’s corridor.**

---

You give a soft chuckle at the pit boss’s “management” offer, shaking your head like you just got asked to headline the Grand Line’s Got Talent tour.

&gt; “Hah! Management? You flatter me, sir—  
No, I’m just a humble schoolteacher.”

The pit boss raises a brow. You continue, letting your tone shift into something gentle, proud.

&gt; “I enjoy inspiring kids, you know?”

You lift your glass, glancing around the crowd. The gamblers, the servers, the thrill-chasers and deadbeat drifters—some barely older than your students, others emotionally stunted by years of betting slips and lost dreams.

&gt; “In a way... these are kids too.”

And then—**you step onto the raised lip of the Banana Gator tank**, glass held high.

&gt; “TO SNACK PACK!” you bellow, voice cutting through the air like a shining blade of citrus truth.  
&gt; “May his scales always shimmer, and his snack game always stay *juiced!*”

The room erupts.

**Daiquiris fly. Toasts are shouted. Gator tails slap the water in violent agreement. Someone throws confetti. Snack Pack lets out a triumphant grunt and slaps his flipper to the tank wall in perfect synch with your raised glass.**

The pit boss just laughs and takes a long drink of Mizu Gold ’27.

&gt; “You’re something else, Mr. Cheng.”

---

**RESULT:**
- You’ve bought **time**. **Attention is off you**, off the staff corridor, and fixed on your glorious, gator-loving self.
- The **guard at the staff corridor** relaxes slightly. Less tense. Less alert.
- The **pit boss** is now emotionally invested in your narrative. He won’t act against you unless absolutely necessary.
- You’ve secured your role as **casino royalty**—a local legend, a mysterious teacher, a high-rolling gambler who drinks like a noble and bets like a fool.

---

**Your options are now even wider than before. What you do next may determine how deeply you get involved in Vivi’s fate… or Crocodile’s downfall.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {While the crowd celebrates, slip into the staff corridor after Vivi. No one will notice now.}
2. {Keep playing the high roller—start asking about “rare guests,” “closed corridors,” or anything involving the royal family.}
3. {Excuse yourself quietly and send a message to Smoker via Kiwi Juice. “Something’s going down. Woman in blue.”}
4. {Find a quiet spot to follow Vivi’s trail more subtly—perhaps even use your fruit to sense water trail residue.}
5. {Invite the pit boss to a drink in your suite. See what kind of dirt he spills behind closed doors.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - excuse myself, say I need to use the gentlemen's room. Look for Smoker (or maybe bump into Tashigi)

OOC: I know of Smoker from the news, but not Tashigi.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected – “Excuse me, nature calls… also, time to find a chain-smoking Marine.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Polite Disengagement + Covert Intent | Status: VIP Free Roaming Access**  
**🎲 Social Disengage Roll – (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Party Credit, +1 Pit Boss Favor) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Search Roll – (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Knowledge of Smoker’s Habits, +1 Devil Fruit Juice Sense) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You disengage smoothly and head toward the aquarium corridors. You do not find Smoker… but you *do* find Tashigi.**

---

You clink your glass with the pit boss one last time and offer a perfectly-timed, totally-believable out:

&gt; “Excuse me, sir—must make a quick stop at the gentlemen’s room. All these daiquiris, you know.”

He chuckles, gestures lazily with his glass.

&gt; “Don’t fall in. And tell Snack Pack I said hi.”

You slip through the crowd like a sand eel, nodding at smiling patrons as you meander toward the **aquarium wing**—where you first glimpsed Smoker earlier. You pass the regular restrooms, but your focus isn’t on porcelain thrones.

It’s on **finding the Marine ghost watching this place from the shadows.**

---

### 🧃 Kiwi Juice Sense Activated – Micro-moisture Tracking  
- You let a light mist of your Devil Fruit’s juice trail around your collarbone and earlobes—*tuned for tobacco tang and high body heat.*
- You catch a faint, lingering humidity signature… then something fresher: **polished metal**, **warm footsteps**, **sword oil**.

You round a corner into a **dim corridor behind the aquarium’s service tanks**, where the neon lights fade into cold blue, and tourists aren’t allowed.

And there—**you nearly collide with her**.

---

### **You have encountered: Tashigi**  
- **Marine Lieutenant (Junior Grade)**  
- Wearing a brown officer’s coat and sword strapped at her hip.  
- Glasses slightly askew.  
- Currently holding a **Den Den Mushi in one hand**, pacing, whispering—unaware of you until the very last moment.

She spins as you round the corner, instantly dropping into a **low-ready combat stance**, sword half-drawn.

&gt; “Stay back!” she snaps.  
&gt; “This hallway is off-limits—show me your identification! Who are you?!”

---

**OOC Notes:**
- Your character **does not know her by name**, only recognizes **the Marine insignia and swordsmanship posture**.
- She is **not currently aggressive**, just defensive—caught off guard mid-investigation.
- You still have your **“Cheng, VIP Room 703” identity** if you want to play dumb—or come clean.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {&quot;Whoa, whoa—VIP guest! Cheng. I got turned around looking for the bathroom. Honest mistake.&quot; Keep cover.}
2. {&quot;I’m Eatone. I’m a teacher and freelance bounty hunter. I know who your boss is. I think we’re on the same side here.&quot; Break cover.}
3. {Use your Devil Fruit to send a juice-thread message around the corner: “Straw Hats. Vivi. East corridor. Rain Dinners trap.”}
4. {Play confused, stall, and see if she’ll slip intel. “What’s going on here, anyway?”}
5. {Backpedal fast and vanish. You didn’t get caught. Don’t blow your position yet.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Whoa, holy shit, lady! Easy on the sword! Back off, Nearly spill my drink in the process. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Whoa! Holy shit, lady!”**  
**🎭 Tone: Alarmed Tourist + Clumsy VIP | Cover Identity: Fully Maintained (Cheng, Room 703)**  
**🎲 Bluff Roll – (Eatone +2 Performance, +1 Plausible Distraction, +1 Drink As Prop) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Suspicion Roll – (+2 Protocol, -2 Flustered) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: SUCCESS — Tashigi stands down, realizes you’re not a threat, and apologizes while staying wary.**

---

You throw your free hand up as you **stumble back dramatically**, daiquiri sloshing in your grip like a tiny tidal wave of alcohol-based innocence.

&gt; “**Whoa—holy shit, lady!** Easy on the sword!”  
&gt; “I’m just—*I’m just trying to find the bathroom!*”

You **nearly spill the Mizu Gold**, managing to save it only by **tilting your wrist at the last second** like a seasoned juice handler.

The blue light glints off your glass. You widen your eyes. Throw in a little breathy panic. The full package.

Tashigi freezes.

&gt; “I—oh.”  
&gt; “I thought—dammit.”  
&gt; She pushes her glasses up, cheeks coloring with embarrassment.

&gt; “Sorry. Sorry. You’re—one of the VIPs?”

&gt; “Room 703,” you mutter, shaking your head, “and I am **not** paid enough to get impaled in the dark by a Marine. I teach kids. I’m on vacation. I drink daiquiris and bet on gators.”

She lowers the sword, still frowning, but clearly rattled.

&gt; “Right. Sorry again. We’ve had… security issues. There’s been movement through the staff corridors, unauthorized agents, and possibly infiltrated personnel. I thought you were—”

She stops herself. You see her mentally slam the brakes.

&gt; “Never mind. It’s classified.”

---

She steps aside, eyes still flicking toward her Den Den Mushi as it hums silently in standby.

You notice her coat isn’t fully buttoned. There’s a **Marine logbook** half-tucked into her pocket, and the hilt of her sword is freshly oiled. **She’s in the middle of something**, but your harmless act just bought you a conversation—*if you want it.*

---

**Tashigi – Current Mood: Flustered | Wary | Apologetic**  
**You – Still Cheng, VIP, Daquiri King**  
**Environment – Dim corridor near aquarium systems, no civilians nearby**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {&quot;Look, I won’t ask about your mission… but you just confirmed there is one. Tell me—should I get out of here?&quot;}
2. {&quot;Okay, okay. But if you’re dealing with infiltration… I might’ve seen something.” Offer vague tip about the blue-cloaked woman.}
3. {&quot;Hey, are you working with that white-haired guy? Smokes two cigars? Looked like a government guy.&quot; Feel her out.}
4. {Apologize again, bow out, and disappear toward the staff corridor before she regains her edge.}
5. {&quot;No worries. Just... maybe next time don’t draw steel near the guy holding vintage sake.&quot; Play it off, lighten the mood, try to chat more.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - You, you're a marine right? I was going to tell casino security, but they're giving me the creeps. I saw a blue haired woman sneaking into the staff only corridor near the bananagator racing pens. Pretty sure she wasn't staff.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “Yeah, I was gonna tell security—but you don’t have that look.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Reluctant Informant + Bounty Hunter Instincts | Credibility Boosted by Prior Bluff**  
**🎲 Truth Drop Roll – (Eatone +2 Sincerity, +1 Observational Accuracy, +1 Marine Recognition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi's Reaction – (+2 Professionalism, -1 Guilt from Overreaction, +1 Cross-Referencing) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: Strong Success — You’re believed instantly. Tashigi refocuses and reacts decisively.**

---

You lower your voice and glance over your shoulder, like someone **used to carrying secrets** but not enjoying it.

&gt; “You, you’re a Marine, right?”

Tashigi nods once, still catching her breath.

&gt; “I was gonna tell casino security about something weird I saw. But honestly?”  
&gt; “They’re giving me the creeps. Like they’re smiling with teeth too sharp.”

Her eyes sharpen. You continue, clear, careful.

&gt; “There was a **blue-haired woman**. Slipped through a **staff-only door** near the **Banana Gator pens**—not wearing a uniform, not acting like she belonged. Carried something under her arm, maybe a satchel or a case. Real fast. Real quiet.”

You don’t embellish. Just deliver the truth, plain and clean.

Tashigi blinks.

Then she **snaps into motion**.

&gt; “What direction exactly?”  
&gt; “What color was the satchel? Blue—navy blue? Black? Did she have earrings? Anything else?”

She’s in **investigator mode now**—replaying intel in her head.

&gt; “Blue hair, possible royal signature…” she mutters to herself.  
&gt; “It can’t be... but if it is—she’s here, then the Straw Hats—”

She stops, realizing she’s almost talking out loud.

&gt; “You did the right thing. I’m... sorry for earlier. You’re not the only one caught up in something bigger.”

She glances back down the hallway, then curses under her breath.

&gt; “Listen—if you see *anyone* in a white suit with a golden crocodile pin acting like they don’t blink—avoid them.  
They don’t answer to this casino.”

Then she taps the Den Den Mushi in her hand.

&gt; “Captain,” she murmurs, voice low. “Possible ID on the princess. I’m going after her.  
If I don’t check in in five minutes, assume contact has been made.”

She clicks it shut and turns to you, serious now.

&gt; “Cheng, right? Stay in the public spaces. Whatever’s going on, you don’t want to be in the splash zone.”

---

**📝 INFO GAINED:**

- Tashigi **believes you completely.**
- The woman you saw *is likely Nefertari Vivi.*
- Tashigi is **now in pursuit** of her and possibly the Straw Hats.
- The **“white suit, gold crocodile pin” staffers** are *not* casino employees—likely Baroque Works elite.
- Smoker is listening. And now he knows **you’re involved**, even if you didn’t say your real name.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Say nothing, let her go—but quietly follow. You’re invested now, and this is bigger than gambling.}
2. {Head back to the casino. You’ve done your part—time to lay low and pretend to be the juice-sipping VIP again.}
3. {Contact Enzo again. Report that Marines are in play, Crocodile’s crew is posing as staff, and that Vivi may be here.}
4. {Slip toward the staff door while Tashigi’s focused. You might find more before she does.}
5. {Turn and leave—but leave behind a juice marker. If she gets into trouble, you’ll know.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - excuse me, Ma'am?

I pull out my bounty hunter's license. 

Independent hunter, Eatone Cheng. There's something off today, and I'm worried about you wandering into what might be the lion's den by yourself. Would you like assistance?

OOC: Tashigi is prideful, may turn down support. Also might see it as a slight since she's a woman.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Excuse me, Ma’am… I might not be a Marine, but I’ve got juice.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Earnest, Respectful, Subtly Protective | Playing the Card: Licensed Bounty Hunter Offer**  
**🎲 Diplomacy Roll – (Eatone +2 Sincerity, +1 Professionalism, +1 Risk Framing) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Pride Filter – (+2 Independent Streak, -1 Acknowledging Real Danger, +1 Respect for Proper Procedure) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**🎯 Outcome: SUCCESS — She turns you down… but doesn’t dismiss you. You’ve earned her respect.**

---

She’s halfway down the hallway when you call out—calm, respectful.

&gt; “Excuse me, Ma’am?”

She halts, turning on a dime. You step closer, not too close, and reach into your inner coat pocket—not the side with the baton.

You produce a thin **denim-bound wallet**, flipping it open to reveal your **Bounty Hunter’s License**—stamped, registered, **Grand Line Certified**, complete with your signature and the slightly faded watermark of a Kiwi slice in the corner.

&gt; “Name’s **Eatone Cheng**. Independent hunter. When I’m not teaching kids how not to fall into desert heatstroke, I do field work.”

You slide the license back into your coat.

&gt; “There’s something *off* about tonight. The staff, the setups, the *way it feels like the whole place is waiting to snap.*”

Your tone remains even. Not challenging. Just... honest.

&gt; “And I know you’re a Marine. Probably above my pay grade.  
But I’m offering. If you want a second pair of eyes—not as a bodyguard, not because you’re a woman—but because **I’ve seen lion dens before**... and this smells like one.”

For a moment, Tashigi says nothing. Just studies you.

Her expression flickers: pride, frustration, something close to gratitude—but locked tight behind that Marine posture.

She adjusts her glasses. Steps forward.

&gt; “You’re good,” she says quietly. “You’re *too* good. If I were any other agent, I might’ve pulled you in already.”

Then—she reaches into her coat and flashes her own ID:  
**Lt. Tashigi, Marine Intelligence, Captain Smoker’s Office.**

&gt; “And *I* walk into lions’ dens because sometimes there’s cubs inside. Innocents.”  
&gt; “So… no. I can’t accept your help. Officially.”

A pause. Then, softer:

&gt; “But... if I don’t come back through that hallway in ten minutes, Cheng... well... do what bounty hunters do.”

She pivots, strides away, and vanishes into the corridor, sword gleaming in the pale blue light.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- You are now known by name to **Tashigi**.
- She respects you—even if she can’t take you with her.
- She’s walking into the unknown, and she knows it.
- You are now her **unofficial backup**.
- Smoker likely knows your name by now through her channel.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait. Ten minutes. If she doesn’t come back, follow her trail.}
2. {Mark the hallway with juice—if she runs, you’ll trace the splash. Then return to the casino floor casually.}
3. {Head to the suite. Prep. Juice-armor, traps, a map. You might be going in after her.}
4. {Go to the staff corridor now. Quietly. Carefully. If it’s bad, she’ll need help faster than ten minutes.}
5. {Contact Enzo again. You have a name, a title, and a possible warlord’s base of operations.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Return to the Bananagator pens, near the corridor. Ready to respond in 10 minutes. Or if I hear explosions.

Wave to the crowd as I return, and clink glasses with my newfound friends.

Observe. What did the guard next to the corridor do when Tashigi approached?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Ten-minute countdown. If there’s screaming, I’m sprinting.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Watchful Guest | Internal Readiness: Battle-On-A-Hair-Trigger**  
**🎲 Stealth Return Roll – (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Social Camouflage, +1 Route Familiarity) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Observation Roll – (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Juice-Sense, +1 Experience Watching Shady Adults at School Events) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: You return unnoticed, perfectly reintegrate into the crowd, and *notice everything.*

---

You wait ten seconds after Tashigi disappears—*just enough time to let the quiet hang like a held breath.*

Then, you turn and **casually retrace your path** back toward the casino floor, daiquiri still in hand, stride even, gaze soft. No one gives you a second look. **You’re Cheng. The daiquiri king. Gator god. Room 703.**

As you step through the archway into the familiar chaos of the **Banana Gator RumbleDome**, the crowd is still riding the high of your last toast. The servers have brought out **free snack trays** in your honor. Someone’s fashioned a **Snack Pack mask out of cocktail napkins**.

&gt; “Heyyy, he’s back!”  
&gt; “CHENG! GATOR KING!”

You wave, grin, and clink glasses with two enthusiastic fans—one wearing a gator tail hat, the other just **vibing way too hard to flute jazz.**

You gently **steer yourself to a small table** near the arena’s edge—specifically, one with **full line-of-sight** to the **Staff Only corridor**.

---

### **Your Eyes Lock On the Guard**

He’s still there.  
Same stance.  
Still looking too neutral.  
Still wearing no name tag.  
Still pretending to be invisible—but standing **like someone trained to fight.**

But here’s what you **saw earlier**, now with fresh clarity:

&gt; When Tashigi approached the corridor…  
&gt; **He didn’t stop her.**  
&gt; He *didn’t even move.*  
&gt; No hand to a comm, no “may I help you,” no nothing.

He saw her coming. Saw the **Marine coat**, saw the **sword**, saw the **clearly non-tourist** energy—and chose to look away.

&gt; Which means either:
- He didn’t recognize her and is criminally undertrained (unlikely).
- He **was told to let her pass**.
- Or **he was told not to interfere with anyone “official looking.”**

You also notice: the **door she went through hasn't opened since.**

---

**📝 Time Check:**

- Tashigi went in **less than two minutes ago**.
- You are seated, fully reabsorbed into the crowd.
- The corridor is still quiet. Still guarded. Still *wrong.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait the full ten minutes. No action unless you hear something. Let the plan play out.}
2. {Start a distraction if needed—something to make the guard abandon post or react. Could be a false “Gator Emergency.”}
3. {Leave a Kiwi juice trail from the corridor into the hallway, so you can follow it faster later. Subtle prep.}
4. {Approach the guard under the guise of casual conversation. Feel him out—see if he’s Baroque Works.}
5. {Use one of your new fans. Convince them to ask the guard “where the VIP restroom is” as a probe.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - I offer the guard a drink. Hey, from one working man to another, appreciate you keeping us safe.

OOC: I know nothing about Baroque works

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 4 Selected – “Hey, man. Just keeping the vibes alive.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Friendly Guest | No Suspicion, Just Politeness | Hidden Probe Under Cover of Kindness**  
**🎲 Social Approach Roll – (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 High Roller Aura, +1 No Suspicion of Baroque Works) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Guard’s Reaction – (Trained +2, But Not Expecting Kindness -1) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: You disarm him with charm. He remains professional, but lets a *few things* slip.**

---

You swirl the last inch of your daiquiri and walk toward the corridor casually, like you’re just stretching your legs before betting another thousand on your semi-possessed gator.

The guard doesn’t react as you approach. Doesn’t twitch, doesn’t flinch. Just watches you with the same **calm stare you’ve seen on exasperated substitute teachers** trying to grade essays during a school fire drill.

You stop beside him—just enough distance not to crowd.

&gt; “Hey,” you say lightly.  
&gt; “From one working man to another—appreciate you keeping us safe out here.”

You offer the drink—not aggressively. Just... a friendly gesture from a guy with extra vintage and too much attention.

For a moment, he says nothing.

Then:

&gt; “Appreciate that, sir. But I don’t drink on post.”

His voice is polite. Neutral. But you catch the **slight pause before “sir.”** Like he’s choosing that word carefully. Like he’s trained to.

He nods toward the tank, where **Snack Pack** is now getting a shoulder massage from an arena handler.

&gt; “You’ve got the floor lit up tonight. Don’t see many people treat staff with respect like that.”

You keep the conversation casual.

&gt; “Eh, it’s just a vacation for me. School’s out. Nice room, good drinks, freakishly athletic reptiles. What’s not to love?”

A tiny smile flickers across his face. You decide to test the waters.

&gt; “So what’s back there, anyway?” you nod at the staff corridor.  
&gt; “Employee lounge? Secret slot machines? Gator nap room?”

His response is **quick**, smooth—but *too rehearsed*.

&gt; “Just back-of-house logistics, sir. Tank access, kitchen intake, maintenance. Nothing for guests.”

&gt; “Mmh.” You take a sip.  
&gt; “Saw someone go in earlier. Long blue hair. Didn’t look like staff.”

&gt; “...Probably security clearance. Some VIPs bring personal assistants. Escorts. Stylists.”

Another smooth lie. But now you’re listening closer.

He shifts his stance slightly, hand resting near his hip—not threateningly, just **habitually**, like there's something holstered there.

**Not a weapon. A Den Den Mushi. A communicator.**

---

**📝 What You’ve Learned:**

- He’s **not a casino employee**. Too rigid. Too professional.  
- He **recognized Tashigi as someone important**—but let her through without orders.
- The corridor leads to **more than just kitchens.** Possibly **Rain Dinners' internal control zone**.
- He's not aggressive. You aren't considered a threat. But if you were *suspicious*, he’d likely act fast.
- You're **earning trust**—and that means opportunity.

---

**Time Check: 4 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Corridor: Quiet. Door: Still Closed.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Continue the small talk. See if you can get his name, origin, or slip about his *real* employer.}
2. {Ask him what he thinks of the guy in charge here—“Croco? I heard he’s a war hero or something?” See how he reacts.}
3. {Leave a tiny juice marker on his coat hem or boot. If he moves, you’ll know.}
4. {Return to your table. Let him forget you. Watch for movement.}
5. {Ask if staff ever let VIP guests tour the “logistics” area. Play dumb. Maybe get an invite.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Hey, how about I get you a drink when you get off shift then? I'm sure you've got stories to share. I know I do.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “I’ll toast you later, friend. Off the clock.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Charismatic, Disarming, *Strategic Friendship Offer***  
**🎲 Social Roll – (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Casual Trust Offer, +1 ‘Not Threatening’ Aura) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Guard’s Response Roll – (Trained +1, Socially Underequipped -1) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: You catch him off guard, ease his stance, and learn just enough to confirm your instincts.**

---

You lean slightly closer—not menacing, just friendly—and lift your now-empty glass in a mock toast.

&gt; “Hey, how about I get you a drink when you’re off shift?  
I’m sure you’ve got some stories, yeah? Places like this... always have stories.”  
&gt; “I know I do.”

There’s a pause.

You expect a polite brush-off. But instead, his jaw shifts like someone grinding down a reflex.

&gt; “...Heh. I’ll think about it, sir.”

He glances over at the crowd—still laughing, drinking, roaring as **Snack Pack body-slams a floaty gator toy** in an unprompted aquatic display of dominance.

&gt; “Could probably use one. This place ain’t exactly quiet lately.”

He catches himself and straightens. Looks away, neutral again—but too late.

That one little comment?  
**He let something slip.**

And he knows it.

You keep it cool, just smiling.

&gt; “I’ll be around. Cheng. Room 703.”  
&gt; “Look me up after clock-out.”

He doesn’t answer—but he doesn’t say no. You walk away casually, returning to your spot, **a little richer in trust and intel.**

---

**📝 What You Gained:**

- The guard has accepted you as **socially safe.** You're no longer just a guest—you’re a “harmless regular.”
- He **confirmed instability behind the scenes** without meaning to. “Place ain’t quiet lately” = pressure is building.
- He’s on edge, but warming up. Might talk more *off shift*—a potential ally or leak later.
- Still never gave his name. That’s deliberate.

**Time Check: 6 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Corridor: Still Quiet**  
**Guard: Relaxed, but alert. Eyes follow movement, especially VIPs.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Return to the bar. Prep to leave. If she doesn’t come out soon… she might *not.*}
2. {Wait at your table. Eyes on the door. Two more minutes, then you act.}
3. {Create a distraction—shouting match, a staged banana spill, something to pull the guard’s focus if you need a fast move.}
4. {Find one of the floor servers you tipped earlier. Quietly ask if there’s another way into staff areas.}
5. {Send a trickle of juice beneath the corridor door. Just enough to scout. No combat—just surveillance.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Hey! When's the next race? Snack Pack craves blood! And wins! Mostly blood!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected – “Snack Pack hungers for glory… and maybe a little bit of gator spleen.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Over-the-Top Gambler Energy | Intent: Crowd Distraction + Guard Misdirection**  
**🎲 Distraction Roll – (Eatone +2 Performance, +2 Public Momentum, +1 Gator Fandom Cult Leader Status) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You create a full-scale crowd frenzy. Security attention shifts. The guard is momentarily compromised.**

---

You throw your arms up like a preacher channeling divine revelation through a tropical cocktail.

&gt; “**HEY!**” you shout across the Gator RumbleDome.  
&gt; “When’s the **next race?!** My boy **Snack Pack** craves **blood and glory**!  
AND WINS! MOSTLY BLOOD!!”

The crowd **explodes.**  
Drinks slosh. Someone yells, “**Snack Pack for the Shichibukai!**”  
Another patron whips off their shirt and slaps it onto the tank glass like a banner of war.

The announcer—clearly still recovering from the last round—fumbles the golden snail mic:

&gt; “U-UH—THE NEXT RACE BEGINS IN… TEN MINUTES! SPECIAL EXHIBITION ROUND!”  
&gt; “REPEAT: SNACK PACK WILL RACE—AGAINST THREE CHALLENGERS!”

A **bell rings**, unprompted. Staff scramble. **Spotlights spin.**  
The crowd swells toward the arena edge, everyone jostling for position, drunk on juice, booze, and Snack Pack fever.

---

### **What Happens to the Guard:**

Your antics draw **every eye in the vicinity**, including his.

He turns his head.  
**Just a second too long.**

You see him reach for his Den Den Mushi—*maybe to report, maybe to listen in*—but it doesn’t matter.

&gt; He’s distracted.  
&gt; The corridor? **Unguarded. For the moment.**

---

**Time Check: 8 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Crowd Status: Frenzied, Screaming for Gator Blood**  
**Corridor Status: Unwatched, Unlocked, Wide Open**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Slip into the corridor. Quiet, quick, just far enough to find Tashigi—or what’s left of her.}
2. {Send a thread of juice beneath the door while everyone’s distracted. Stealth recon.}
3. {Use your popularity to bluff deeper: “As Snack Pack’s sponsor, I demand a backstage tour!”}
4. {Wait two more minutes. Tashigi said ten. Don’t break the deal—yet.}
5. {Prep a juice escape route. Just in case you need to run—or fight—soon.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - 8 minutes ain't 10, but it ain't 0 either. Let's take a look. Leave a kiwi trail behind me for sensing and exfil.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “8 ain’t 10... but it ain’t nothin’. Let’s move.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Covert, Focused, Professionally Cautious**  
**🧃 Devil Fruit Usage: Kiuikyuui Jūsu Jūsu no Mi – Trail Activated (Passive Sensing + Escape Route)**  
**🎲 Stealth Roll – (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Distraction Field, +1 Juice Control) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You slip into the staff corridor completely unseen, trail in place. You are now in enemy space.**

---

The crowd continues **roaring Snack Pack’s name** like they’re about to vote him into Parliament. Drinks are flying. Security’s preoccupied with **not getting trampled** by people throwing money at the betting terminals.

You slide toward the **Staff Only door**, still cracked slightly from earlier. The guard’s gaze is locked on the announcer booth—he doesn’t see you vanish inside.

With a subtle **snap of your fingers**, a thin trail of **kiwi juice threads from your heel**, back across the tile, glowing faintly only to you. It anchors to the base of a cleaning cart, where it will pulse softly if tugged from either side.

&gt; *Safety line secured. Teacher tactics engaged.*

---

**INTERIOR: Staff Corridor – Sublevel 1 Access Passage**  
- **Lighting:** Dim. Yellow halogen bulbs flickering occasionally.  
- **Sound:** Dripping pipes, faint hum of machinery, distant murmur of an aquarium pump.  
- **Smell:** Salt, oil, and faint antiseptic. Someone tried to cover up blood recently. Not very well.

The corridor stretches ahead, descending in a **gentle slope**—clearly designed for utility carts and maintenance access. Pipes line the walls. Security signs warn about **“AUTHORIZED STAFF ONLY – Surveillance Active.”**

You pass:

- A **locked supply room**  
- A **laundry intake chute**  
- A **maintenance panel** with fingerprints on it—recent.  
- And then... the **first real sign**:

### A scuff on the floor—**boot tread**, thin, regulation heel.

**Tashigi’s trail.**

You follow, careful to keep your footfalls light. Every corner, you leave a fresh **sensing droplet** of kiwi juice, keeping a **light mental tether** to their location. You’re maybe 25 meters in when you hear it:

&gt; **A grunt.**  
&gt; **Soft metal against concrete.**

You ease to the corner. Ahead is a **fork in the hallway**—one side leads to **central filtration** for the aquarium. The other toward **what looks like an elevator chamber**, its keypad **still flickering from recent input.**

And there—**on the floor near the filtration doorway**—you see her:

&gt; **Tashigi, crouched. Alive. Breathing hard. Bleeding from her temple. Sword half-drawn.**  
&gt; Her back is to the wall. Across from her lies the **unmoving body of a man in a casino staff uniform**—his coat open just enough to show a **Baroque Works tattoo on his ribs.**

She hasn’t seen you yet. But she’s **not unconscious**. She’s waiting. **Cornered?** Laying a trap?

---

**📝 Current Situation:**

- You are **25 meters into the staff corridor**, unseen.  
- **Kiwi trail active** for exfil or reinforcements.  
- **Tashigi is down but conscious**, recovering from a fight.  
- One **Baroque Works agent down**—unknown if dead.  
- You are **not yet engaged.** Full element of surprise.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Approach and identify yourself quietly. “Cheng. I followed. You okay?”}
2. {Stay hidden. Watch her for another 30 seconds. Maybe she’s not alone.}
3. {Prepare a juice shield in advance. Enter visibly, but protected.}
4. {Check the Baroque Works agent first—see if he’s dead or faking.}
5. {Retreat slightly. Juice-mark this chamber. Tashigi’s alive. Time to get backup or go deeper.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 / 3. Lay in the shadows, but start accumulating kiwi juice in one hand, and draw my baton (unextended) in the other. Who knows what might happen.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2/3 Hybrid Selected – “Stay low. Stay hidden. Juice in one hand. Baton in the other.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Predator’s Patience | Internal: Fully Alert, Expecting Ambush**  
**🎲 Stealth Hold Roll – (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Cautious Prep) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Juice Pooling Roll – (Eatone +1 Control, +1 Prepared Terrain, +1 Devil Fruit Focus) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Passive Perception Roll – (Eatone +2 Juice-Sense, +1 Combat Instinct) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: You're hidden, fully prepared, and you spot the threat *before it strikes.***

---

You slip into the shadows near a low **utility pipe** that runs along the ceiling drop—crouched just behind a rusted **ventilation grate**, vision perfect for this stretch of hallway. You let out a slow breath, calming your pulse, just like during *those “parent-teacher meetings” where the angry dads smelled like whiskey and poor choices.*

You extend your **left hand** just slightly, palm down, and begin pooling a tight, coiled orb of **high-density kiwi juice**, each drop refined and precise. A pale green glow begins to shimmer under your palm, like **liquid courage under moonlight.**

Your **right hand** slips to your baton—still collapsed, but Seastone tip ready to snap open with a flick. The grip is worn smooth from handling, like the edge of a desk you’ve rapped for silence a hundred times.

&gt; *Juice for shield or trap. Baton for things that don’t respond to juice.*

You watch Tashigi from the shadows. She **hasn’t seen you.**  
She’s breathing steadily now. Her head turns, slowly scanning. She knows someone else *might* be nearby.

That’s when your **juice-sense flares.**

Not from her. Not from the body.

&gt; From **above.**

Your breath catches.

The ceiling panel **three meters behind her**—one of the vent ducts—is **open.** Just slightly. **Condensation trails**—thin trickles of moisture out of place in the dry desert air—slither down the edge.

You hold your breath and shift your focus.

### There’s someone **in the ceiling.**

Alive. Silent. Moving slow. Maybe **waiting to strike.** Maybe **already watching her.** Maybe **watching you.**

**You see a flash of black boot leather.**

Tashigi hasn't noticed. She's vulnerable.

You? You’re **armed. Primed. Hidden.**  
And the air is getting **very, very still.**

---

**📝 Tactical Summary:**

- You are **completely hidden.**  
- You have **a prepared ball of kiwi juice** (choice of shield, trap, or directed strike).  
- You have your **collapsed Seastone baton** in hand.  
- Tashigi is unaware of the ceiling threat.  
- You have **the jump. One clean action before they move.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Hurl the juice upward into the vent. Flush them out. Strike first.}
2. {Extend the baton *quietly*, prep for a physical ambush. Wait until they drop.}
3. {Use the juice to *trap the vent exit*, sealing them in with an adhesive flood.}
4. {Hiss softly: “Marine—above you.” Alert Tashigi. Lose surprise, gain ally readiness.}
5. {Split the juice—some into the vent, some into a wall trail to *listen* for movement inside. Buy yourself info.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Prime my juice hand, ready to launch a juicy surprise at whatever comes out of the ceiling.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Let 'em drop. I’ve got a juice-packed surprise with their name on it.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Silent Readiness | Stance: Predator in the Dark**  
**🎲 Held Action – Juice Launch (Eatone +1 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Prepared Strike, +1 Surprise) = *Primed, Ready to Release***  
**🎲 Environmental Check – Ceiling Panel Stability = Result: Loose. Unsecured.**  
**🎲 Enemy Stealth Roll – (+2 Trained, -2 Moisture Signature) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: You’ve readied a perfect ambush. You’re one move ahead. And they’re about to drop into your strike zone.**

---

Your muscles coil with the stillness of a veteran field exam proctor who’s just spotted the kid with a cheat sheet under the desk.

You don’t move—not a flinch, not a breath.  
Your **juice orb grows**, dense and slightly steaming in your palm. You concentrate it down to a **tight, pulsing bundle** of semi-solid kiwi pressure. Thick with **natural acids and sticky fruit pulp**, it’s ideal for one thing:

&gt; *Neutralizing targets without killing them. Unless they’re allergic. In which case—oops.*

The air shifts.

The ceiling panel just above and behind Tashigi **creaks.**  
One **black-gloved hand** appears, gripping the edge. **Silent. Deliberate.**

Then a second hand.  
Then—**a masked face.**

White mask. Gold trim.  
A **Baroque Works elite agent.** You still don’t know what that means… but it **sure as hell ain’t a stylist.**

He moves with care—likely thinks Tashigi’s too disoriented to detect him.

&gt; But he doesn’t know *you’re here.*

You see it:

- His **knife is drawn**.  
- He’s about to drop onto her with **deadly precision.**  
- He's **three seconds from committing to the kill.**

---

**You may now release your held action.**

Choose how to launch the juice:

1. {Direct shot to the face – blind, sting, disorient. Disable immediately.}  
2. {Blast his hands – knock the knife loose, force him to fall unarmed.}  
3. {Spray the vent – cover the exit and seal it. Trap him before he drops.}  
4. {Launch upward and trigger a sticky *shockwave* in the vent. Flush him out hard.}  
5. {Let him fall. Hit him the *moment* he lands—less risk to ceiling, more drama.}

🌀 {Choose how you unleash the juice.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Kiwi away! Draw my baton and move in.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Kiwi Away!”**  
**Action: Direct Strike to the Face | Follow-Up: Close Quarters Engagement**  
**🎲 Attack Roll – (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Aim, +1 Surprise, +1 Close Range) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Enemy Defense Roll – (+2 Trained Reflexes, -3 Didn’t Know You Were There) = Result: -1 [Disastrous]**  
**✅ Outcome: Critical Ambush Success – He never sees it coming. You disable him instantly.**

---

As the **masked Baroque Works assassin** begins to drop, arms poised like a venomous spider falling from its silk—

&gt; **“Kiwi away.”**

You flick your wrist, and the dense, acidic orb of concentrated kiwi juice blasts from your palm with surgical force. The air ripples, the juice hisses, and the projectile **slams directly into his mask**.

&gt; *THWAP—SSSSHHHH—KRAK*

The impact is wet and sharp. The mask cracks down the middle. The acidic kiwi pulp **floods his eyes**, stinging, blinding, soaking the seams of his mask and armor with a **sticky, enzymatic coating**.

He doesn’t scream—he *gurgles*.

He drops wildly from the vent—not a strike, not a lunge, but a **crash.**

Tashigi’s eyes go wide as a body thuds to the floor next to her.

&gt; “Wha—?!”

Before the agent can even roll, you’re **moving**—one step, two, **baton snapping open with a metal *CLACK*** as you swing around the corner and stride into full view.

&gt; *Teacher mode: activated.*

Your **Seastone-tipped baton** extends, cold and humming with lethality. You advance on the now-writhing assassin, who claws at his eyes, slipping on kiwi pulp as he tries to right himself.

Tashigi looks up from her position, blinking rapidly.

&gt; “You…?!”

You nod once, firm.

&gt; “Cheng. Room 703. Just here to make sure nobody stabs a Marine in the back.”

She blinks.

&gt; “...That’s a hell of a vacation.”

---

### **Baroque Works Agent – Status: Disabled**
- Eyes: Blinded by acidic kiwi  
- Breathing: Labored  
- Weapon: Dropped  
- Current Action: *None. You have full control.*

Tashigi pushes herself upright, sword gripped tightly in one hand, the other holding her bruised temple.

&gt; “Thanks. He was waiting. I didn’t even hear him.”

She eyes the **Seastone tip** of your baton.

&gt; “That’s not standard bounty hunter issue. You really a teacher?”

&gt; *Only you answer that.*

---

**📝 Combat Update:**
- One **hostile down**
- **Vent route cleared**
- Corridor now stable
- Tashigi is injured, but standing
- You are now an *active ally* in Marine eyes

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Tie the agent up. Begin questioning him with Tashigi. Fast and dirty.}
2. {Ask Tashigi what her mission is down here. You’ve earned a few answers.}
3. {Move further in. You’ve got momentum, and Baroque Works knows *something* went wrong.}
4. {Call your Marine contact—Enzo. Time to let someone know what you’ve walked into.}
5. {Use kiwi juice to lock the ceiling vent and reinforce the corridor behind you. No more surprises.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Lay more Kiwi juice. Then knock the Agent out for good measure.

Don't ask me about the price on the baton. I probably could've bought a small house in the east blue with it. You okay, ma'am?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “Seal the route, clean the mess. Safety first, sass second.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Duty Over Drama | Mood: Collected, Gritty Professionalism**  
**🎲 Juice-Lock Deployment – (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Situational Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 KO Roll – Baton Strike (+2 Surprise, +1 Blinded Target) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You lock the corridor down tight, then send the agent to dreamland. Tashigi now sees you as an asset.**

---

You turn slightly, extend your hand again, and release a controlled stream of kiwi juice **along the ceiling vent’s rim**, hardening it mid-flow with a practiced flick of your wrist. The juice thickens, seals, and **locks the vent** shut in a sticky lattice of hardened pulp and acidic residue.

&gt; *If anyone else wants to drop in uninvited, they’re going to taste regret first.*

Satisfied, you turn back to the twitching Baroque Works agent, still groaning, mask half-melted and soaked in juice. He manages a weak, gurgled:

&gt; “Gh-kkk... who the hell are y—”

&gt; **CRACK.**

You don’t answer.  
You just step in and deliver a precise, quick baton strike to the **side of the head**.  
**Non-lethal. Blunt. Clinical.**

He slumps instantly.  
**Unconscious.**

You kneel beside him, checking his pulse—strong but out cold. You grab his knife and toss it aside, noting its make: **obsidian-coated, finely balanced, clearly custom.** You keep it.

&gt; **[+1 Baroque Dagger – Non-standard issue. Lightweight. Possibly poisoned.]**

Then, you look to Tashigi as you holster your baton again with a sigh.

&gt; “Don’t ask me about the price on the baton.  
I could’ve bought a small house in the East Blue with it. Maybe even a yard.”

She laughs softly—short and sharp, like she’s still catching her breath.

&gt; “That’s… more than I paid for my sword.”  
She touches her temple again, winces.

&gt; “I’m okay. Took a hard elbow to the head and rolled into a wall. Nothing’s broken. Just rattled.  
I owe you one, Cheng.”

She pauses, then corrects herself:

&gt; “Eatone.”

You offer a nod.

&gt; “You sure you’re good to keep going, ma’am?”

She wipes some blood from her eyebrow and squares her shoulders.

&gt; “If I wasn't, I wouldn’t be here.”

She looks down at the unconscious agent.

&gt; “But now we know for sure: this corridor’s compromised. Baroque Works is *inside* Rain Dinners’ internal systems.  
They're not just watching—they’re *moving things.*”

---

**📝 Updates:**

- **Vent locked. No more surprise drops.**  
- **Baroque Agent KO’d** – Can be interrogated later.  
- **Tashigi remains active, but injured** – trusts you, defers tactically.  
- **Inventory Updated** – Baroque Dagger acquired.  
- **Status: Clean sweep. You are now a fully embedded ally in this Marine op.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Move forward with Tashigi. Push deeper into Rain Dinners’ inner workings.}
2. {Ask what she knows about Baroque Works. You’ve earned some answers.}
3. {Interrogate the downed agent briefly before continuing. Fast questions, quick gain.}
4. {Use your juice to reinforce this position. Turn it into a fallback point if things go south.}
5. {Contact Enzo. Tell him exactly what’s happening—and ask if this dagger matches anything known.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - That Smoker guy, he's your CO, right? You able to get in contact with him? Whatever's going on here, seems out of my pay grade. Maybe out of both our pay grades.

OOC: Smoker has likely been captured in the trap already

OOC: I have a positive disposition to the Marines

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Smoker, right? Might be time to phone the boss.”**  
**🎭 Tone: Professional Concern | Disposition: Respectful Ally of the Law**  
**🎲 Insight Roll – (Eatone +2 Professional Instinct, +1 Marine Familiarity) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Reaction – (+2 Respect for Transparency, -1 Worry Over Smoker’s Status) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You voice the right concern at the right time—Tashigi is honest with you. She tries to reach Smoker... but something’s wrong.**

---

You nudge the unconscious agent with your boot—just a tap, to make sure he’s not faking a nap—then glance toward the deeper shadows of the corridor.

&gt; “That Smoker guy,” you say quietly, turning to Tashigi,  
&gt; “he’s your CO, right?”

She nods, standing straighter at the mention of his name, as if reflexively steeling herself.

&gt; “You able to get in contact with him?  
Because... whatever’s going on here—it’s *above my grade*. Might be above *both* of ours.”

She exhales slowly, wiping more blood off her cheek with the cuff of her coat.

&gt; “Yeah. It is.”

She pulls a **small Den Den Mushi** from her inside jacket pocket—a different one than before. **Direct line.** You catch a faint glimpse of a scratched “S” engraved in the casing.

She taps it awake.

&gt; **“Captain Smoker, this is Tashigi. Situation update: hostile Baroque Works agents active in casino interior. Requesting sitrep—Captain, come in.”**

Silence.

She tries again.

&gt; “Captain?  
Smoker, this is Tashigi. I’m with a freelance ally. We’ve got a downed agent, compromised corridors, and a high likelihood of organized infiltration. Respond.”

Still nothing.

The Den Den Mushi blinks... then frowns.  
Eyes closed.

&gt; “That’s not signal loss,” she mutters, lowering it slightly.  
&gt; “That’s... severed connection. He’s *offline.*”

You frown.

&gt; “Could mean a lot of things.”

She nods grimly.

&gt; “But when it comes to Smoker?  
*It never means something good.*”

---

**OOC Context Crosscheck:**  
Smoker, at this point in canon, **has just been captured** along with the Straw Hats in **Crocodile’s trap beneath Rain Dinners**.  
He is inside the **Seastone cage** suspended above the Banana Gator pit.  
He’s **off-grid.**

---

**📝 Updates:**

- Smoker **cannot be contacted**. Likely captured.  
- Tashigi is now aware her superior is missing. She will begin shifting into **autonomous Marine op mode**.  
- You are now functioning as her **partner in field assessment**—even without official rank.

---

She lowers the Den Den Mushi, face hardening.

&gt; “That’s it then. We’re on our own.”  
&gt; “We keep moving. Find out how deep this hole goes—and figure out if your lady in blue is still ahead of us... or already fallen in.”

She starts walking again, slower now, hand near her sword.

&gt; “You still with me, teacher?”

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {“Yeah. Let’s move.” Continue with Tashigi deeper into the lower Rain Dinners complex.}
2. {“Wait. Let’s interrogate this guy while we’ve got the chance.” Try to get info while Tashigi still watches your back.}
3. {“You go ahead. Let me watch our rear and cover this point.” Prepare the fallback trap.}
4. {“If we’re doing this, we’re doing this smart.” Draw a quick map with your juice. Navigate tactically.}
5. {“We should get her out too.” Start talking plans to find Vivi. That’s what started this, after all.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - You sure, ma'am? I've seen the newspapers, your CO's a beast. Whatever can take him down can probably turn me into pulp. Should we fall back and call for help? 

I gesture at her injuries with genuine concern

OOC: Out of concern for Smoker and her own pride/bravery, she might insist on continuing deeper.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Are you sure? Because if *he’s* down…”**  
**🎭 Tone: Earnest Concern, Calculated Caution | Focus: Protect the brave, not coddle them**  
**🎲 Emotional Intelligence Roll – (Eatone +2 Empathy, +1 Tactical Thinking) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Pride vs. Wisdom Roll – (+2 Duty, -1 Injury, -1 Trust in You) = Result: 2 [Average]**  
**✅ Outcome: Tashigi hears you—really hears you. She resists at first… but the weight of reality lands. She doesn’t retreat, but she adapts.**

---

You fall into step beside her, close enough to speak low, your voice calm but firm.

&gt; “You sure, ma’am?”

She halts, just slightly—barely a break in step—but enough.

&gt; “I’ve read the newspapers. I’ve seen what your CO can do.  
The man’s a beast. I’ve seen entire pirate crews surrender just because he *lit two cigars at once*.”

You give her a look—not doubt, but genuine worry.

&gt; “If *that* guy’s been taken out by whatever’s in here…”  
&gt; “Then whoever did it could probably fold me into a lunchbox.”

Your tone softens. You raise a hand, gesturing toward the blood on her temple.

&gt; “And you’re already hurt.”

She breathes in sharply through her nose. You see it—the flinch. Not from pain, but from pride. From the *truth.*

&gt; “I’ve had worse.”

&gt; “Not questioning your strength. I’m saying we might need to think bigger.  
Fall back. Regroup. Call in reinforcements. Marines. Hunters. Hell, a Weather Priest from Skypeia if we can get one on short notice.”

That gets a faint snort—half a chuckle, half a sigh.

&gt; “Smoker would never retreat,” she says.  
Then, quieter:  
&gt; “...But he would *think.*”

She steps back toward the wall, leans slightly, touching her head again.

&gt; “I won’t run, Cheng. But you’re right. Charging in blind is a good way to make this a recovery mission instead of a rescue.”

She pulls out a small, black-bound notebook from her inner coat and flips to a sketched floor plan.

&gt; “This is what I have on Rain Dinners’ internal layout. Incomplete.  
If we’re going in, we’re going **around**—not through. Take a service tunnel to flank the lower levels where the cage system is kept.”

She draws a line with a pencil.  
**A longer path. Safer. Smarter.**

She glances at you.

&gt; “Will you take point?”

---

**📝 Tactical Update:**

- Tashigi acknowledges the danger. She will not fall back fully, but will take the **longer, stealthier route**.
- You've preserved her pride while shifting the operation to a safer plan.
- You are now leading the approach. She defers to your instincts until reinforcements arrive (or don’t).

---

**Next Decision:**

1. {Accept point. Guide her through the flank route. Prep juice traps and markers as you go.}
2. {Suggest splitting up. One of you draws fire, the other circles. Risky, but could gain advantage.}
3. {Insist on treating her injuries with first aid before moving. You’ve got a little medical training.}
4. {Map your own juice-route in parallel. If all else fails, you can carve an exit with it.}
5. {Ask her more about Rain Dinners’ internal cage system. You need to know *exactly* what you're walking into.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - Consider me part of your posse, ma'am.

I rip a piece of exquisite cloth off the downed assassin. Before we go, mind if I take a look at those wounds? Don't want you getting an infection later (in a teacher's tone of voice)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected – “Consider me part of your posse, ma’am.”**  
**Action: First Aid via Improvised Materials | Tone: Responsible Adult Energy**  
**🎲 Medical Roll – (Eatone +1 Basic Field Training, +1 Resourcefulness, +1 Teacher Authority Voice) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Resistance to Being Cared For – (+2 Pride, -2 Respect for You and the Facts) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: She grumbles, but lets you tend her wounds. You stabilize her condition and earn deeper trust.**

---

You tuck your baton away, kneel beside the downed assassin, and without hesitation, rip a **clean swatch of silk** from the hem of his overdesigned Baroque Works jacket. It's absurdly luxurious—threaded with gold, probably worth more than your **entire monthly salary** back home.

You twirl it once to test the fibers, then fold it into a **makeshift compress**, your expression all business.

&gt; “Consider me part of your posse, ma’am,” you say, standing again.  
&gt; “But before we play heroes in some underground death-maze—mind if I take a look at those wounds?”

She opens her mouth—probably to object—so you *cut her off with tone alone.*

&gt; “Because if that cut festers and you keel over from a fever in three days,  
*I* am not doing the paperwork.”

She raises an eyebrow. Then sighs like a woman who’s been assigned *extra homework she can’t argue with.*

&gt; “...Fine. Just don’t make a big thing out of it.”

You step in gently, motioning for her to tilt her head.

**The damage:**

- A clean cut along her right brow, bleeding slowed.  
- Minor concussion signs—likely from the impact during her earlier fight.  
- Nothing life-threatening, but **infection risk is real** in an environment like this.

You dab the wound with a **kiwi-acid-diluted cloth tip**—*low concentration*, just enough to cleanse without burning. She winces, but doesn’t flinch.

&gt; “You’re better at this than half the field medics I know,” she mutters.

&gt; “I grade science fair disasters for a living,” you reply. “This is nothing.”

You tie the silk into a tight head wrap, neat and snug. It looks ridiculous. Also kind of badass.

&gt; “There. You’re stabilized. Not dying. No excuse to stop moving.”

&gt; “Understood, Nurse Cheng,” she deadpans—but you catch the smallest smile at the corner of her mouth.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Tashigi is now **treated for infection** and stabilized.  
- Her concussion symptoms have been **partially addressed**—enough to stay alert.  
- Your standing with her has deepened. She sees you not just as backup—but as *reliable.*

---

**Inventory Note:**
- **-1 square meter of Baroque Luxury Silk** (Used)  
- **+1 Kiwi-Acid Cleanser, Improvised (Field Use)**

She nods toward the deeper tunnel.

&gt; “Alright. Let’s go save your blue-haired mystery girl, and maybe catch a Warlord committing treason while we’re at it.”

---

**Next Move:**

1. {Lead the way into the flanking tunnel, juice-sensing ahead for traps or movement.}
2. {Mark a fallback zone with juice on the floor behind you—just in case the whole tunnel caves in.}
3. {Suggest leaving a trail Tashigi can follow if you need to split temporarily. Prep for split maneuver.}
4. {Ask her what intel she has on the trap mechanism Crocodile’s supposed to use. Details could save lives.}
5. {Sneak ahead solo for 30 meters—give her time to fully recover while you scout.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Rational cowardice

​I choke on my spit.

Wait, whoa whoa whoa. WHOA.

Warlord? I thought this was just some low level organized crime? What warlord?

---

You’re halfway through adjusting the compression bandage when **her words hit you.**

&gt; “...maybe catch a Warlord committing treason...”

You freeze.

Then—

&gt; *Cough—coughCOUGH—SPIT*  
&gt; “Wait—**WHOA WHOA WHOA—WHAT?!**”

You stagger back half a step, hand instinctively covering your chest like the **word “Warlord”** just punched you in the ribs.

&gt; “*Warlord?!*  
I thought this was—what, **organized crime?** Black market arms? Casino laundering? Maybe *light child-snatching*?  
But *Warlord*?! What warlord?!”

Tashigi just stares at you.  
There’s a beat of silence.

&gt; “...You really didn’t know.”

&gt; “NO, I DIDN’T KNOW! I came here for a **discount vacation**, not to get blasted by a guy with **government immunity and a sand motif!**”

She sighs. A long one. Then leans against the wall again.

&gt; “Alright. You’ve earned it.”

She looks at you—fully now. No Marine veneer.

&gt; “**Sir Crocodile.**  
You know him from the newspapers. Hero of Alabasta. Pirate turned protector.  
Also—**Warlord of the Sea.** One of the Seven. Works ‘for’ the World Government, but mostly does his own thing.”

She pauses.

&gt; “And he’s the one running **Baroque Works.** Has been for years. Rain Dinners? This whole operation? It’s a front.”

&gt; “A front... for *what?!*”

&gt; “A coup.”  
&gt; “He’s trying to topple the Alabasta monarchy and take control. That woman in blue you saw?  
If I’m right, that’s **Princess Vivi.**”

You feel something between nausea and adrenaline start bubbling in your gut.

&gt; “Oh good. Good.  
Warlord-helmed conspiracies, royal fugitives, secret death basements, and I’ve got a **fruit that makes juice.**”

Tashigi cracks a smile.

&gt; “You’re handling it better than most.”

---

**📝 Major Lore Drop Gained:**

- **Sir Crocodile = Warlord of the Sea**
- **Baroque Works is his personal underground empire**
- The **woman in blue** is almost certainly **Princess Nefertari Vivi**
- Crocodile is attempting a **coup d'état in Alabasta**, using Rain Dinners as a key control point

You are now aware of **the real stakes**.

---

**Next Steps (while your rational brain catches up):**

1. {“Okay. I’m in. But I’m gonna complain the whole way.” Continue down the tunnel with Tashigi, sarcastically.}
2. {“I need a plan.” Stop and sketch a new plan with your juice. Something *smart*, now that you know the scale.}
3. {“This is above us. I’m calling Enzo anyway.” Try again for outside reinforcements while Tashigi watches your back.}
4. {“Let’s go find that princess.” Focus the mission—get Vivi. She’s the linchpin now.}
5. {“I want hazard pay.” Mutter while you sneak ahead. Scout the flank path like you’re not internally screaming.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

---

&gt; “I… Shit… *Eggghh…*”

You lean a hand against the tunnel wall, the weight of what you just learned settling on your spine like a sack of test papers you forgot to grade and now they're *sentient*. Your knees don’t buckle—but your will to keep walking *definitely does*.

Tashigi notices instantly.

Her steps slow. She doesn’t draw her sword. Doesn’t bark orders.  
She just… waits. Watches you. Then approaches—firm, but not forceful.

&gt; “Hey.”

She speaks like you’re one of her cadets. Not beneath her. Not disposable.

&gt; “You don’t have to be a hero.  
You didn’t sign up for this. Hell, I didn’t sign up for this either.”

You mutter something about forgetting your Den Den Mushi. Like a dumbass.  
She gives a crooked smile.

&gt; “It happens. You’d be surprised how many Marines forget theirs during *training exercises,* never mind while chasing Warlords through casino basements.”

Then, softer:

&gt; “But you came this far. You saved my life. You called me ‘ma’am’ like you meant it.  
That tells me everything I need to know.”

She reaches into her coat. Pulls out a small rectangular badge—not a Marine insignia, but something smaller, older.

A **teacher’s pin.**

&gt; “Before the Marines, I worked a year in a community school on Shell Island.  
Thirty kids. Only two books. One chalk stick between them.  
I still think about them.”

She holds it for a second longer… then tucks it away.

&gt; “You came here to relax. And instead, you found out the world’s uglier than you thought.”  
&gt; “But so did I. So does everyone—sooner or later.”

She steps forward. Offers her hand.

&gt; “You don’t have to come any further if you don’t want to. But if you do…  
I’d be proud to have you at my side.”

**📝 Emotional Impact:**

- Tashigi sees you not as a tool, but as an **equal with limits.**  
- Your bond has deepened—**respect born of vulnerability and shared weight.**  
- You are no longer just *freelance help*. She sees you as *comrade.*  
- No pressure. You can still say **no** and retreat.

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Take her hand. “Let’s go before I change my mind.” Continue on, shaken but loyal.}
2. {Take a minute. Sit, breathe, steady yourself, *then* go forward. No shame in needing 60 seconds.}
3. {Nod. “I’ll follow… just not up front anymore.” Support role only.}
4. {Decide to stay and guard the fallback point. Not cowardice—*contingency planning.*}

**🎯 Outcome: You regain composure, reaffirm your moral compass, and Tashigi sees it for what it is—*real courage.***

---

You raise a finger like you’re about to pause class before a pop quiz.

&gt; “*Whew.*”  
&gt; “Just—just give me a second here to process my impending doom.”

You drop to a seated crouch for a breath. Not slumped. Just… grounded.

You give yourself a firm slap on the cheeks—**not dramatic**, just enough to **jolt the cowardice off like dust from a coat**.

&gt; *SPLAT.*  
A few **juice droplets fling off your left hand**, smacking the wall with soft *plips*, forming temporary little green comet-tails before fading.

You sigh.

Then rise.

&gt; “Alright.”  
&gt; “I suppose I couldn’t let a nice lady like you get murdered by yourself.  
Not when I could’ve made a difference.”

Tashigi looks at you, blinking once—then nods slowly.

&gt; “You’re alright, Eatone.”

Her hand doesn’t move to her sword. It rests instead near her **Marine pin**, brushing it once like a grounding stone.

&gt; “Let’s go do something stupid and noble.”

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Eatone’s **resolve has been reaffirmed**. Shaken but stable.  
- Tashigi views you as **equal in bravery**, not bravado.  
- You’ve earned a reputation—**not as a fighter, but as someone who *chooses to stand when it counts*.**  
- You are mentally and emotionally fit to continue the mission.

The tunnel stretches before you now—dim, uncertain, alive with whispered danger.

But not unwatched.  
Not unguarded.  
And **not alone**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Take point again. Back to work. Carefully guide Tashigi along the flanking path toward Rain Dinners’ lower complex.}
2. {Ask one last quiet question—“You ever been this far off-script before?” Just to know you’re not the only one.}
3. {Leave a juice message along the wall—*“We went this way”*—in case others come looking for you.}
4. {Draw a map in juice and hang it near the tunnel entrance. If this becomes a grave, at least it’ll be *a marked one*.}
5. {“Let’s find that princess. And hope she’s not dead yet.” Move with purpose. It’s all about Vivi now.}

---

&gt; “You’re hurt. I’ll take point.”

Your tone is calm, even—but final. You draw your **Seastone-tipped baton** in a smooth, practiced arc, holding it low and backhanded—**non-lethal but absolute**. With your off-hand, you form another **tight juice orb**, compressed and tuned to **burst or bind** on contact.

Tashigi blinks, then exhales. There’s no protest this time. Just a subtle nod as she moves into your **six o'clock position**, sword drawn but held one-handed—*ready*, but not *rushing*.

&gt; “You’ve got the nose, I’ve got the layout.  
You walk, I talk. I’ll correct you if you’re about to charge into an active gator filtration pipe.”

&gt; “...How active are we talking?”  
&gt; “Flesh-dissolving foam active.”  
&gt; “Copy that.”

---

**You step forward.**

The corridor shifts from finished wall to **raw concrete and iron**—**Rain Dinners’ bones**, not the painted skin of the guest floors. The lights dim further. **Your juice orb pulses softly**, casting an eerie green halo on the damp walls.

The silence is thicker here. No footsteps but your own. No voices.  
Just the **distant hum of a subterranean system**—like a crocodile snoring behind metal.

---

**Terrain Details:**

- The path branches **twice**. One toward an **elevator shaft**, sealed. The other—a **maintenance ladder** leading down.  
- Tashigi calls it:  
&gt; “Down. Leads toward the sub-basement air tunnels. We can reach the chamber edge without alerting the main guards.”

You start to descend.

&gt; *Step. Step. Juice-drip. Breath.*

Somewhere ahead: the **cage**.  
Somewhere inside: **Smoker. The Straw Hats. Vivi.**  
And if you wait too long… **Crocodile himself.**

---

**📝 Current Status:**

- **Eatone**: Frontline position | Baton drawn | Juice orb ready  
- **Tashigi**: Following close, sword half-drawn, navigating from map memory  
- **Party Stealth: Moderate** – No detection yet, but environment is narrowing  
- **Mission Objective:** Reach the *cage chamber* unseen. Intercept. Rescue. Survive.

---

**What would you like to do next at the ladder base?**

1. {Send a thin juice tendril into the vent ahead. Scout for heat, movement, or sound.}
2. {Ask Tashigi if she has a code phrase to give to Smoker if he's conscious when you find him.}
3. {Set a juice trap behind you on the ladder. If you're followed, they'll regret it.}
4. {Peek around the next corner silently. Check for guards or cameras.}
5. {Request that Tashigi draw her blade fully. You’re close enough to danger it’s no longer optional.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 / 5 - Slowly slice the cake around the corner. Motion for Tashigi to ready her blade.

Y'know, your CO runs with a Seastone weapon, right? And also has a devil fruit that makes him produce substance.

I hold up my baton with a dripping hand. Aren't I, like a Beri-store version of him? I joke, hoping to lighten the mood

**✅ Outcome: You move like a pro. The joke lands. The bond strengthens. No enemies in immediate sight—*yet*.**

---

You hold up one finger.  
**Silent motion: “Wait.”**

Then, carefully, **slice the corner** like it’s the last piece of Blackbeard’s birthday cake and you’re making damn sure no one sees you sneak it.

&gt; *One foot forward.  
Baton drawn.  
Juice hand steady.  
No sudden movements.*

As you round the corner, your eyes sweep fast:

- **Steel corridor**, slightly wider now.  
- **Two wall-mounted Den Den cameras**—but *rotating slowly*, with a 4-second blind spot.  
- A **fork** in the path ahead. One route marked *Waste Purge Access*. The other… no signage at all. Just cold air drifting out and the faint sound of **dripping chains.**

Your breath catches. That sound?  
It’s **below.**  
Could be the **cage chamber**.

You step back from the edge and motion for Tashigi to draw fully.

She obeys without a word, blade sliding from the scabbard with a clean metallic whisper.

Then—trying to shake the tension just a little—you half-turn and nod to your baton and the sticky droplets still running down your off-hand.

&gt; “Y’know, your CO runs with a Seastone weapon, right?  
Also has a Devil Fruit that lets him produce a substance.”

You hold up your baton.

Then your hand.

Then do a weak little jazz-hands shake with both.

&gt; “Aren’t I like… a **Beri-store version** of him?”

There’s a beat.  
Then a snort from Tashigi.

&gt; “Heh. Only difference is Smoker doesn’t have a kill count involving *juice-based concussions.*”

&gt; “Yet.”

&gt; “Right. I’ll tell him you’re his budget twin when we get him out of that cage.”

She steps up beside you now—**shoulder to shoulder**. Ready.

---

**📝 Tactical Readout:**

- **Corner cleared**: No enemy patrol in immediate sight  
- **Cameras visible**: Identified rotation timing. Avoidable.  
- **Potential Cage Access Located**: The unmarked path with chain drip sounds likely leads to the Straw Hats  
- **Morale: Steady** – Banter = sanity under pressure

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Time the camera and slip down the unmarked hallway. Head toward the cage quietly.}
2. {Use your juice to blind one of the cameras. Keep your rear safe.}
3. {Ask Tashigi what you’ll do *if* the cage is down there—and it’s already filling with water.}
4. {Prep a juice-based adhesive trap near the fork—backtrack security.}
5. {Split. One of you hits the purge corridor, the other scouts the cage route. Fast but risky.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Make silent, tactical hand motions at the cameras and their rotation timing. (Ready to move when you are)

OOC: Tashigi may know about cages, but I don't.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Silent ops. Slide under the cameras. Head for the cage.”**  
**Tone: Tactician-in-Training | Action: Coordinated Movement with Nonverbal Team Signals**  
**🎲 Stealth Maneuver Roll – (Eatone +2 Timing, +1 Juice Sense Precision, +1 Tactical Focus) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Tashigi Coordination Roll – (+2 Marine Training, +1 Trust in You) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You both move flawlessly. Undetected. One step closer to the heart of Crocodile’s trap.**

---

You make a sharp series of **tactical hand signals**, pointing first to the **left camera**, then to the **right**, followed by a flat-palm circular motion:  
**“Rotating, four-second blind spot.”**  
Then two fingers to your eyes, then down the unmarked hallway:  
**“Eyes forward. Target this way.”**

Tashigi nods once, blade low, body coiled like a spring.  
No words.  
Just a slight flex of her shoulder and a silent **“ready.”**

---

&gt; **You move.**

As soon as the camera eyes shift away, you slip past the intersection—fluid and silent, your shoes barely making a sound. Tashigi mirrors you flawlessly, following your exact line of motion with ghostlike precision.

**No alerts.  
No alarm snails.  
No yelling from Baroque goons.**

Only the soft, echoing sound of **dripping chains** as you approach the end of the corridor.

---

**You come to a halt at a grated walkway**, where a **large drop** opens below you—maybe 15 meters down.

Peering carefully over the edge, you see:

- A **massive stone chamber**, artificially excavated and reinforced with iron.  
- In the center, suspended by **titanium-alloy cables**, hangs a **huge cage** made of **Sea-Prism Stone bars**.  
- Inside: five people.  
  - A **boy in a straw hat**, slumped but breathing.  
  - A green-haired man.  
  - A small reindeer in a hat.  
  - A blonde girl in business attire.  
  - And—**Vivi. Blue hair. Very much real.**

Below the cage: **murky water**, churning faintly.

You see **Banana Gators** circling below. At least three. Maybe more.

&gt; *And there’s no one else visible. No guards. No Crocodile. No Robin.*

Tashigi leans next to you and whispers:

&gt; “That’s the Seastone cage. They’re inside.”  
&gt; “If it drops... that’s it.”

You still don’t know what Seastone really means, but **your instincts are firing like a fire alarm in the chemistry lab.**

---

**📝 Situation Update:**

- You’ve reached the edge of Crocodile’s trap chamber.  
- You have **visual** on Vivi and the Straw Hats—**alive**, but confined.  
- **No enemies in sight… yet.**  
- The cage is suspended above Banana Gators. One mistake, and it’s over.  
- You are in stealth. No one knows you’re here.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Whisper to Tashigi: “What’s Seastone? Can we break that cage?” Learn first, act second.}  
2. {Start forming juice tendrils down the wall—create a silent descent path. Maybe you can reach them.}  
3. {Wait. Observe. Crocodile could be coming soon. Let him monologue and give you intel.}  
4. {Send a juice signal to the cage. Just a splash. Alert Vivi someone’s coming—but subtly.}  
5. {Pull back. You’ve got their position. Time to find a way to disable the trap from afar.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I turn to Tashigi and whisper - what... What the hell is going on? Who's blue over there? Who's the kids? Why are they kids? Is there a kid diddler around here? Where's smoker?

---

Your eyes lock on the surreal nightmare below.  
A spinning soup of facts, faces, and **Banana Gator teeth** start to fold in on themselves in your brain.

You lean close to Tashigi, **still whispering**, but with the breathless desperation of a man trying to keep his last few **functional brain cells** from leaping off the balcony.

&gt; “What… what the hell is going on? Who’s blue over there? That *has* to be the girl I saw.  
And who the hell are those kids? *Why are they kids?!*  
Is there a **kid diddler** in this situation? Because that’s **my jurisdiction.** I swear if this whole coup has a predator angle—”

Your voice goes up a little. You catch yourself.  
The juice orb in your hand shudders with the tension.

&gt; “And where is your *captain*? Isn’t he supposed to be in here punching the Warlord in the throat?!”

Tashigi stares at you.

Then places a single hand gently on your shoulder.

&gt; “Eatone.”

&gt; “Yeah?”

&gt; “Breathe.”

You do.  
Barely.

Then she begins, voice just above a whisper—but *perfectly controlled*.

---

&gt; “The girl in blue is **Princess Vivi Nefertari**. Of Alabasta.  
She infiltrated Baroque Works months ago to learn who was behind the rebellion tearing her kingdom apart.”

&gt; “That sounds... like an insane extracurricular.”

&gt; “The ones in the cage? Those are the **Straw Hat Pirates.**”

You blink.

&gt; “They’re pirates?”

&gt; “Yes. But not the bad kind.”

She sighs.

&gt; “The one with the straw hat is **Monkey D. Luffy.** The World Government has no idea what to do with him.  
He’s the kind of person who punches a Celestial Dragon *and then makes friends with the guy he just punched.*”

&gt; “That’s not a real sentence.”

&gt; “They followed Vivi here. They’re trying to help her stop the coup.”

She lowers her voice even further.

&gt; “And if they’re in the cage—**so is Smoker.** He was tailing them.  
Crocodile must’ve caught them all at once. He was waiting for them.”

You glance down again.

The girl in the suit (Nami) is pacing.  
The swordsman (Zoro) looks pissed.  
The kid in the hat is slumped… but not unconscious.

And Vivi… Vivi is gripping the bars like a woman praying the bars are fake.

---

**📝 You now know:**

- The Straw Hats are not random kids. They are **infamous pirates**, but known to oppose evil.
- Princess Vivi is **actively trying to stop the civil war.**
- Smoker is likely in the cage, out of view.
- This is **Crocodile’s big move**—you are here *just* before the moment where canon breaks wide open.

Tashigi glances at you.

&gt; “Still with me?”

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {“...Alright. Let’s get them out.” Begin forming a plan to reach the cage or stop the trap.}
2. {Stay quiet. Watch. Crocodile might appear at any second—this could be *the moment*.}
3. {Use juice to signal Vivi. Let her know someone *good* is nearby.}
4. {Whisper: “Okay. So what’s *your* plan?” Let Tashigi lead this phase.}
5. {“So hypothetically, what would *not* set off an alarm?” Try to access the trap controls.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - If smoker's down there somewhere, whoever caught smoker could be down there too. Let's not be too reckless here.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “If Smoker’s in the cage… whoever caged him is still nearby.”**  
**Tone: Rational Caution | Status: Recon-Over-Rescue Instinct**  
**🎲 Tactical Insight Roll – (Eatone +2 Danger Awareness, +1 Respect for Chain of Command) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Reaction – (+2 Professional Alignment, +1 Shared Worry, -1 Urge to Act Fast) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You hold position. Tashigi agrees. You’re now both in full recon mode, awaiting the arrival of the true threat.**

---

You stare down at the cage suspended in that cavernous room like a **hook baited with people**—and your gut coils into a dense little fist of alarm.

&gt; “If Smoker’s down there somewhere…”  
&gt; “Then *whoever* was strong enough to take him out is still nearby.”

You don’t raise your voice. You don’t flinch.  
But your hand tightens ever so slightly on your baton.

&gt; “Let’s not be reckless. Not yet.”

Tashigi narrows her eyes, lips tightening in grim approval. She nods.

&gt; “Agreed. We can’t win a fight we don’t understand.”

She crouches lower, motioning you back just slightly from the ledge. Together, you settle into the **railing’s shadow**, backs to the wall, **eyes on the drop**.

Your juice orb pulses quietly in your palm, calm and alert, like a watchdog made of pulp and purpose.

---

Then… you hear it.

**The air changes.**

A door far below **hisses open**—somewhere behind the cage chamber.  
A voice follows. **Calm. Cool. Dangerous.**

&gt; “I warned you, Princess.  
Alabasta will be saved—*with or without you.*”

You know that voice. You saw the headlines.  
**Sir Crocodile.**  
Warlord. Coup leader. Absolute bastard with a hook for a hand and no patience for resistance.

You and Tashigi lock eyes.

&gt; *It’s go time. But not strike time. Not yet.*

---

**📝 Update:**

- Crocodile has arrived. He is now monologuing in the chamber below.  
- You and Tashigi are in *perfect stealth position* for recon or a surgical strike if needed.  
- The Straw Hats remain caged. Vivi visibly flinched at Crocodile’s voice.  
- Tashigi is *laser-focused*. Not moving. Waiting for a window.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Observe in silence. Let Crocodile reveal more. Every villain monologue is intel gold.}
2. {Whisper a juice-thread down toward the cage. Try to tap the bars to alert them *without alerting Crocodile.*}
3. {Ask Tashigi: “If he drops that cage… is there anything we can do?” Just in case.}
4. {Begin forming a juice construct across the ceiling—*if you need to drop in fast*, you’ll have a path.}
5. {Pull back slightly. Prep for ranged support. You’re a striker, not a savior. Know your role.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - My eyes widen at the sight of crocodile - guess he really is behind all this.  I gently pat Tashigi's sword arm and shake my head. There is no way I'm fighting a warlord. And there's no way I'm letting you throw yourself at him.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Observe. Confirm. *Do Not Engage.*”**  
**Tone: Controlled Fear + Protective Instinct | Decision: Recon over Heroics**

**🎲 Tashigi’s Instinct to Act Roll – (+2 Duty, +1 Wound Fatigue, -2 You Stopping Her) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: You hold your ground—emotionally and physically. Tashigi pauses. You both stay hidden… and what you see may change everything.**

---

Your **eyes go wide** as **Crocodile** steps into view below.  
There’s no mistaking him:

- Broad-shouldered, tan skin, gold hook glinting in the underground light.  
- Fur-collared coat, Warlord swagger, cigar already lit like the *credits are about to roll*.  
- His presence hits like **a vice on your chest**—the weight of a man who’s destroyed kingdoms and smiled through it.

Your first instinct?  
**Nope.**

You gently reach out and pat Tashigi’s arm—right near the **guard of her blade**, fingers firm but calm. Then shake your head, ever so slightly.

&gt; “There is *no way* I’m fighting a Warlord.”

You nod toward her blade.

&gt; “And there’s no way I’m letting *you* throw yourself at him. Not like this.”

She grits her teeth—but doesn’t move.

You see the fire in her eyes, the clenched jaw. But also the way her **knees wobble for just a second**.  
She exhales.  
And stays put.

&gt; “...You’re right,” she whispers. “He’d kill us both.”

---

Below, **Crocodile paces** in front of the cage, hands behind his back like a man delivering a guest lecture at *Murder College.*

&gt; “You know, I admired your loyalty, Princess. Truly.  
But this kingdom? These people? They’ve been broken for years.  
What I’m doing... is mercy.”

Vivi shouts something in response. You can’t make out the words, but her voice **cracks with fury.**

Crocodile raises his hook.

&gt; “You’ll all serve a purpose. One final message to the rebels above.”

He turns to a **large lever** at the back wall.  
**Your heart skips a beat.**

Tashigi whispers:

&gt; “That’s the drop release. He’s going to kill them.”

---

**📝 Situation Update:**

- Crocodile has begun **monologuing to the cage**—confirmed villain behavior.  
- The **release lever is in view.** If he pulls it, the cage will fall into the Banana Gator pit.  
- Tashigi is *restrained but tense*—ready to break cover if you give her the word.  
- You are both **still unseen.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Whisper: “Do we have a shot at that lever?” Try to disable it with juice.}
2. {Send a juice tendril down to Vivi or Nami. Let them know you’re here—but subtle.}
3. {Start preparing a juice construct across the ceiling. You *might* be able to get above the cage fast.}
4. {Wait. Just a little longer. He may still gloat. The more he talks, the more you learn.}
5. {Look for other exits. If the cage falls… someone has to live to tell the story.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - That cage... Maybe it's not an immediate drop? He seems like the kind of fellow to let his victims have time to ponder their doom.

I grin weakly.

Watch Crocodile &quot;talk&quot; any remaining hope out of Vivi 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “Maybe he wants them to *simmer* first.”**  
**Tone: Grim Observation with a Weak Smile | Action: Recon Continued, Morbid Humor Engaged**  
**🎲 Insight Roll – (Eatone +2 Psychological Read, +1 Villain Trope Recognition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Emotional Control – (+1 Anger, +1 Duty, -1 Wounded) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: Your prediction is correct—Crocodile *isn't* dropping the cage yet. He's playing with them. Watching breaks your heart… but gives you precious time.**

---

You hold your position, fingers trembling just slightly on your baton.  
Then you mutter, voice dry:

&gt; “That cage… it’s not an instant drop, is it?  
He’s the kind of guy who’d give his victims time to *ponder their doom.*”

You flash a **weak grin**, more exhale than joke.  
Tashigi doesn’t laugh—but her eyes flicker with grim understanding.

&gt; “Yeah. He’s a sadist, not a sniper.”

Below, **Crocodile stands now with his back to the cage**, the massive lever still untouched.  
He paces slowly, hand brushing along a **railing** as he speaks. His voice is soft—but in this echoing cavern, it **booms**.

&gt; “You thought friendship would save you.”  
&gt; “You thought a kingdom’s pain could be mended by kindness.”  
&gt; “You even brought children into this. A little reindeer. A child doctor. A pirate with the brain of a sea sponge.”

He turns and steps closer to the cage, raising his hook, **pointing directly at Vivi**.

&gt; “*This is what your hope bought you, princess.*  
Not salvation. Not peace.  
A box. A pit. And teeth.”

Vivi stares back through the bars, shaking—but not backing away.  
Her mouth moves. You can’t hear the words—but **you recognize defiance**.

Crocodile chuckles.

&gt; “No clever speech?”  
&gt; “No dramatic plea? I’d hoped for something more... poetic.”

He takes a **cigar from his coat**, lights it with a tiny flash of sand-generated heat.

Then?

He **sits.**  
Right on the control platform.

&gt; “We’ll wait, then.  
Let your fear catch up.”

---

**📝 Situation Update:**

- Crocodile is **not pulling the lever yet.**  
- He is **psychologically tormenting** them—especially Vivi.  
- The Straw Hats seem groggy or incapacitated, likely from earlier fights.  
- **You now have time.** Not much, but **time.**

Tashigi glances at you, whispering:

&gt; “That’s our window.  
If we’re doing something… we do it now.”

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Start forming a juice thread down to Vivi. Subtle. Whisper your presence. Let her help.}  
2. {Create a juice noose or clamp near the lever—prepare to stop it if pulled.}  
3. {Form a juice walkway across the ceiling. One of you drops above the cage, the other covers.}  
4. {Split up. You flank left, she flanks right. Someone needs to get to the lever.}  
5. {Whisper to Tashigi: “We disable him, *then* get the cage. He’s the threat.” Plan an ambush.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Maybe... Maybe I can use my fruit ability - Kiwi juice, if you haven't smelled it already, to try to make a tendril and jam the lever. No guarantees that its going to be thick enough to work, though.

**🎲 Crocodile Awareness Roll – (+2 Observation, -2 Arrogant Monologue Mode) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**✅ Outcome: You manage to snake a juice tendril through the shadows and wrap the base of the lever—*soft, but sticky enough* to buy time when it matters. Crocodile doesn't notice… yet.**

---

You lower your voice to a whisper, barely audible over the soft echoes of Crocodile’s speech below.

&gt; “Maybe… maybe I can use my fruit.  
Kiwi juice—if you haven’t smelled it already.”

Tashigi exhales faintly through her nose.

&gt; “I thought that was you.”

&gt; “Yeah. It’s me.  
I can form a tendril. Not thick, but… maybe sticky enough to **jam the lever** if he pulls.  
No guarantees.”

You kneel by the railing, shift your weight into your off-hand, and begin to focus.

---

Your palm pulses.

From your fingertips, a **fine green strand** snakes outward—thick as twine, slick as oil.  
It dips below the ledge, hugging the shadows, crawling along the **overhead beamwork** of the chamber.

You **guide it like a living thing**, steering each motion with micro-muscle control and instinct—juice flowing like **liquid intuition**.

Down.  
Left.  
Avoid the hanging chains.  
Avoid Crocodile’s field of vision.

Your breath hitches as the tendril slips under the **lever’s mechanism housing**, finally curling tight around the **release shaft** like a strand of seaweed gripping coral.

&gt; **Connected.**

Not strong enough to stop a full-force pull—but **it’ll slow the release**, maybe jam it if Crocodile does it with one hand.  
And more importantly?  
It gives you a **physical anchor point**. You now have tactile feedback on the lever.

If he moves it?

&gt; **You’ll feel it.**

---

**Crocodile remains oblivious.**  
Still puffing his cigar.  
Still pacing.  
Still talking about kings and fools and the weight of sand and destiny.

&gt; “The people will cheer when I bring order to this rotting land.  
A hero. A savior. A name that lasts.”

You and Tashigi remain crouched, invisible.  
The tendril glows faintly in your vision—*invisible to him*.

She leans in and whispers:

&gt; “You just bought us our first piece of time.  
What’s next?”

---

**📝 Update:**

- **Juice Tendril anchored to the lever** – sticky enough to delay, not stop.  
- You have **physical feedback** if Crocodile makes a move.  
- Crocodile is unaware of your presence.  
- Tashigi is waiting for your lead.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Send another juice thread to Vivi—time to let her know help is here. She might be able to signal.}  
2. {Start constructing a juice sling path to the cage—if you need to reach it fast, this is your prep.}  
3. {Prep to blind Crocodile with a flash of juice directly to his cigar—cut his vision first.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi to scout for a second entrance or sniper angle. You’ll hold here.}  
5. {Wait. Keep observing. The trap is set. Let’s see what he does next.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - Might as well try to juice up any other visible mechanisms. Observe Vivi

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Operation: Juice the Room”**  
**Tone: Quiet Engineer | Action: Passive Juice Control + Observation**  
**🎲 Juice Utility Roll – (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Mastery, +1 Subtle Control, +1 Engineering Intuition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Stealth Check – Crocodile Awareness (+2 Perception, -2 Monologue Tunnel Vision) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You expand your tendril network subtly—no detection, and a little more influence over the room. Meanwhile, Vivi’s body language gives you critical emotional data.**

---

You remain crouched, controlling your breath. Eyes focused, brain spinning like a tired teacher in a class full of spitballs and poor life choices.

&gt; *Alright, Cheng. Time to juice the whole damn test.*

Your off-hand pulses again.

From the thread wrapped around the **lever**, you **split three more strands**—fine, trailing threads of kiwi juice, guided with microscopic precision. They stretch toward **visible mechanisms** on the platform:

- A **pulley brake** along the far right wall—*likely a failsafe*.  
- A **chain-lock wheel** connecting to the winch.  
- And a **trapdoor locking pin** built into the cage rig itself.

None of them are large enough to fully jam. But you’re not trying to stop an engine—you’re **gumming up the works**, adding just enough **stick and resistance** to make *everything slower, squeakier, and sloppier.*

Tashigi watches the lines weave with wide eyes.

&gt; “It’s like... citrus spider silk,” she whispers.

&gt; “Yeah,” you whisper back. “With less murder.  
Usually.”

---

Then, as you let your hand rest again—still connected by the thinnest of threads—you shift your gaze.

**To Vivi.**

You study her with a teacher’s eye—like she’s the one student who hasn’t said a word all semester, but might snap under the pressure of finals week.

&gt; She’s shaking. Not in fear—**in control**.  
&gt; Shoulders tight. Eyes alert.  
&gt; Her hands, clenched around the bars, are **tapping—left, left, pause, right. Left, left, pause, right.**

&gt; **A code? A pattern?** Could be nerves. Could be signal.  
&gt; Her eyes are locked on Crocodile… but her posture says **she’s planning.**

Then you notice something small but key:  
**Her foot shifts. Taps the base of the cage.** Once. Then again.

&gt; A rhythm.

&gt; *She’s testing the floor.*

&gt; She knows. She knows there’s still time.  
She’s **not giving up.**

And that means neither should you.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Juice tendrils now touching **four key points**: Lever, brake pulley, chain lock, trapdoor pin  
- Mechanisms are now **slightly jammed**, fully monitored by touch  
- Vivi appears **alert, active**, possibly planning or communicating in code  
- No detection. Crocodile remains arrogant and monologuing like it’s his job

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi with a juice drop—tap back in the same rhythm. Let her know *someone* is listening.}  
2. {Tell Tashigi: “We’ve got time. I’m building a juice line to the cage. We may need to cross fast.”}  
3. {Begin building pressure in the juice tendrils. If Crocodile activates anything, you can counter.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi if she knows **how** the drop trigger functions—can it be reversed? Can it be sabotaged?}  
5. {Whisper: “If he starts the drop… you go for the winch, I go for the hook. That cage doesn’t fall.” Finalize your emergency plan.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - I'm... I'm at a loss here. If he really commits to it, and if the cage mechanisms actually is an instant-drop, I'm not sure what to do. He could kill us in his sleep if we took him on. He's crocodile, after all.

**✅ Outcome: You admit your fear—and Tashigi doesn’t dismiss it. She steps into the leadership role *you’re too honest to fake right now.*

---

You let out a quiet exhale—your hands are steady, but your soul isn’t.

Your voice is soft, just above the sound of Crocodile’s grandiose declarations below:

&gt; “I’m… I’m at a loss here.”

Tashigi doesn’t move.

&gt; “If he really goes for it—if the cage mechanisms are a true instant-drop...  
I don’t know what to do. I can slow things down, but I can’t stop physics.  
And if we take him on?”

You glance at her, eyes wide with unfiltered truth.

&gt; “He could kill us in his sleep. He’s **Crocodile.** He took out *Smoker.*  
I’m not stupid. I’m not suicidal.”

There’s no panic in your tone—just brutal, **adult honesty**, the kind that makes you an excellent teacher and a reluctant hero.

Tashigi looks at you—and this time, she doesn’t respond with fire or blind courage.

She nods.  
Quietly.

&gt; “I know.”

She watches Crocodile below—*calm, poised, entirely in control*. Then she speaks in that low, focused voice of hers—**the voice of someone who's been left in command by default too many times.**

&gt; “If he pulls that lever, we act. We buy seconds. That’s all we need.  
Because if anyone’s going to turn this around... it’s not you. It’s not me.”

She nods toward the cage.

&gt; “It’s *them.* That pirate crew may be the only group in the world reckless enough to survive this.”

You frown, confused.

&gt; “But they’re kids—”

&gt; “They’re **monsters.** Friendly ones, but monsters.”  
&gt; “The green-haired one once cut a galleon in half.  
The Straw Hat broke into a Marine fortress because someone insulted his cook.”

You blink.

&gt; “...That’s insane.”

&gt; “Exactly. So we don’t fight Crocodile.  
We give *them* the seconds they need… and then we run like hell.”

---

She touches her sword’s hilt.

&gt; “That’s our role.  
*We’re the delay.*  
You slow the gears.  
I break the chain.  
We turn seconds… into a jailbreak.”

---

**📝 Emotional and Tactical Update:**

- You’ve admitted your fear, and it’s been met with trust—not dismissal.  
- Tashigi is stepping into command-mode, **shouldering the suicidal pressure** so you don’t have to.  
- Your new role is clear: **not to win. Not to fight Crocodile. Just to stall long enough** for the real chaos to wake up.  
- You have options now—but no illusions.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {“Alright. I’m the slowdown. You’re the break point. Let’s prep.” Begin reinforcing tendrils, get ready.}  
2. {“I want to give Vivi a heads-up. If she knows, she might start waking the others up.” Tap a juice thread down.}  
3. {Ask what happens if the cage drops anyway. &quot;Do we have a Plan B? Like… juice raft level Plan B?&quot;}  
4. {Start placing juice reservoirs along the ceiling. If you detonate them later, it’ll create distractions or hazards.}  
5. {“Alright. When he moves, you scream. I’ll make it rain.” Finalize your contingency plan together.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 4 - I don't know... But I suppose we've made it this far. Pat her shoulder lightly.

OOC: The more alert denizens of the cage may notice green liquid dripping into the room, but don't know the source. Perhaps it's a plumbing leak?

**🎲 Cage Crew Awareness – (Nami +2 Observation, Zoro +1 Suspicion, -1 Distance) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**✅ Outcome: You rig the chamber with silent, concealed juice bombs across the ceiling beams. The Straw Hats notice… but without context, they’re just confused.**

---

You press your palm gently to Tashigi’s shoulder—steady, warm, honest.

&gt; “I don’t know if this will work.  
But we’ve made it this far.”

She nods once, no words needed.  
The air between you is solid now—**steel, not fluff.**

You raise your off-hand and **extend five small orbs of juice**, sticky and dense, flowing upward to the metal rafters and recessed supports of the ceiling.

They move like **silent ghosts**, crawling above the chamber like they’re **sentries of the fruit itself**.

Each orb lodges into an unseen groove or lip above the following:

- One above the **lever control panel**  
- One above the **cage itself**  
- One directly over **Crocodile’s “throne” spot**  
- One above the **pulley brake unit**  
- And a fifth—over the **exit corridor door**, just in case things go sideways

&gt; *Five citric bombs.*  
&gt; Primed. Silent. Suspended in tension.

One snap of your fingers later… and they’ll **burst** in sticky, vision-blurring, **traction-ruining citrus hell.**

**Below, in the cage…**

Zoro’s eyes open—one eye first, then both. He sniffs.  
Looks up.  
Sees a thin green drop—splat—hit the metal grate.

&gt; “...Juice?”

Nami glances upward too, eyes narrowing.

&gt; “Plumbing leak?” she mutters. “In a deathtrap room?”

Chopper lifts his nose and sniffs.  
&gt; “That smells… like fruit?”

Luffy doesn’t move.

Vivi’s fingers stop tapping.  
Her gaze turns upward—and **lingers** just a moment too long.

She knows something’s changed.  
But she doesn’t react.  
Just waits. Tense. Poised.

---

**Crocodile says nothing. Still basking in his own silence. Still waiting for fear to ripen.**

---

**📝 Battlefield Update:**

- Five **juice reservoirs deployed** in key spots—triggerable at will  
- Straw Hat crew (Nami, Zoro, Chopper) has **noticed the presence** of green drips, but is unaware of source  
- Vivi suspects *something*, but plays it close  
- You now have **the entire battlefield prepped** for maximum disruption  
- Crocodile remains unaware. He is… too busy savoring control.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi—if she knows, she can wake the others, subtly prep them. Use juice tap to confirm you're here.}  
2. {Prep a trigger phrase with Tashigi—one word, and you both strike. Decide now.}  
3. {Prep your internal countdown. If Crocodile touches the lever, you detonate the ceiling immediately.}  
4. {Create a juice line across the chamber. In case you need to **swing in** hero-style.}  
5. {Wait. You’ve done enough for now. Let the pieces sit—see what breaks first.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 5 - Maybe Crocodile might leave to let them stew in their mortality. Maybe the cage lowers very, very slowly. Who knows, we might not have to go loud at all.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “Let’s just… not die yet.”**  
**Tone: Watchful Patience | Action: Strategic Stillness | Hope: Maybe, just maybe, this resolves itself**  
**🎲 Patience Roll – (Eatone +2 Discipline, +1 Cautious Instincts, +1 Every Adult Decision You’ve Ever Made) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Crocodile's Action – (Crocodile +2 Theatrics, +1 Sadism, -1 Actual Time Pressure) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: Crocodile doesn’t trigger the trap. Not yet. He *likes* the waiting game. You gain another window. Your decision to wait is—**for now—**the perfect call.**

---

&gt; “Maybe…”

You whisper it more to yourself than to Tashigi.

&gt; “Maybe he’ll leave. Let them stew in it a while longer.  
Or maybe the cage lowers… real slow. I mean, he’s a theater kid at heart, isn’t he?”

She smirks—tense but appreciative of the gallows humor.

You both settle deeper into the shadows above, **letting stillness become strategy**.

---

**Below:**

Crocodile finishes his cigar, flicking the ash near the edge of the drop pit. It disappears into the gator-churned water below with a hiss.

He doesn’t move to the lever.  
Instead, he stands, turns slowly, and gazes up at the ceiling—**not at you**, just at the structure.

&gt; “This place is beautiful, isn’t it?” he says, unprompted.  
&gt; “So much iron. So much certainty. You drop a thing from high enough, it breaks.  
No questions. No debate. Nature, in its purest form.”

He pauses. Then steps toward the exit corridor, lazily brushing the lever with one gloved hand.

&gt; “Let them sit with it. A little longer.  
The mind breaks faster than the body.”

He walks.  
**Right past your bomb above the door.**  
You tense.

But… he **doesn’t touch the lever**.

He leaves.

The chamber’s silent again—save for the **chain creak** and the **slow, soft mechanical hum**.

The cage?  
**Begins to descend.**

&gt; *But painfully, excruciatingly slowly.*

---

Tashigi exhales like someone who’s been holding a live grenade under her ribs.

&gt; “He’s giving us time. Not on purpose.  
But we’ve got it.”

---

**📝 Resulting Status:**

- Crocodile has **left the chamber**.  
- The **cage is now descending**, very slowly—likely a psychological tactic  
- Your juice traps remain **active**, untouched  
- You and Tashigi are **undetected**, in prime position to intervene—or escape  
- Vivi is alert. Zoro is awake. Nami is suspicious. The stage is set.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now’s the time. Signal Vivi. Tap a juice thread onto the cage—let her know *you’re here.*}  
2. {Use the slow descent to your advantage—start constructing a juice catwalk down to the cage.}  
3. {Talk with Tashigi. “If we trigger the traps… do we drop in, or run like hell?” Time to choose your contingency.}  
4. {Let it drop a little farther. Wait until the cage is low enough that a fall wouldn’t kill them if you messed up the catch.}  
5. {Begin prepping juice to **freeze or jam the pulley system**. You might be able to *stop* the descent.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 5 - That is a comedically slow cage drop. He really is a theater kid. Let's make sure he's actually cleared the room.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “Comedically slow drop. Confirm theater kid has left the stage.”**  
**Tone: Dry Humor with Tactical Discipline | Action: Security Sweep**  
**🎲 Surveillance Sweep Roll – (Eatone +2 Perception, +1 Subtle Juice Recon, +1 Theater Kid Detection Bonus) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Crocodile’s Deception Chance – (Crocodile +2 Paranoia, -2 Satisfaction High) = Result: 2 [Average]**  
**✅ Outcome: The room is clear. Crocodile has actually left. No fake-outs. The cage continues its long, dramatic descent—and you’re free to act unobserved.**

---

You squint toward the hallway Crocodile left through, then glance back at the *agonizingly slow* cage drop, its chains groaning louder than your average homeroom complaint about group projects.

&gt; “That is a *comedically* slow descent.”

Tashigi mutters, smirking:

&gt; “You weren’t kidding. Theater kid energy. All he’s missing is stage lighting and an internal monologue.”

&gt; “He *had* the monologue.”

You take a deep breath and extend your senses—**both physically and through your juice network**.

One of your dormant ceiling tendrils **splits**, snaking silently down the corridor Crocodile walked through. You guide it along the doorframe, down the wall, into the shallow cracks between stone.

You feel **nothing**.

&gt; No lingering footfalls.  
&gt; No breathing.  
&gt; No temperature change.  
&gt; Not even a Den Den Mushi resonance.

Tashigi’s sword tip lowers slightly, just an inch.

&gt; “He’s gone.”

---

The room is yours.

- The cage continues to lower, slowly. Still about **5 meters from the water.**  
- The Straw Hats are stirring more now—**Zoro sitting up**, **Nami pacing**, **Vivi fully alert**.  
- Luffy remains slumped, but twitching. Alive. Maybe out cold.  
- The Banana Gators churn the water lazily below like they know **appetizers are being plated.**

---

**📝 Tactical Status:**

- Chamber: **Clear of hostiles**  
- Cage: **Lowering very slowly**  
- Juice surveillance: **Maintained and secure**  
- Straw Hats: **No longer passive.** You may be able to make contact.  
- Tashigi: **Focused and alert**, ready for next phase

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Make contact with Vivi. Subtle juice tap, then signal the rhythm she used earlier. Let her know it’s help.}  
2. {Freeze the descent mechanism. Lock it with juice. Stop the cage before it gets any closer to the Gators.}  
3. {Create a juice ramp or swingline to the cage. Prepare for fast physical access if needed.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi to circle down toward the winch assembly—just in case. You’ll cover her from here.}  
5. {Wait another minute. Let the Straw Hats fully come to. You might be able to coordinate a strike *with* them.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - It's a pretty high drop from here. I can prepare a juice waterfall to drop me in, then I'll turn around and break your fall. Sound good? (don't actually construct the juice fall yet)

OOC: Meanwhile, the denizens of the cage observe their slowly approaching demise. Also the scent of tropical fruits. Its probably from the casino's passive ambient scents sprayers or something.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Juice Fall Plan: Soft Descent, Hard Resolve.”**  
**Tone: Practical with a Splash of Heroism | Action: Pre-Planning a Two-Person Drop Entry**  
**🎲 Planning Roll – (Eatone +2 Engineering Instinct, +1 Devil Fruit Versatility) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Tashigi’s Trust Roll – (+2 Confidence in You, +1 Coordination Mindset) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: The plan is sound, the coordination locked in. Tashigi accepts without hesitation. You’re not building it yet… but when you do, it’ll *work*.**

---

You lower your voice as you kneel beside the lip of the ledge, eyeing the slow-drifting cage, still descending at a snail’s pace toward that Banana Gator buffet line below.

&gt; “It’s a pretty high drop from here.”

Tashigi gives a half-nod, already calculating angles.

&gt; “Tactically poor for a direct descent, unless you’re insane.”

You glance at her, hand twitching slightly, palm wet with anticipation.

&gt; “So I’ll build a **juice waterfall**.  
You know. Surf my way down with some *citrus dignity*, then I’ll flip around and catch your fall with a solid juice pad. Sound good?”

She doesn’t even pause.

&gt; “Sounds good.”

&gt; “Really?”

&gt; “You’ve gotten me this far without either of us getting stabbed, crushed, or eaten.  
At this point, if you said you could knit me a parachute out of kiwi pulp, I’d believe you.”

You grin.

But the waterfall doesn’t form yet.

&gt; *You just hold the idea in your palm.*  
Like a card up your sleeve.  
Like a fire drill bell that hasn’t rung yet.

---

**Meanwhile, in the cage...**

**Zoro** is watching the walls now.  
He doesn’t speak—but his one visible eye is scanning slowly… then twitches as he catches a faint *glimmer* on the metal beam above.

&gt; “Oi,” he mutters. “Anyone smell… fruit?”

**Chopper’s** ears perk.

&gt; “Yeah! Tropical! Like mango or… kiwi?”

**Nami** squints.

&gt; “That’s not the casino air system. This place is too deep for scent misting…”

She walks to the bars again, hand on hip.

**Vivi** says nothing.  
But she taps the bars **twice**, then rests her hand *flat* against the steel.

&gt; Like she’s waiting for a hand to meet hers.  
&gt; Or a message to come back.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- The **Juice Fall plan** has been verbally coordinated with Tashigi.  
- Execution is pending, but it will **absolutely work** when triggered.  
- The **Straw Hats are now more alert**—the scent of kiwi in the air is not going unnoticed.  
- Vivi seems **ready to communicate**.  
- You have **the initiative**. Crocodile has left the stage. For now.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now’s the time. Signal Vivi with a juice thread—match her rhythm from earlier. Let her know it’s you.}  
2. {Go ahead and build the juice waterfall. Quiet, anchored to the ledge. You’ll hold until it’s needed.}  
3. {Begin forming a juice shield—if things go bad, you’ll want a barrier between cage and Crocodile’s return.}  
4. {Send a juice tendril into the pulley housing. *Prep it to seize.* You could stop the drop mid-motion.}  
5. {Wait. Ten more seconds. Let the Straw Hats settle, let Vivi react first. She might act.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 5 - I start gathering juice in my hand.

OOC: Meanwhile, the bananagators get disturbingly close. Too close.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “Hold. Gather. Watch the water.”**  
**Tone: Tense Anticipation | Action: Delay With Purpose**  
**🎲 Juice Control Roll – (Eatone +2 Focus, +1 Calm Under Pressure) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Gator Threat Progression – (Predator Instinct +2, Hunger Timer -1, Cage Descent +1) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You remain cool as the situation begins to boil. Your juice is ready. The gators are closer now. Disturbingly close.**

---

You don’t rush it.

You don’t jump.

You don’t panic.

&gt; *Not yet.*

You slowly begin gathering a **thick orb of juice** into your off-hand, letting it swell—viscous and pulsing—like the **calm core of a tropical storm**. A shield. A weapon. A command. Whatever it needs to be.

The room is quiet, save for the **slow grind of chain over pulley** and the **rising ripple** of water beneath the cage.

But your focus shifts—not upward, not forward—

&gt; **Down.**

And what you see makes the hair on the back of your neck lift like it’s answering a roll call.

---

**The Banana Gators are no longer circling lazily.**

They are **grouping.**

- One is directly beneath the cage now, circling in a tight coil.
- Another is lifting its **snout higher** than natural—**testing the air**, jaws slightly parted.
- A third… is **trying to climb the wall** of the pit—scraping claws on steel with a low, gurgled grunt of hunger.

Tashigi whispers beside you, quiet as death:

&gt; “They know the drop’s coming.”

&gt; “Or they’ve been trained to respond to it.”

The cage is **five meters from the water.**  
Maybe six.  
The Gators?  
**Too close.**  
Close enough that one *jump* might put steel in its mouth.

---

Inside the cage:

- **Zoro is standing now.**  
- **Nami is pacing like a cornered cat.**  
- **Vivi's knuckles are white.**  
- **Chopper has vanished—likely hiding behind Luffy.**  
- **Luffy? Still slumped. Still breathing.**

&gt; But not for long.  
&gt; Because the water’s **close enough to feel.**

---

**📝 Tactical Update:**

- You are fully **juice-charged and ready to act.**  
- **The Gators are converging.** You’ve got **moments** before the cage hits striking distance.  
- Tashigi is watching your hand. **Waiting for the signal.**  
- The room is **yours**—but not for long.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now. Signal Vivi—match her rhythm from earlier with a juice tap. Let her know you’re here.}
2. {Start building the juice fall—now. Descend and intercept. Even if it’s messy.}
3. {Trigger the juice tendrils—jam the pulley system. Try to **freeze the cage in place.**}
4. {Whisper: “We drop now.” Let Tashigi know it’s time. Go for full entrance.}
5. {Launch a juice blast at the nearest Gator—alert the cage crew and scatter the predators. Loud, but decisive.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - A deluge of tropical green spills out from one of the rooftop vents. I slide out, riding the wave, controlling the juice such that it slows my descent. Upon landing, I turn around and hold my arms out, ready for a princess carry of a catch.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “JUICE DROP: Hero Mode Engaged.”**  
**Tone: Daring. Theatrical. Righteous Citrus Intervention.**  
**🎲 Juice Fall Execution Roll – (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Creative Descent, +1 Tactical Momentum) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Gator Alertness – (+2 Hunger, -1 Flash Movement Distraction) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**🎲 Tashigi Drop Coordination – (+2 Agility, +1 Trust, +1 She's Been Waiting For This) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: The drop is cinematic perfection. You descend like a pulp-slicked legend. Tashigi follows your cue flawlessly. The Gators? Momentarily stunned. The Straw Hats? Officially confused and extremely alert.**

---

From above, the first thing the Straw Hats see is a sudden **green glow**, bursting from a vent like the casino's AC system just got replaced with a fruit smoothie on overdrive.

A **torrent of tropical liquid** spills downward, cascading like a waterfall woven from kiwi and momentum.

And then—**you.**

Sliding down the flood, one hand guiding the flow, the other balancing against gravity and ridiculousness, your **coat flares**, your **hair lifts in the wind**, and for one glorious second, it’s like you’ve been called down from the heavens—

&gt; —to **deliver righteous juice-based justice.**

You **touch down at the base of the platform**, boots splashing into the now-slick metal floor, the remaining juice flowing out around you like **liquid silk**.

And you spin.

&gt; Arms out.  
&gt; Feet solid.  
&gt; Eyes locked upward.

&gt; “*Come to papa.*”

**Tashigi drops.**

No hesitation.

She jumps from the ledge above with the grace of a Marine-trained swordswoman, coat trailing behind her like a comet, and in a single, perfect motion—

&gt; **WHUMP.**

You catch her.

Full princess carry.

She blinks.  
A little breathless.  
You both hold it for a beat too long.

&gt; “You caught me.”

&gt; “I’m strong. I lift students all the time.”

&gt; “...That’s somehow less romantic.”

You set her down, and she immediately draws her sword and spins to face the cage.

---

**Inside the cage:**

&gt; “Who the hell is *that?!*”  
Nami points at you like you’re an anime plot twist.

&gt; “I smell kiwi!”  
Chopper’s voice squeaks from behind Luffy’s legs.

&gt; “Teacher?” Vivi whispers, stunned.

**Zoro** just squints.

&gt; “...Huh. Style’s weird. I don’t hate it.”

---

**Gators:** momentarily stunned by the flash of movement and citrus scent. One backs up, confused. Another snorts. A third tries to lick the falling juice.

---

**📝 Tactical Situation:**

- You and Tashigi are now **on the platform beside the cage.**  
- The cage is **still descending**, now about **2 meters from the water.**  
- The Banana Gators are **temporarily distracted**.  
- **Juice waterfall remains active** for exfil or emergency maneuvering.  
- The Straw Hats are alert, confused, and increasingly ready.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi clearly—“We’re here to help. Hold tight.” Begin the rescue.}  
2. {Call out to Zoro and Nami—“You two. If you’ve got strength, get ready.” Prep them for impact.}  
3. {Jam the cage winch mechanism with juice—try to **halt descent completely.**}  
4. {Turn to Tashigi—“You guard the cage. I’ll handle the gators.” Hero moment, inbound.}  
5. {Snap your fingers. Detonate the overhead juice traps as a diversion. Showtime.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - motion to the caged to be quiet. Attempt to lock up the mechanisms with my built up juice. Point at Tashigi, then the lock.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 3 Selected – “Shh. Juice the Lock. Let’s stop this drop.”**  
**Tone: Silent Command | Action: Citrus-Fueled Mechanism Sabotage**  
**🎲 Juice Lock Execution – (Eatone +2 Juice Control, +1 Prior Contact with Mechanism, +1 Held Charge) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Tashigi Coordination Roll – (+2 Tactical Compliance, +1 Immediate Focus) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Gator Awareness – (+2 Instinct, -2 Distraction from Descent Halt) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: The winch *locks tight*. The cage freezes mid-descent. The Gators lose momentum. Tashigi follows your signal with military precision. And the Straw Hats? Realize their lives just got a fighting chance.**

---

You raise your hand—**palm open, motioning toward the cage**—a sharp gesture for **silence**.

Inside, Vivi catches it first.  
She lifts her hand and echoes it: **flat palm, stillness.**  
Nami gets it. Grabs Chopper before he squeaks.  
Zoro? Already quiet.

You point next—toward the **cage's overhead pulley housing**—and then jab your baton toward it sharply.

**Tashigi nods.**  
She moves without words, stepping toward the mechanism, blade held down and tight like a scalpel instead of a weapon. She positions herself—**one precise strike away** from slicing the primary tension lock if things go wrong.

Then—**you act.**

---

The orb of juice in your hand pulses.

You release it upward with a silent, rolling motion of your fingers.  
It **flares across the chain groove**, splits into three strands, and **slams into the tension wheel, the central brake housing, and the backup safety clamp.**

The reaction is instant.

&gt; *SCCCCCHHTK—!*

The entire **pulley seizes.**  
The chain jitters.  
The cage groans—but **stops**.  
Two meters above the water.  
**Dead still.**

---

**The Banana Gators lurch**—surprised by the sudden lack of progress. One tries to jump, but only hits open air and **splashes down hard**, churning froth and anger below.

One of them **snaps at another**, agitated by the delay.  
You’ve stalled their feeding frenzy.  
**You’ve stolen Crocodile’s timing.**

---

Tashigi remains perfectly in position—watching the lock like a coiled trap.

Inside the cage, **the Straw Hats all blink.**  
Zoro nods slowly.  
Nami grips the bars and **smiles for the first time since you arrived.**  
Vivi?

She exhales, shoulders lowering slightly, eyes never leaving you.

---

**📝 Tactical Update:**

- **Cage descent: HALTED. Two meters above water. Mechanisms jammed.**  
- **Tashigi in guard position.** She’s holding the fail-chain.  
- **Straw Hats: Now *fully aware* you’re on their side. Morale: Rising.**  
- **Gators: Confused, disorganized.**  
- **Chamber: Yours. For now.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Speak up. “We’re getting you out.” Begin unlocking or cutting the cage.}  
2. {Ask Vivi directly: “Are you hurt?” Check the state of the group. Prioritize triage.}  
3. {Have Tashigi assist with the cage while you form juice platforms below—just in case the cage drops.}  
4. {Prep a trap at the hallway Crocodile exited through. You don’t trust him to stay gone.}  
5. {Climb onto the cage. Start inspecting the top for locks or vulnerabilities. Engineer this escape.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - remain silent. Motion to Tashigi's sword, then to the bars of the cage, and tilt my head questioningly. Observe the caged reactions.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “No Words. Just Steel, Citrus, and a Question.”**  
**Tone: Silent Leadership | Action: Tactical Nonverbal Coordination**  
**🎲 Communication Clarity Roll – (Eatone +2 Nonverbal Expression, +1 Situation Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎲 Straw Hat Insight – (Nami +2, Zoro +1, Vivi +2, Group Coordination +1) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: The message is clear. Tashigi understands. The Straw Hats understand. You’re not just random rescue—**you’re a plan in motion.**

---

You keep your mouth shut.

&gt; No dramatic rescue speech.  
&gt; No declaration of justice.  
&gt; Just a gesture.

You point to **Tashigi’s sword**.

Then to the **bars of the cage**.  
A slight tilt of your head. *“Can it be done?”*

Tashigi’s brows furrow for just a beat—but then her eyes widen slightly with realization.

&gt; She nods.  
&gt; Once. Firm. Controlled.

She steps closer to the cage, running two fingers along a bar. Tests it.  
Her blade shifts in her grip.

She mouths, silently:

&gt; **Seastone.**

Then crosses her arms to form an “X”—**can’t cut it.**

&gt; *Damn.*

---

But your eyes stay on the cage.

You shift your gaze inside. Watch the crew.

**Vivi’s expression shifts first**—from fear to a kind of **purposeful calculation.** She watches you like someone who’s suddenly found the thread of a riddle.

She taps the bar softly—twice, pause, twice.

&gt; *“I understand.”*

**Nami watches your exchange**, then eyes the winch assembly and chain brake—realization dawning.  
She nods at Vivi.

&gt; “They’re planning something.”

**Zoro squats, tension coiled.**  
One hand on his bandana.  
Just in case.

**Chopper peeks from behind Luffy.**  
&gt; “I think the pineapple guy’s with us!”

Luffy’s eyes open slightly.  
He blinks once.  
Smiles.

&gt; “He smells like juice.”

---

Tashigi whispers beside you:

&gt; “We can’t cut the bars.  
But if we disengage the top link… we might be able to lift the whole thing with your juice. Or tip it.”

She watches you.

&gt; “You want to make this cage useless, Cheng… you’ve got about **thirty seconds** before Crocodile realizes he forgot to monologue about *why he’s always one step ahead.*”

---

**📝 Status Recap:**

- **Cage is jammed mid-drop. Seastone bars: uncuttable.**  
- Straw Hats: **Fully aware.** Mentally synced. Ready to move on your lead.  
- Vivi: Actively following your visual cues.  
- Tashigi: Awaiting your next direction.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Climb the cage. Inspect or begin juice-dissolving the top link. Try to open it like a kiwi.}  
2. {Send juice into the link joint, swell it slowly, try to *pop* it from the inside. Quiet force.}  
3. {Tilt the cage—build a juice ramp on one side and tip the cage just enough to unseat it. Risky but dramatic.}  
4. {Look to Nami and Vivi. Motion for them to be ready to move. Juice will do the rest.}  
5. {Hold position. Lay more juice into the pulley above. You *might* be able to reverse the winch.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - start pacing nervously, quietly. Shit, cutting the bars was Plan A. I don't think I'll have time to destroy the mechanisms before Croc notices something off...

I eye the lock. It's not Seastone, but it sure looks hardened. Maybe not cuttable. but maybe, a kiwi key...

**✅ Outcome: The bars can’t be cut. The mechanism can’t be yanked. But the *lock*? You might be able to **grow your way in.** And it might just work—**if you're precise.**

---

You start pacing.

Quiet. Controlled.

But not calm.

&gt; “Shit…”

You whisper it through your teeth like it might slide into a shadow and never return.

&gt; “Cutting the bars was Plan A.  
Now we’re on Plan… kiwi.”

Tashigi looks over, alert—but doesn’t speak. She can tell you’re calculating.

You glance up at the **cage’s hanging lock**, the only visible **hinge point** connecting the Seastone cage to the **steel-reinforced support ring**.

&gt; *Not Seastone.*  
&gt; *Not meant to resist power—just weight.*

&gt; *A weakness.*

It’s old. Worn.  
Thick, yes—but the **keyhole is exposed**, and the steel around it isn’t quite as polished as the rest.

And then your eyes narrow.

You reach into your palm and begin forming something small—something **thinner**, more focused. Not a blast. Not a flood. Something **precise**.

&gt; “...Maybe I can grow a key.”

You press your juice into the shape of a **soft vine**, narrowing it to the width of a **lockpick**, then curling it gently, letting it harden into a pliable, fibrous rod.

A **kiwi juice filament**, condensed, acidic enough to eat into cheap metal, and strong enough to **wiggle.**

You guide it with a twitch of your fingers—sliding it toward the lock.

Tashigi leans in slightly.

&gt; “What are you doing?”

&gt; “Making fruit-based locksmithing history.”

---

The filament reaches the keyhole. You insert it slowly. No force. No splash.

&gt; *click*  
&gt; *clack*

It squirms inside—like a worm in warm soil—**testing teeth, grooves, tension.**  
You sweat.  
Focus.  
Twist.

&gt; *click… click…*  
&gt; **CLUNK.**

The lock **jolts open.**

Not fully. Not yet.  
But the mechanism inside just **gave**.

**You’re in.**

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Kiwi Key = *Inserted successfully.*  
- Lock = **Engaged and partially compromised.**  
- You may now attempt to either **unlock it**, **break it from within**, or **let it weaken further before striking.**  
- Straw Hats = Watching with silent awe.  
- Tashigi = Eyes wide. You can tell—**you’ve surprised her.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Finish the unlocking. Twist the key fully. Let the cage fall open—or at least loosen the frame.}  
2. {Freeze. Let the juice *eat into* the mechanism longer. Let it corrode further. Patience.}  
3. {Back away and nod to Tashigi—“Now. One clean strike.” Use the softened lock as a weak point.}  
4. {Break it from within. Swell the juice key. *Pop* the lock outward like a burst kiwi seed.}  
5. {Signal the Straw Hats—“Brace. Something’s about to happen.”}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Keep poking at the lock, try to push up the pins with kiwi juice hydraulics.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Hydraulic Kiwi Key: Citrus Lockpicking Edition”**  
**Tone: Focused Improvisation | Action: Pick the Lock Using Fruit Physics**  
**🎲 Precision Fruit Engineering – (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Lock Theory, +1 Improvised Pressure System) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Lock Integrity – (Hardened +2, Corroded -2, Improvised Maintenance -1) = Result: -1 [Disastrous]**  
**✅ Outcome: You don’t just pick the lock. You *dominate* it. It gives way under your controlled pressure like it was made of butter. The cage connection is now **unlatched**—ready to open.**

---

You grit your teeth, lower your stance, and put all your focus into the twitching, **fibrous juice strand** inside the lock.

&gt; “Alright... let’s play house, Kiwi style.”

You shift your fingers like you’re manipulating a marionette, and inside the lock, the juice responds—**swelling in micro-pulses**, like little flexing muscles.

&gt; Push.  
&gt; Curl.  
&gt; Stretch.  
&gt; Compress.

The juice splits into five *sub-filaments*, each one **pressing upward like miniature pistons**.

&gt; *click… click—clickclickclick—*  
&gt; **KA-CHUNK!**

The lock **jolts open**, the pins fully disengaged by the *hydraulic pulse* of your fruit’s power. You hear the satisfying **clang** of a broken seal and watch as the **reinforced latch arm swings wide**, now **free of the cage’s hanging rig**.

The cage rocks, no longer tethered from above. Still held by side supports—but now?  
**Loosened. Exposed. One good push or pull could break it open.**

---

Tashigi sees the shift and whispers:

&gt; “You got it?”

You don’t even look up.

&gt; “It never stood a chance.”

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro blinks.

&gt; “...He just unlocked the cage.  
With *fruit juice.*”

Nami: “I’m not sure whether to thank him or report him to the Science Division.”

Chopper: “He’s *amazing!*”

Vivi’s hand touches the cage’s edge. She feels it.

&gt; Loose.

She turns to the others and nods once.

&gt; *“Get ready.”*

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- **Cage Lock: Unlatched. Free.**  
- The bars are still solid, but the cage is now **ready to open or break with help.**  
- Straw Hats: Primed. Zoro and Nami look ready to assist.  
- Tashigi: Still watching your back. Blade up. No interruptions yet.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Motion to Zoro. “Kick it.” Let raw power break the rest open. He’s got the legs.}  
2. {Have Tashigi slice the now-free connecting latch—completely disengage the cage.}  
3. {Build a juice platform below the cage. If it opens wrong, give them something to land on.}  
4. {Climb atop the cage. Use your baton to knock the loosened top free.}  
5. {Signal everyone inside—“Push.” It’ll take all of them, but they can break it open with weight and timing.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - ​Hold out my arm. If they can get the door opened, try to catch them.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “Come on, kids. I’ve got you.”**

**🎲 Straw Hat Coordination – (Zoro +2, Nami +1, Vivi +2, Chopper +1) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**🎯 Outcome: The team inside sees your signal. They force the cage open from within. You brace—and *you catch them*. Kiwi-soaked, bruised, but heroic.**

---

You lower yourself slightly, feet wide, arms out, and brace against the slick metal of the cage platform.

&gt; “Alright...  
Let’s go, kids.”

You hold your arm out toward the caged crew like a lifeguard waiting at the deep end of a very stupid pool.

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro nods at you once.  
Then shoves his shoulder into the side of the gate—**metal groaning** as the now-unlatched section **buckles**.

Nami jams her heel into the gap with a loud grunt, shoving upward like she’s kicking a tax form off a desk.  
Vivi and Chopper **pull from the inside**, while Zoro drives forward again—

&gt; *KRK-KRAKK!*

The latch gives.

The door **flies open**—not gracefully, but *defiantly*—and in a half-fall, half-scramble:

&gt; **They spill out.**

Zoro lands on one leg and spins sideways to absorb the force.  
Nami nearly stumbles, and **you grab her arm**, pulling her forward.  
Vivi doesn’t hesitate—she **dives**, and you **catch her cleanly**, cradling her for just a breath before setting her down.

Chopper lands like a cat.

Luffy?

Still slumped in the back.

&gt; But breathing. Twitching. **Stirring.**

---

Tashigi’s eyes widen as the cage empties.

&gt; “You *caught them.* All of them.”

You grin, a little winded.

&gt; “Had to. I’m a teacher.”

---

**Behind you, in the water:**

The Banana Gators **roar**.

They realize **dinner just left the cage.**

They’re turning.

Fast.

---

**📝 Tactical Status:**

- **Cage is open. Straw Hats (minus Luffy) are free and armed with awareness.**  
- Vivi is **safe. Breathing. Strong.**  
- Luffy is still inside—but showing signs of waking.  
- Gators are **reacting. Closing in.**  
- Juice waterfall still flows above.  
- Tashigi is guarding the winch, sword drawn.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Dive into the cage. Wake Luffy. Now. The crew needs their wild card.}  
2. {Begin forming a juice wall between the Gators and the platform. You’ll hold them.}  
3. {Yell: “Up the waterfall! Go!” Start evacuating the crew, Luffy last.}  
4. {Toss a juice bomb into the Gator pit. Scatter them—hard.}  
5. {Ask Zoro: “Can you carry Straw Hat?” Coordinate for a clean, fast evac.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - That's a Seastone cage, I ain't going in there. You got the other kid, green? Stand defensively between Tashigi, the rest of the crew, and the Bananagators.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 5 Selected – “I ain’t stepping foot in that Seastone tomb. Green guy, you’re up.”**

**🎲 Defensive Stand – (Eatone +2 Juice Combat Readiness, +1 Baton Braced, +1 Environmental Awareness) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: Zoro bolts into the cage without hesitation. You plant yourself like a damn adult against a trio of reptilian nightmares. You are the wall between predators and your evac.**

---

You throw your arm out to stop Tashigi from moving forward, eyes locked on the Gator pit, and shout low and sharp to the swordsman now standing beside you:

&gt; “That’s a Seastone cage. I ain’t stepping in.  
**You** got the other kid—**Green.**”

Zoro locks eyes with you.

&gt; “On it.”

No questions. No sass. Just motion.

He **vaults the twisted cage door** with the ease of someone who's done this a hundred times, one hand grabbing the edge, the other already reaching for Luffy’s collar.

Inside, you hear the rasp of steel on metal as he adjusts the hilt at his side.

&gt; “Hey, Captain. Time to wake up. We got work to do.”

---

Meanwhile, you step forward.

One boot splashes on the slick metal. Your **baton comes up**, Seastone tip gleaming in the dim light.

Your juice hand flicks once—**three droplets fly out** and harden mid-air into **suspended tripwires**, thin as silk and ten times as sticky.

&gt; **You are the wall.**

Behind you:  
- **Tashigi**, sword up, eyes scanning.  
- **Nami**, holding Chopper like a grenade with antlers.  
- **Vivi**, shoulder squared, silent but iron-backed.

---

**Below you:**

The Banana Gators **lurch forward**, jaws wide.

One **leaps upward**, nearly catching the edge of the platform.  
Another **circles wide**, preparing to flank.

They’re coming.

&gt; And you?

You plant your feet, lift your baton.

&gt; “Let’s see how you handle a fruit you can’t swallow.”

---

**📝 Combat Status:**

- **Zoro is inside the cage retrieving Luffy.**  
- **You are between the crew and the Gators.**  
- **Juice tripwires active.**  
- **Gators are closing fast.**  
- **Evac path (juice waterfall): open and active.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Launch a juice blast directly at the leading Gator’s eyes—blind it, stagger the others.}  
2. {Let the first Gator hit the tripwire, then strike when it’s tangled. Clean takedown.}  
3. {Order Tashigi: “Get them up the waterfall. I’ll hold the line.”}  
4. {Begin freezing the platform beneath the Gators with sticky pulp. Make it harder to leap.}  
5. {Wait. Brace. Let them come—and counter hard.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Maybe I can scare them off. Prepare multiple droplets of Kiwi Juice in the air, and launch them like micro flechettes of very expired pepper spray at the surfaced gators.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 1 Selected – “Fruit-Flavored War Crime: Citrus Flechette Edition.”**  
**Tone: Controlled Ferocity | Action: Kiwi Blitz**  
**🎲 Juice Attack Roll – (Eatone +2 Fruit Weaponization, +1 Pressure Modulation, +1 Blinding Acidity) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Gator Resistance Roll – (Banana Gator +2 Tough Hide, -2 Sensitive Eyes/Nostrils, -1 Surprise) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**✅ Outcome: Your micro-flechettes strike with brutal precision. You don’t just hurt them—you **scatter** them. One flails. One *screams*. The others **panic**. You are, now and forever, the **Juice of God.**

---

You exhale slowly, lift your off-hand, and let the pressure rise.

&gt; *Kiwi juice orbs—six of them—float mid-air*  
&gt; Each no larger than a marble. Each pulsing faintly with volatile citrus rage.

You calculate trajectory—**eyes, nostrils, open maws.**  
Then—*flick*.

&gt; “Time to sting.”

You fire.

The droplets **sharpen mid-flight**, congealing into tiny acidic flechettes—**pulp-loaded with sour enzymes and astringent burn**, each one carrying the **chemical vengeance of a poorly refrigerated fruit smoothie left in the sun.**

---

**Impact:**

- First Gator: Direct hit to the left eye. It **screeches**, thrashing in the water, tail slamming the pit wall.
- Second: Hit across its upper gums and inner nostrils. **Chokes violently.** Submerges in a panic swirl.
- Third: Sees the splash, smells the air—and **bails**. Full tail-turn retreat into the deeper current.

For a moment, the entire pit **erupts in chaos**, water splashing, chains shaking, foam flying. The cage itself sways with the backlash.

---

Tashigi stares.

&gt; “You *pepper-sprayed an apex predator.*”

&gt; “Not my first faculty meeting.”

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro now has Luffy **over his shoulder**, and is climbing out with the easy athleticism of a man who *bench-presses ghosts for fun*.  
Luffy murmurs something. Still half-conscious.

&gt; “Smells... like breakfast…”

---

**📝 Combat Update:**

- Three Banana Gators: **Neutralized. Blinded. Disoriented.**  
- Luffy: Being carried out of the cage by Zoro  
- You: **Still standing in defense.**  
- The crew: Safe behind you, fully aware this is **go-time**.  
- Juice waterfall: Still flowing. Still the escape route.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal the crew. “Now. Up the waterfall. Go.” Prioritize evac. You’ll go last.}  
2. {Assist Zoro—form a juice platform for his jump. Luffy's heavy. Make it smooth.}  
3. {Prepare a parting shot—line up one last juice cluster to detonate as a full-pit smokescreen.}  
4. {Back up slowly, baton raised—cover the crew as they begin escaping.}  
5. {Ask Tashigi to head up first with Vivi and Chopper. Divide protection and direction.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Look around for Smoker. Is he in another room? Also, where's crocodile?

OOC: Sanji may have sprung his Mr. prince gambit, unaware of what's going on below.

**✅ Outcome: Smoker’s not in this room—**but you now have a strong sense of where he might be. As for Crocodile? He’s off-stage… but the **air has shifted.** Something’s *coming.*

---

You stand, breathing deep, acid still tingling your palm, eyes scanning the platform.

You glance to Tashigi, who’s standing guard at the rear. You speak low:

&gt; “Where’s your captain?”

She blinks, then curses under her breath.

&gt; “Not here. This was the Straw Hats’ cage only.”

She looks toward a dark tunnel near the opposite end of the pit—previously sealed with a grated iron gate, now slightly ajar.

&gt; “Smoker must be in the **secondary cell block.** That access tunnel links to Crocodile’s *personal holding chamber.*  
He keeps ‘high-value threats’ away from his spectacles.”

You frown.

&gt; “And where’s Crocodile?”

That’s when it hits you. Not sound. Not vibration.

&gt; **Pressure.**

The **air changes** again, dry and hot.  
The scent of sand, faint but rising.  
Your hair shifts. The **juice on your skin tightens**, reacting instinctively to what’s coming.

Tashigi’s eyes narrow.

&gt; “He’s back.”

---

**OOC Update:**  
Sanji, per canon, has just triggered his **Mr. Prince gambit**. He's in the casino above, manipulating enemy agents and calling Crocodile away.

**Canon Divergence Trigger: LOW.** Sanji's distraction might not work now that **you’ve altered the timing**.

---

**📝 Tactical Intel Update:**

- **Smoker is *not* here**. Likely held in a **secondary chamber** across the pit. Accessible—but **not safely**.  
- **Crocodile is returning.** You can feel it. You may have **seconds** before he reappears.  
- **Evac path is open**, but time is **very limited**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Evac everyone. Immediately. No detours. You’ll deal with Smoker *later*.}  
2. {Send Tashigi with the Straw Hats. *You* go for Smoker. Solo op.}  
3. {Signal Zoro—ask him to take Luffy up, then join you for a two-man rescue run.}  
4. {Delay. Prep juice tripwires and traps for Crocodile at the chamber entrance. One shot ambush.}  
5. {Call out loud: “Warlord’s coming. Move!” Drop the teacher voice. Rise into full command.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit. I look at Tashigi with wide eyes. He's coming. Your CO's going to have to wait.

Frantically motion to the rest to huddle up around me, and start conjuring a large puddle of kiwi juice at my feet.

**✅ Outcome: Your instincts fire at maximum capacity. The crew rallies around you. Juice floods the platform. **Evacuation is *imminent***—and this is going to be *messy, heroic,* and *damn citrusy.***

---

&gt; “Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh *SHIT—*”

You don’t scream it—you *breathe it*, like a prayer, like a man about to cast a final exam into a bonfire.

Your head snaps to Tashigi.

&gt; “He’s coming.  
**Your CO’s gonna have to wait.**”

Tashigi doesn’t hesitate.

She doesn’t question.  
She **nods**.

You spin to the Straw Hats—Zoro now carrying Luffy, Nami clutching Chopper, Vivi wide-eyed but clear-headed.

&gt; “Huddle up! Now! CLOSE!”

You slam your palm into the floor and pour every ounce of will, fear, instinct, and **righteous juice** into the surface.

&gt; **FWOOOOM—**

A **puddle explodes outward**, growing like a living, viscous lake.  
It glows faintly green, thickening at the edges, **slick but stabilizing**, congealing into a **cushioned disc** wide enough for everyone.

Your shoes begin to slide.  
The air smells like **fruit panic and ozone**.

---

The crew piles in:

- Zoro grunts, steadying Luffy and himself as he plants his boots.  
- Nami crouches, one arm around Chopper, the other grabbing Vivi.  
- Tashigi stands at the edge—sword ready—**facing the incoming tunnel.**

She looks back.

&gt; “You good?”

&gt; “No. But I’ve got **tenured panic training.**”

---

From the tunnel:  
The sand *whispers*.  
The air gets *hotter*.  
You hear **footsteps. Slow. Measured. Death on a coffee break.**

&gt; **Crocodile.**

---

**📝 Tactical State:**

- Everyone is now on the **evac puddle.**  
- Juice surge: Fully powered.  
- Crocodile: **Seconds away** from visual.  
- Smoker: Still imprisoned, elsewhere.  
- Option to launch **juice-slide evacuation** is **ready now.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Trigger the puddle. Launch the whole group up the waterfall in a high-pressure escape wave.}  
2. {Delay for two more seconds. If Crocodile gets close enough, blind him with a ceiling trap before you go.}  
3. {Yell to Tashigi—“Come on, now!” Pull her onto the puddle and **evac everyone, immediately.**}  
4. {Lock eyes with Crocodile as he enters. “Sorry. Vacation’s over.” THEN launch.}  
5. {Give the Straw Hats a push. Send them first. You and Tashigi stay to cover the retreat.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - what are you going to do with a sword? Get in here! Pull Tashigi by the shoulder into the disc of juice, and then have it erupt like a reverse waterfall, an emerald elevator.

I can swim through it easily. Focus on pushing the others up.

**🎲 Crocodile’s Perception – (+2 Awareness, -1 Tunnel Distance, -2 Emotional Investment in Monologue Timing) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**✅ Outcome: You pull Tashigi in *just in time*. The platform erupts in a blinding emerald geyser. You swim like Poseidon with a lesson plan. Everyone launches. Crocodile arrives **just** late enough to eat pulp and rage.**

---

&gt; “What are you going to do with a *sword*?! This isn’t a duel—it’s a damn *evac drill!*”

Tashigi’s lips part in protest—but you don’t wait.

&gt; You **grab her shoulder** and yank.

She lands with a thud on the **thick disc of juice**, and you slam your palm downward again—

&gt; “EVERYONE HOLD ON!”

---

The puddle **explodes**.

Not up—not like a geyser.

&gt; **Like a reverse waterfall,** funneled and focused, a **vertical emerald elevator** wrapped in spinning rings of juice, pressure-locked into a spiraling chute.

You dive into it as it forms, legs sliding upward, arms thrusting down—

&gt; *swimming against your own power*, legs kicking like a torpedo as you push the others upward—

- **Zoro** braces Luffy on his back, half-surfing the juice surge.
- **Nami shrieks**, gripping Chopper and Vivi as they rocket up the stream.
- **Tashigi** lands in a crouch beside you—then steadies herself and helps brace the lift's walls from within.
- **You** push from below, teeth grit, body half-dissolved in fruit force.

&gt; *The whole world tilts into green and roar.*

---

**Behind you—just as the last of your boot clears the platform:**

&gt; **Crocodile emerges.**

Coat billowing. Hook gleaming.

He sees only the **tail end of a fruit-powered miracle**, the last trace of an emerald flash—

&gt; **and the slap of a puddle in his face.**

He stands there, blinking fruit acid out of his eyes as the ceiling traps **burst**, raining citrus shrapnel into his freshly shaved villain ego.

&gt; “...What the—”

---

You all **erupt into the hallway above**, landing in a heap of bodies, steam, and pulp.

- **Luffy rolls off Zoro’s back, groaning.**
- **Nami coughs, soaked but whole.**
- **Chopper shakes juice out of his fur.**
- **Vivi just breathes.**
- **Tashigi collapses into a half-sitting crouch, sword across her lap.**

And you?

&gt; You stumble forward, soak-dripping, lungs burning, pulse jackhammering.

Then straighten.

&gt; “Okay. That was a *lot*.”

---

**📝 Tactical Outcome:**

- Entire crew: **Successfully evacuated** to the floor above Rain Dinners’ prison chamber.  
- Crocodile: **Arrived too late**. Furious. Soaked. Citrus-blinded.  
- You: **Exhausted**, but functioning. Juice reserves strained but active.  
- The battle below? No longer yours.

**🎲 Tashigi’s Command Response – (+2 Leadership, +1 Trust in You) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**✅ Outcome: You flood the vent hard. The backpressure **douses the tunnel** in acidic, traction-killing citrus sludge. Crocodile is **momentarily blinded and enraged.** Tashigi takes the order—**and leads the crew out.** You're now the **last line.**

---

Your legs are trembling. Your arms sting. The citrus in your veins feels *used*, but your mind burns with one command:

&gt; “Flood the damn tunnel.”

You throw your arms toward the **vent you just blasted out of**, and **with the force of a firehose**, you unleash the last of your **pressurized kiwi reservoir**.

The green tide **roars back down** the vent, flooding the metal chute, **sloshing over broken trap triggers and walls**, and finally **splashes out at Crocodile’s feet like a tropical tidal wave.**

&gt; *SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHK—*

The juice **hits him square in the face**—again.  
And this time? You hear it. The **sizzle** of citrus meeting sand.  
The hiss of *ego damage*.  
The growl of **humiliation**.

&gt; “—WHO IS DOING THIS?!”

His voice booms up the shaft, thunderous and drenched.

---

You spin and jab a finger at Tashigi.

&gt; “GET THEM UP AND GO!  
I’LL COVER YOU!”

For a split second, she doesn’t move.

Then she **snaps to it**.

&gt; “Straw Hats! On your feet! Move now—north corridor!”

She grabs Vivi and helps Nami lift Luffy as Zoro staggers to his feet, nodding once at you.

&gt; “Don’t die, pineapple.”

Chopper scampers, looking back with wet eyes.

Tashigi stops once at the hallway’s bend and looks back.

&gt; “We’ll meet at the palace! Don’t be stupid!”

Then they’re **gone**—footsteps echoing down a stone hallway into **open Alabasta sun**.

---

You’re alone.  
Juice dripping from your fingertips.  
A vent hissing with returning wrath.

&gt; Crocodile is climbing.  
&gt; And he is **pissed.**

---

**📝 Tactical Status:**

- Crew: **Escaping.** Tashigi is leading them out.  
- You: **Alone. Spent. Still dangerous.**  
- Crocodile: **Climbing up the flooded vent**, citrus-blinded, sand boiling.  
- Next move is **yours alone.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Set traps. Juice tripwires, slick floors, anything to stall him before he breaches.}  
2. {Climb. Get distance. Regroup later. You did your job. You’re not dying for drama.}  
3. {Wait at the top of the shaft, baton drawn. Just one hit. Make it count.}  
4. {Leave a pulpy, acidic parting gift. Overcharge the vent. Burn and blind him before you go.}  
5. {Brace yourself. Take a deep breath. “Let’s go, warlord.” You’re standing your ground.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Pineapple?!

Option X - attempt to follow the path Tashigi and co went down. Only to lose their trail. I... I don't have a map on me. It wouldn't have hurt her to wait another second...

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option X Selected – “Pineapple?! Wait—Tashigi—*where the hell did you go?*”**  
**Tone: Post-Adrenaline Comedown | Action: Attempted Regroup + Sad Lost Fruit Energy**

**🎲 Emotional Roll – (Eatone +2 Righteous Frustration, -1 Betrayed by Speed, +1 Tactical Humility) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You follow their path... for a bit. But the trail splits, and you're left in the quiet aftermath of your hero moment, slightly sticky, mostly alone, and wondering if “Pineapple” is a slur now.**

---

&gt; “*Pineapple?!*”

You sputter as the **last green traces of the juice fall from your sleeves**, still pulsing from the effort of the escape.  
You lurch down the corridor after them, feet half-sliding, baton still wet with adrenaline.

The sounds of the Straw Hats, of Tashigi's sharp commands, are already fading.  
You skid around the next bend—

&gt; Nothing.

Just **two branching hallways**, both dark.  
Both sloping upward.  
Both vaguely citrus-slick from your earlier flood.

You frown. Hard.

&gt; “It wouldn’t have killed her to wait **another damn second**...”

You run a few steps into one passage. Pause. Backtrack. Try the other.

Still **no footprints**, no voices. Just the slow **drip of retreating water**, the faint **shiver of residual fear** still clinging to the walls.

You stop.  
Put your hands on your knees.  
Exhale.

&gt; “I save them, I catch them, I tank *Banana Gators*, I flood a warlord’s hallway like a busted juice bar,  
and I still end up **alone** with no map, no backup, and now I’m the *pineapple* guy?”

Your voice echoes.  
Mocking.  
Your citrus-scented echo fades into silence.

---

**No sign of the crew. No sign of Crocodile—yet.**

But you are, for now, alone.  
**Safe-ish. Exhausted. Alive.**

- Health: Bruised but not broken

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Sit. Breathe. Rehydrate. You can’t help anyone if you collapse.}  
2. {Start leaving small juice markers as you explore. Make your own map.}  
3. {Call out, softly. “Tashigi? Vivi?” Just in case someone hears.}  
4. {Press forward. You’re finding a way out. One way or another.}  
5. {Duck into a side hall and hide. Let your juice recover. You might need it soon.}

**🎲 Corridor Complexity – (Rain Dinners Basement +2 Maze Design, -1 Open Doors from Escape, -1 Juice Presence) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: You pick up the trail. It’s faint—*not perfect*—but it’s enough. You push forward through the back halls of Rain Dinners, on the **heels of your squad**… still sticky, still sore, and still very much alive.**

---

You turn slowly, eyes narrowing, nose sniffing like you’re tracking down a bad cafeteria prank.

&gt; “Okay… I *was* leaving juice behind. At least a little.”

You crouch low to the smooth tile floor, trailing your fingers along the baseboard.

Then—**you find it.**

A thin, faint smear of **viscous green** sliding out from the edge of a hallway turn. Too controlled to be from a fight. Too clean to be anything *but* yours.

You **grin. Weakly.**

&gt; “Knew you’d come through, Kiwi Trail.”

---

You push forward, following the subtle citrus slick:

- A droplet *here*, on a doorframe.  
- A palm smear *there*, from when Nami probably steadied herself.  
- An empty hallway, but the faint acidic scent of **motion** still lingers.

You move faster.

Your legs ache.  
Your core *burns*.  
But your **willpower holds.**

---

At the next junction, you stop.  
One smear curves **left**, but it’s thin.  
The other—barely visible—heads **right**, but with more streaks. **Dragging footprints.**

&gt; “Zoro’s boots.”

You smile.  
The **trail leads on**.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- Trail Found: **Yes**  
- Direction: **Right Hallway**, mild uphill slope  
- Sound: Distant—maybe voices. Maybe movement.  
- You are still **alone**, but getting closer.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Keep following the trail—quietly, quickly. You’re catching up.}  
2. {Leave a small juice sign on the wall—if anyone comes looking for *you*, they’ll know.}  
3. {Call out, once. Quietly. “Zoro? Vivi?” Just in case you’re close.}  
4. {Prepare a juice pulse as a flare if you need help. Not now—but soon.}  
5. {Move carefully. You’re not *that* far ahead of Crocodile. He could still cut you off.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Keep moving. Crocs a sand demon. He probably has FTS travel - faster than sand. I gotta get out of here, pronto

**🎲 Crocodile Proximity Roll – (+2 Sand Travel, -2 Delay from Vent-Flood, -1 Citrus Blindness) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**✅ Outcome: You stay ahead. Just barely. Crocodile may be able to travel through sand—but you’re cutting corners, hitting the right trail, and **outpacing his line of pursuit.****

---

You break into a jog—then a full sprint.

&gt; *Clack clack clack* — your boots hammer against the slick stone floor as the corridor tightens around you.  
&gt; *Faster than sand.*  
&gt; *FTS.*  
&gt; You hate how clever that sounded.  
&gt; You hate even more that it’s probably **true**.

---

You round a corner—and catch another flash of **juice** on a brass door latch.  
It’s smudged. Hand-shaped.  
Someone braced themselves here.

You slam your hand against the door and burst through—

&gt; Another hallway.  
&gt; This one **narrower**, but **brighter.**  
&gt; Above you? The faint glimmer of **sunlight through vent grates.**

---

The casino’s above you now.  
You can feel the shift in air.  
And more than that—

&gt; **No sand.**  
This is **stonework**, not dunes.  
Crocodile would need to slow down to follow.

You keep running.

---

Somewhere behind you, you swear you hear a hiss.  
Not air. Not a gator.  
**Something dry. Ancient. Fast.**

&gt; You don’t look back.

---

**📝 Tactical Update:**

- You are officially **ahead of Crocodile**.  
- You've reached **casino-adjacent architecture**—the edge of Rain Dinners’ public floor system.  
- Exit = Close.  
- Sunlight = Visible.  
- Sand Warlord = Still on your trail.

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Look for stairs or signage. Time to surface. Time to vanish into the crowd.}  
2. {Kick open a door. Any door. You’ll escape *through* the damn kitchen if you have to.}  
3. {Slam a juice seal over the door behind you. Might hold sand. Might not. Worth a shot.}  
4. {Call out again. If the Straw Hats are close, you’re done playing lost.}  
5. {Dive into the next vent shaft and start climbing. You're almost out. Go vertical.}

**🎲 Navigation Memory Roll – (Eatone +2 Spatial Recall, +1 Citrus Scent Mapping, +1 Educated Guesswork) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎯 Outcome: You spot a familiar decorative column, then a broken neon sign… then the scent of fried kebab and overpriced alcohol hits you like a reunion hug. You’re on the right path. The **Banana Gator Racing Bar** is just around the bend.**

---

You slow down for just a second—not to breathe, not to rest—

&gt; **To think.**

&gt; “Okay. Neon pillars. Left turn after the water pipe.  
Right before the *terrible mural of Crocodile posing like a playboy centerfold.*”

You scan the hallway—  
There.  
The wall curves just slightly.  
The floor pattern shifts—**tacky carpet** over cold tile.

And then?

&gt; **The gator logo.**  
Worn. Scuffed. But familiar.

You turn—

&gt; And there it is.

The gaudy, ridiculous **Banana Gator Racing Lounge**, somehow untouched by the chaos beneath.  
The fake sand on the floor still shimmers.  
The cocktail lights still blink.  
The **Snack Pack betting board** glows gently behind the bar.

You slow down.  
Limp into the space.  
&gt; “I’m back...”

The bartender—a different one now—looks up.

&gt; “You... uh... want another daiquiri, sir?”

You blink.

&gt; “I think I’ll take mine... to go.”

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- You are now in the **casino proper**, at the Banana Gator Racing Lounge  
- No Crocodile in sight. You’ve **bought yourself space and time**  
- The Straw Hats? Still ahead. But not far  
- Rain Dinners is **fragile** now. The wrong move could still draw attention

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Leave through the front. Walk out like a guest. Bold. Brazen. Maybe it’ll work.}  
2. {Cut through the staff corridor behind the bar. You know there’s a route to the docks.}  
3. {Ask the bartender if he’s seen a group of weirdly dressed people plus one Marine run by.}

---

You approach the bar, **dripping citrus**, looking like the result of a keg stand gone wrong and a fruit fight with God.

&gt; “Sorry, did I miss the final race?”

The bartender pauses.

You lean in, pointing at your **soaked, semi-dignified self** with theatrical flair.

&gt; “Knocked over a *barrel* of jungle juice in my suite while reaching for my coat.  
Whole thing went *whoooosh*. I’ve been cleaning up for half an hour.”

The bartender blinks.  
Then slowly sets down the glass he was drying.

&gt; “...That explains the smell.”

&gt; “It’s *Kiwi forward.* Boutique.”

&gt; “Uh-huh.”

---

He leans in a bit, lowering his voice as he nods toward the **southwestern service door**.

&gt; “We had a weird group come through like ten minutes ago.  
Kid with a straw hat, tall guy carrying him like luggage. Girl with blue hair. Looked rough.”

&gt; “They say where they were going?”

&gt; “Didn’t stop to chat, but… pretty sure I heard the blue-haired girl ask someone how to get to the docks.  
Northwest gate. Hidden stair behind the blackjack tables.”

He lowers his voice further.

&gt; “Don’t tell my boss I told you. I’m technically on *sandstorm lockdown service mode.*”

You grin.

&gt; “Your secret’s safe with the pineapple.”

&gt; “What?”

&gt; “Nothing.”

- Casino floor: still bustling. Still dangerous if Crocodile is shadowing through staff corridors

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head straight for the blackjack tables. Find the hidden stair. You’ve got a boat to catch.}  
2. {First: swipe a drink from the bar. Citrus deserves a citrus chaser.}  
3. {Blend into the casino crowd. Move slow. Don’t draw attention.}  
4. {Ask the bartender one last thing—“You seen a Marine captain? Chain-smoker. Real grumpy.”}  
5. {Leave a Beri tip on the counter, then sprint. You’re done being subtle.}

---

You glance toward the blackjack tables…  
Then glance **away.**

&gt; “Nah.  
Let’s go through the *front*.”

You roll your shoulders.  
Straighten your juice-stained collar.  
Wipe a pulp smear off your cheek with all the grace of a man who just held off apex predators and a warlord with the power of fruit.

&gt; “Let them chase shadows.”

You stride through the **casino lounge**, passing tourists cheering at the banana gator betting boards, no one giving you a second glance beyond the smell.

**Security staff?** Distracted.  
**Dealers?** Still calling bets.  
**Patrons?** Drunk and rich and uninterested in your drama.

The **front hall glitters ahead**, framed by towering gold-stone arches and the spinning doors to Rainbase's main plaza.

You pass a pair of **Baroque Works agents**—suited, earpieces, annoyed.

One is muttering into a snail mic:

&gt; “—No, sir, the targets were last seen moving northwest—yes, the stairwell near the blackjack pit.  
No, *not* the guy from the bar. He’s gone. Probably a decoy—”

You walk **right past them.**

They don’t even blink.

---

**Outside:**

The air is **hot**, but open.  
The crowd is bustling with street vendors, guards, travelers, dock workers.  
And on the far side?

You see the outer market wall—**the docks beyond it.**

You’re free.

**And you’re now on the *outside* of the trap.**

---

**OOC Tactical Note:**  
Crocodile’s agents are now **fully focused on the Straw Hat + Tashigi escape** via the northwest gate.  
You’ve looped out wide and have the chance to **flank, regroup, or intercept** without resistance—for now.

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- You’re outside Rain Dinners.  
- You’re ahead of the Straw Hats’ likely egress point.  
- You are unpursued and **entirely off Crocodile’s radar** for the moment.  
- Time to make your next move **count.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head for the docks. Wait. Intercept the crew as they emerge.}  
2. {Find high ground near the northwest gate. Be their overwatch.}  
3. {Ask a vendor casually if they’ve seen a bunch of damp weirdos with swords and antlers.}  
4. {Prep a juice trap in the alley near the gate. If agents pursue, they’ll eat pulp.}

---

&gt; “If I’m going to get murdered in five minutes,  
I might as well leave a message for whoever finds the body.”

You jog across the plaza, eyes scanning, citrus scent still trailing behind you like a sad, juicy cloud.

Then—there.

&gt; **A public Den Den Mushi booth.**  
Dusty. Sun-faded. But open.

You hustle inside, slap a few coins into the port, and twist the dial like you’re playing **cursed roulette**. The snail sluggishly lifts its eyes, bleary from disuse.

&gt; “Come on, come on…”

You dial your **home-island Marine office**—the junior officer you’ve had drinks with, the one who owes you for helping his idiot brother pass his math final.

The snail **blinks**.  
The receiver **crackles**.

&gt; *Ch-kkkk—Connecting—Khhh—Rainbase Central Outbound—please hold—*

And then—

&gt; *click*  
&gt; *BZZZZZZZZZZT*

Dead line.  
The snail **shudders**, shrinks into its shell, and **shuts down.**

A little red tag flaps down in front of your face:

&gt; **“EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN — ALL OUTBOUND LINES JAMMED PER CITY COMMAND”**

You stare.  
One eye twitches.

&gt; “Yup. There it is.”

---

**OOC Update:**  
Crocodile has activated **Rainbase-wide lockdown protocols**—all **external communications are now jammed**.  
The city is becoming a **closed box**, designed to crush and bury the threat inside.

**You, unfortunately, are the threat.**

- You: **Alone, outside Rain Dinners.** Free. But for how long?

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Sprint for the docks. Find them, warn them—now. This is your last open corridor.}  
2. {Look for a quiet spot to hide and recover. You may need to outlast the lockdown.}  
3. {Find a local and bluff a Marine ID. Maybe *someone* can get you to a secure line.}  
4. {Search for a boat. If the worst happens, you need a personal exfil plan.}

---

&gt; “Northwest… northwest… where the hell is *northwest?!*”

You spin in a circle like a citrus-powered compass needle with low battery.  
The sun’s in the sky—but high enough that your usual “shadow trick” is basically useless.

&gt; “Okay. I’ll just… go **that** way.”

You point dramatically toward an alley between two restaurants—smelling vaguely of fried fish and questionable shellfish.

Then you **run.**

---

The alley bends west, then slopes down toward the sea.  
Palm fronds whip past your face.  
A startled old woman yells at you in a dialect you don’t recognize.  
You nearly bowl over a cart of plastic-wrapped grilled squid.

But then—

&gt; You spot a **dock.**

And more importantly?

&gt; You see **people.**

Not your people. Not yet.  
But **sailors. Vendors.** Market dwellers scattering.  
They’ve heard something’s wrong.  
They’re **nervous**.

You're just **a few streets off target.**

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Yo! I'm about to miss my boat! I flash a few beris. Anyone camel taxis able to get me to the main docks? Pretend to be a wealthy tourist

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **🎲 Option 2 Selected – “Yo! I’m About to Miss My Boat! Camel Taxi—Stat!”**  
**Tone: Haggard But High-Rolling Tourist | Action: Beri-Flashing Camel Extraction**  
**🎲 Bluff &amp; Bribe Roll – (Eatone +2 Fake Wealth, +1 Urgency, +1 Citrus Camouflage) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**🎲 Local Response – (+2 Camel Driver Hustle, +1 Fear of Rainbase Lockdown) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**✅ Outcome: You flash the cash, and three camel drivers appear like magic. You’re hoisted up and galloping toward the main docks in seconds—*just in time* to intercept the crew.**

---

You jog up to the nearest knot of vendors, trying to ignore the ache in your calves and the drying streaks of kiwi juice on your jacket.

&gt; “Yo! I’m about to miss my boat—hey, hey! Camel taxi, main docks? I’ll pay double! Triple if we make it before the sandstorm lockdown!”

You **flash a handful of Beri** like a desperate big spender on vacation.

For a second, the crowd just blinks.  
Then—a **young camel driver** with a scar over one brow and a salesman's grin pushes forward, hand raised.

&gt; “Triple? Sir, for triple we’ll get you there before your juice dries! Come, come—Prime Camel Express!”

Another two drivers jump in, trying to outbid him. You hop onto the nearest camel’s saddle—ignoring the citrus you leave behind.

&gt; “Main docks! NOW!”

The driver **whistles sharply** and the camel *lurches* forward, sprinting down the sunbaked road, weaving past startled vendors and scattering children.

**Street by street, you close the gap.**

The air thickens with **tension** and the taste of imminent lockdown.  
Patrols are moving, but your camel slides past them with an ease bought by *coin and chaos*.

---

Then—  
The camel rounds a corner.  
The **main docks** open before you.

And **there**, pushing toward the farthest pier—

- A blue-haired girl—**Vivi**.  
- A swordsman lugging a rubbery unconscious man—**Zoro and Luffy**.  
- Nami and Chopper, wild-eyed, nearly running.  
- And at their back, Tashigi, sword out, **watching the crowd for threats.**

You’re **maybe fifty meters away.**

&gt; “THAT’S THEM! GET ME TO THAT PIER!”

The driver cackles.

&gt; “Hold on, big spender!”

---

**📝 Status Update:**

- You are **seconds away** from rejoining the crew at the docks.  
- No Baroque Works agents in sight—yet.  
- Docks are still **open**—but patrols are moving in.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Dismount in full style. “Room for one more?” Join the escape crew.}  
2. {Throw extra Beri to your driver. “Scatter! Make noise—buy us thirty seconds!”}  
3. {Signal Tashigi and Vivi—“It’s me! Move faster!”}  
4. {Juice skate off the camel and into the crew, ready to blast any agents appearing.}  
5. {Quickly grab water and food from a pier stall for the group, just in case. You might need it.}

🌀 {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: Scene shift to Tashigi's group.

When the bounty hunter told her he'd buy them time, she quickly made off with Vivi and her entourage, expecting him to catch up. To her growing horror, he never appears. A clash of guilt, and duty to get Vivi and the Straw Hats to safety clash in her mind.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Scene Shift: Tashigi’s Group – Alabasta Docks, Moments Before Reunification]**  
**Tone: Fractured Focus | Theme: Guilt &amp; Duty on a Ticking Clock**

---

Tashigi’s boots **pound against the sunbaked planks** of the Rainbase docks, each step dragging a heavier weight behind it—not just the growing presence of Marines, tourists, and whispering Baroque agents in disguise…

…but the **suffocating silence** from behind.

&gt; *He said he’d cover us.*  
&gt; *Said he’d buy us time.*

She throws a sharp glance back toward the shimmering heat-haze of the city’s outer rim.  
No sign of him.  
Not a smear of citrus. Not a glint of soaked coat. Not even the sarcastic bark she’d come to find strangely reliable.

&gt; “Dammit... Cheng.”

---

**Zoro** grunts beside her, Luffy still slung like a sack of meat over his shoulder.

&gt; “We stopping for something?”  
&gt; “You left someone?”

Tashigi doesn’t answer at first.  
Just clenches her jaw and picks up speed.

**Nami**, panting as she pulls Chopper along, throws a sharp look.

&gt; “We don’t have time for dramatic hesitations, Marine.”

&gt; “I know that.”

Her voice is low. Controlled.  
Barely.

**Vivi** places a hand on Tashigi’s arm. It’s trembling—only slightly.

&gt; “He said he’d catch up.”  
&gt; “Maybe he already escaped by another route…”

Tashigi exhales through her teeth, eyes stinging—not from the sun.

&gt; “No. He would’ve said something. He’s not quiet. He’s *never quiet.*”

The group slows for half a breath.

A **guilt-laced silence** wraps around her like a collar.

&gt; *Did I leave him to die?  
Did I just… let that idiot sacrifice himself?*

And then, that cold, familiar voice in her mind: **&quot;Your duty is to the Princess.&quot;**

---

&gt; “Damn you, Cheng…”

But she keeps moving.  
Because the world doesn’t stop.  
Not for guilt.  
Not even for fruit-wielding teachers who bought them time they didn’t deserve.

---

**OOC: Tashigi currently believes Eatone may have fallen behind—or worse. Her decision to prioritize Vivi and the Straw Hats is weighing on her heavily.**  
**The scene is now *primed* for a dramatic reentry.**

Do you wish to **cut to your arrival**, or allow the scene to breathe a moment longer?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: still with Tashigi - he didn't catch up on the corridors. He didn't catch up outside the back of rain dinners. And now at the main rendezvous point, he still hasn't caught up. She got an innocent involved in her mess, and now used his life to save her own hide. Perhaps he's dead, being tortured for info, or worse 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Still with Tashigi – Docks of Rainbase]**  
**Tone: Heavy Guilt | Theme: A Marine’s Burden**

---

They’re **almost there**.

The end of the pier.

A waiting **supply boat** — still being loaded, unaware it may soon be the escape vessel for a pirate crew, a princess, and a rapidly unraveling Marine swordswoman.

Tashigi’s chest heaves—not from exertion. From the weight.  
From the image she can’t shake:

&gt; *Eatone—back turned—shoulders squared—fruit-juice dripping—facing Crocodile.*

The thought won't leave her.

She didn’t even *look back.*

---

She slows again—this time long enough for **Zoro** to notice.  
He gives her a sharp glance, jaw tightening.

&gt; “You dragging, or are we about to fight again?”

She doesn’t answer. Just stares ahead. And whispers:

&gt; “He didn’t make it.”

Nami spins around.

&gt; “What?”

&gt; “Eatone. He didn’t follow us through the corridors.  
Didn’t make it to the upper casino.  
Didn’t show at the plaza.  
And now—nothing. Still nothing.”

She grips the hilt of her sword hard enough her glove creaks.

&gt; “I got him involved.  
He was just a tourist. A bounty hunter on vacation.  
And I used his life to keep moving.”

---

**Vivi** steps closer, gently.

&gt; “He chose to help us. He *insisted.*”

&gt; “Because I let him.”

Tashigi’s voice wavers now. Barely.

&gt; “Because I gave him *the look*.  
The one Smoker gives me when I have to choose between stupid or brave.  
He followed me because I told him—without saying it—that if he didn’t, someone would die.”

Her voice drops to almost nothing.

&gt; “And maybe someone still did.”

---

**Silence.**  
Just the creaking of wood, the far-off calls of dockworkers.  
Even the Straw Hats don’t have a quip ready.

Not even **Zoro.**

For once, he looks almost… respectful.

&gt; “You sure he’s dead?”

She doesn’t answer.

Because right now, she isn’t sure of **anything**.

Except that she left someone behind.

And she may never forgive herself for it.

---

**OOC: Tashigi’s guilt is peaking. Her character is now emotionally compromised. If Eatone arrives soon, it will carry **maximum emotional impact.** Would you like to resume control and reenter now—or let this emotional thread develop further first?**

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: What do the straw hats think of the mysterious fruit man with Tashigi? Was he really a bounty hunter? Or was he an undercover marine? Either way, he seemed to have sacrificed himself to save them

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[OOC Scene: Straw Hats’ Thoughts – Post-Escape, Pre-Departure]**  
**Tone: Quiet Reflection | Theme: Confusion, Suspicion, Respect**

---

As they wait for the ship to finish loading, a strange hush has settled over the Straw Hats. The breeze carries the scent of salt, city heat, and citrus that’s still lingering in their hair and clothes.

&gt; The man who fought like a Marine.  
&gt; Spoke like a teacher.  
&gt; Threw juice like a madman.  
&gt; And vanished like a ghost.

---

**Nami**, seated on a crate beside Vivi, wipes kiwi pulp off her sleeve with a grimace.

&gt; “Okay, so—was he seriously a *schoolteacher*?”

She eyes Tashigi sideways.

&gt; “Because that man handled two gators, a Warlord’s trap, and a full room of gamblers like he ran the *world’s weirdest PTA meeting.*”

---

**Zoro**, arms crossed, silent for a long moment, finally grunts.

&gt; “He had Seastone.  
Not standard bounty hunter gear.”

&gt; “So… Marine?”

Zoro shrugs.

&gt; “Could’ve been. Or just smart. But…”

He looks out over the water, his one good eye narrowing.

&gt; “He was scared. The real kind. But he still stood between us and those gators.”

That’s the kind of bravery Zoro respects. The **quiet kind**. The **&quot;I’m probably going to die but I’m doing this anyway&quot;** kind.

---

**Chopper**, tucked under Nami’s arm, sniffs.

&gt; “I liked him. He smelled like vitamins and juice boxes.”

---

**Vivi** is silent. She’s been that way since they hit the dock.  
But when she finally speaks, it’s soft. Certain.

&gt; “He wasn’t a Marine. He wasn’t a pirate.  
But he was *a protector.* He saved us because he believed in what we were doing.”

She turns to Tashigi.

&gt; “Even if it cost him.”

---

And then there's **Luffy**—eyes still half-lidded, slumped in a makeshift bed of ropes and sacks. He hasn't said a word since waking up.

Until now.

He sits up. Slowly.

&gt; “He’s not dead.”

Everyone looks at him.

Luffy scratches his head, looks toward the city, and shrugs with casual certainty.

&gt; “Just feels like he’s still moving.”

---

**OOC Summary:**  
The Straw Hats are torn. They don’t know who Eatone was—or *what* he was.  
- **Nami** suspects undercover Marine or government.  
- **Zoro** respects the fight and doesn’t care about the label.  
- **Chopper** thinks he was cool.  
- **Vivi** is shaken, quietly reverent.  
- **Luffy**? Believes. No explanation. Just *feels it.*

They view him as someone who might’ve **sacrificed himself for them**—and whether that means they owe him, or that *he was one of them for a moment*, is something each is processing in their own way.

Would you like to **cut to Eatone’s dramatic arrival now**, or let the Straw Hats linger in that uncertainty a little longer?

&gt;&gt; USER: Meanwhile at the camel. 

I pat the driver, telling him to let me off early. If someone sees me with him, he might get stuck on a kill list. I approach the dock stealthily (in case of watching Baroque agents), and notice that Tashigi looks absolutely miserable for some reason. Odd (I have no idea why)

OOC: Usopp and Sanji rendezvous with the other straw hats

OOC: Player character controls dislogue, may have window to respond to NPCs

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Scene: Rainbase Docks – Moments Before the Crew’s Departure]**  
**Tone: Calm Before the Next Storm | Mood: Tense, Quietly Hopeful**

---

**You pat the camel driver on the arm** before the final stretch, the dock now visible down a gently sloped street littered with crates, squawking gulls, and the occasional guard barking vague lockdown orders.

&gt; “Let me off here.”

The driver blinks. “But sir—”

&gt; “If they spot you with me, you’re gonna end up on a Warlord’s kill list.”

You hand him the promised triple fare—and a little extra.

&gt; “Buy your camel something nice. Something not fermented.”

He salutes you like he has *any* idea who you are, then clicks his tongue and fades into the backstreets like a good NPC who wants to live.

---

You slip down the alleyways—**stealth mode** activated not by training, but by sheer stress-based instinct.  
A couple of fruit crates provide cover. You duck behind a fish stand.  
You *blend in*—sort of.

&gt; You reach the edge of the docks—just far enough to see the group boarding the ship.

And that’s when you notice **Tashigi**.

---

**She’s hunched forward**, half-sitting on a mooring post, gripping her sword like it’s the only thing keeping her spine intact.  
Eyes distant.  
Face carved with something heavy.

&gt; Guilt?

Weird.  
She got the princess out.  
The pirates are alive.  
She should be smug as hell.

&gt; But she looks *wrecked.*

---

Up the dock, **Sanji and Usopp** come skidding into view, Sanji panting, Usopp wide-eyed and gesturing like he just fought twenty people off with a ladle.

&gt; “There they are!” Usopp shouts. “I told you I knew where they’d be!”

Sanji ignores him.  
Looks to Nami first.  
Then Vivi.  
Then frowns.

&gt; “Where’s the pineapple guy?”

Nami opens her mouth to respond—  
But then Vivi’s head **snaps up.**  
She looks out toward the side pier.

Right.  
Toward **you**.

---

You now have a **window to act.**

Do you approach openly?  
Sneak up behind them?  
Yell something stupid?  
Wait for Tashigi to notice you?

**You are in control.**  
What's your move?
