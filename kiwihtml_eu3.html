<body lang="en-US" link="#000080" vlink="#800000" dir="ltr"><pre>&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - ...oh shit Blue!

Too weak to stand, too weak to launch a jet of juice, but enough to will my snaking river of juice to push me faster, faster, faster til I'm a barreling exotic flavored human torpedo.

I might arrive just in time to take a blow

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Human Torpedo of Justice]**  
**Scene: “Don’t You Touch My Kids”**  
**Tone: Raw Instinct | Mood: Desperate Impact, Bitter Timing**

---

The crowd doesn’t notice.

The chaos drowns everything.

Screams, sand, shouting, smoke—it all **blurs** as the four Baroque agents, disguised as royal guards, move in behind **Vivi**.

Their blades are **drawn low**, close to their cloaks. No grand attacks. Just **assassin’s work**.

Two steps from striking distance.

---

You round the rubble.

And you see it.

&gt; “...oh shit.”

Your voice barely escapes your throat.

But your body—

It *moves.*

---

You **command the juice.**  
Not to attack. Not to explode.

Just to **push.**

---

A slithering, concentrated **kiwi stream** erupts behind you, **tightening**, **pressurizing**—becoming a **hydraulic piston** aimed dead at destiny.

---

Your body, scraped and bruised, launches forward like a **slightly fruity cannonball**.

**Ribs screaming. Arms shaking. Mouth open in either rage or regret.**

You fly.

You fly in the **worst position** possible—limbs flailing, posture pathetic—

But your **aim?**

**Perfect.**

---

&gt; *WHAM.*

You **slam into the side** of the lead Baroque agent mid-swing, tackling him in a burst of citrus spray.

**He goes down hard.**

You crash through him into the second, sending both skidding into the dust, blades spinning into the sand.

---

The third stumbles back.

The fourth hesitates—too late.

---

You roll, bounce, *bounce again*, and come to a **wheezing, juice-slicked stop** between Vivi and the attackers.

Your body screams.

But you **throw your arm out**, protecting her with the only thing you have left: **presence.**

---

Vivi turns, wide-eyed.

&gt; “Eatone?!”

---

You don’t have breath for words.

But your message is clear.

---

&gt; *Not the kid.*

---

And now?

The Straw Hats are turning.

Sanji sees them.

Zoro’s sword is already halfway out.

**Too late for a clean kill. Too late for subtlety.**

Your ridiculous, heroic tackle has **blown their cover**, and the momentum has turned.

---

**OOC: You have successfully intercepted the surprise attack.  
Two Baroque agents down. Two more exposed.  
Straw Hats are reacting.  
Vivi is safe.  
You are at zero stamina.**

Would you like to:

1. {Stay down. Just watch it unfold. You’ve done enough.}  
2. {Say something to Vivi before you pass out again.}  
3. {Try to rise. Pathetic. Heroic. Hilarious.}  
4. {Attempt to summon a final, shaky Kiwi Elemental before losing consciousness.}

🌀 Final play, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Groan from the pain of headbutting someone in armor. At least the straw hats have them handled. I snake a stream of juice around Vivi as if I was circling the wagons, then curl around her like a particularly protective worm (or viper, if one were feeling charitable). I look up at her, wincing. I've... I've still got your back blue. As long as I'm still breathing.

A pause.

Well considering that I can't get up, it's more like I got your feet, rather than your back.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Kiwi Shield]**  
**Scene: “Feet, Back, Whatever It Takes”**  
**Tone: Painfully Honest | Mood: Ridiculous and Heartbreaking All at Once**

---

You’re lying in the dirt.

Your skull is ringing from the *headbutt into a breastplate maneuver* (Note to self: **never again**), and your ribs feel like a maraca in a blender.

But you're still there.

**Breathing.**

And **Vivi is alive.**

---

The Straw Hats explode into action behind you—

- **Zoro’s swords flash**, parrying and pinning the last two Baroque agents like he’s cutting wheat.  
- **Sanji flips into the air**, a boot connecting with a jaw that echoes across the plaza.  
- **Usopp** fires off a slingshot round that bursts in a blinding flash.  
- **Nami**, eyes burning, raises her Clima-Tact and channels a gust of wind to knock the last attacker into a broken stall.

---

You?

You just **groan**.

&gt; “Ughhhh... godsdamn armor helmets...”

You cough. **Something cracks.**  
Could be your pride.

You raise a **shaky finger**, and a **thin coil of kiwi juice** slithers from it, tracing the ground in a tight ring around Vivi. Like a moat. A barrier. A **final warning**.

Then you curl slightly closer, your battered body forming a squishy, wounded spiral near her legs.

&gt; “I’ve... I’ve still got your back, Blue.”

You wince hard, twitching from pain, still not looking directly at her.

&gt; “As long as I’m still breathing.”

You look up at her—

Vivi, blinking through tears. Shock. Relief.

You give her a weak, sideways grin.

---

&gt; “Well, considering I can’t get up...”

&gt; “...it’s more like I got your **feet**, rather than your back.”

---

That gets her.

A weak, exhausted **laugh** escapes her throat, even as the tears flow.  
She drops to her knees beside you, hands hovering—unsure where to touch, where it wouldn’t hurt.

&gt; “You absolute idiot…”

&gt; “My idiot.”

She leans forward, wrapping her arms **gently** around your shoulders as chaos still swirls at the edges of the plaza.

But not near her.

Not anymore.

---

**You did it.**

You made it in time.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has been emotionally and physically steadied.
- The Straw Hats have cleared the remaining agents.
- You are alive—barely—but your sacrifice **turned the tide.**
- Tashigi, still watching from above, smiles faintly through the blood.

&gt; *Maybe you’re not just a teacher after all.*

---

Would you like to fade out into unconsciousness with style—or stay conscious to witness the beginning of the final confrontation with Crocodile above?

&gt;&gt; USER: Maintain consciousness.

Kohza finally gets to Vivi.

A dry Luffy fisted ineffectively fights Crocodile

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Turning Tide]**  
**Scene: “Truth, Sand, and Stubbornness”**  
**Tone: Threadbare Resolve | Mood: The Tension Before the Final Blow**

---

You're lying on the cobblestones, half-curled around **Vivi**, **conscious only through sheer spite** and the sense of adult responsibility that refuses to die.

Your body is wrecked. You’re fairly certain at least **four major joints** are protesting their contracts.

But you’re **aware**.

**Watching. Listening.**

---

The dust settles around the plaza—at least for now.

The **Straw Hats** regroup in a loose perimeter, weapons drawn but no longer pressed. For once, the battlefield **pauses.**

**Kohza** finally shoves through the last of the crowd, his cloak torn, face cut and bruised from the riot.

He sees you first.

He falters—**unsure who the hell the green, fruit-smelling guy curled at Vivi’s ankles is.**

But then—

He sees **her.**

And she sees **him.**

---

&gt; “Kohza…”

&gt; “Vivi.”

It’s not a reunion.

It’s not even a moment of peace.

It’s **confirmation.**

That both of them are still alive. That they still remember what they fought for.

&gt; “I saw it,” he breathes, stepping closer. “I saw the agents. The lies. *Crocodile.*”

She nods—tears still fresh but *held back.*

&gt; “We can still stop this.”

&gt; “We just need to tell them. Together.”

---

The crowd watches, torn. Not fighting. Not moving. **Waiting.**

For a sign.

For a leader.

For truth.

---

---

**Above…**

**Luffy is punching sand.**

Over and over and over again.

**Fists slam through Crocodile’s chest**, his arms, his face—but it’s like hitting fog.

&gt; “GOMU GOMU NO—!”

**Swirl. Twist. Miss.**

Crocodile’s laughter **rings across the sky**.

&gt; “How does it feel?” he sneers. “To throw your whole strength... and never touch anything at all?”

He **slams a sand-covered fist** into Luffy’s side, sending him **tumbling across the rooftop**, coughing, spitting blood.

---

Below, Vivi looks up.

You look too.

She doesn’t cry.

She just **tenses**—watching Crocodile tower above her kingdom.

---

You shift slightly, enough to whisper.

&gt; “Dry…”

&gt; “His fruit…”

You cough hard. Acid climbs your throat.

&gt; “He’s made of sand… and you’re hitting him with fists.”

---

Nami, nearby, snaps her head toward you.

&gt; “You’ve seen him fight before?”

You nod. Barely.

&gt; “He… he dries things out. Drains moisture. Luffy’s… he’s fighting without water…”

Your voice trails.

But **someone hears.**

And the seed is planted.

---

**OOC:**
- Kohza and Vivi are reunited.
- The crowd is *finally* still—awaiting their orders.
- Luffy is **failing** to land damage on Crocodile due to **lack of water.**
- You are maintaining consciousness—barely.
- The true final battle is still brewing.

Would you like to:

1. {Try to offer a theory to the crew—how to hurt Crocodile.}  
2. {Push Kohza and Vivi to take control of the crowd.}  
3. {Keep observing, narratively positioning yourself to reenter in a support role.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - C'mon, blue. Rubber boy's buying you time. Do something.

Look around for Tashigi

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Moment to Lead]**  
**Scene: “Her Kingdom, Her Voice”**  
**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Breath Held Across a Nation**

---

You shift on your side, everything aching, every breath a negotiation between pain and consciousness.

But you’re watching her—**Vivi**—and you can see it.

She’s standing there.

Beside **Kohza**.

Crowd **silent**.

All the pieces are finally aligned.

And she’s **frozen**.

---

So you speak.

Your voice is dry and broken, but it **cuts** through the moment like chalk on a blackboard.

&gt; “C’mon, Blue…”

&gt; “Rubber boy’s buying you time.”

A wheeze.

&gt; “So do something.”

---

She turns to look at you, the world tilting in her eyes.

---

You glance around instinctively—**looking for Tashigi.**

And from your spot on the ground, you **spot her**:

Slumped at the rooftop edge. One hand gripping stone. **Alive.** Bloody. Watching.

She sees you see her.

And gives you the **smallest nod** of confirmation.

She’s out of the fight.

But **she’s here.**

---

Back below, **Vivi breathes in.**

A deep, trembling breath.

She steps forward, slightly past Kohza, who meets her glance—and nods.

---

She raises her hands.

Not in surrender.

But to speak.

---

&gt; “Everyone… **listen to me!**”

Her voice shakes at first, then **steadies**.

&gt; “You’ve all seen it. The fighting. The lies. The people who tried to kill me in my own streets—**dressed as guards!**”

&gt; “You’ve heard the rumors, the drought, the rebellion—**you’ve bled for this country**…”

&gt; “And *so have I!*”

She pulls her cloak aside, revealing the slashes across her arm and shoulder.

---

&gt; “But the truth is this: **the enemy was never each other.**”

&gt; “The enemy is a man who thinks kingdoms are things to break open. Who thinks he can take power from under our palace without ever once earning the right to lead.”

---

She points skyward.

At the swirling **sandstorm**.

At the shape of **Crocodile**, toying with a boy made of rubber and will.

&gt; “The enemy is *up there.*”

---

Silence.

Then:

&gt; “...She’s right,” Kohza says, stepping beside her.

&gt; “The fighting stops. **Now.**”

---

And the crowd… **listens.**

Swords lower.

Banners are dropped.

Someone begins to kneel.

Then more.

---

**The war is ending.**

**Right here.**

Right now.

Because **she said so.**

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has rallied the crowd. The rebellion has officially ceased.  
- Kohza has lent his authority.  
- Crocodile may or may not be aware of the power shift below.  
- Tashigi is alive, still unable to act.  
- You are still conscious—but on the edge.  

Would you like to:
1. {Push yourself to get a message to Luffy—about Crocodile’s weakness.}  
2. {Just rest. You’ve done enough. The next move is theirs.}  
3. {Call out to Tashigi—if she can move, now’s the time.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Lowly remark that even if the war is stopped, there's still the crocodile sized issue in the room to deal with. An issue that's seems to be growing, as Crocodile seems to be growing bored of Luffy 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Calm Before the Sandfall]**  
**Scene: “The Crocodile-Sized Problem”**  
**Tone: Exhausted Realism | Mood: Victory Tainted by What Still Looms**

---

The plaza has stilled.

For the first time since this morning, there is **no shouting**.

No swords clashing. No false flags. No panic.

Only the sound of **wind** whipping across the rooftops.

And the low crackle of **sand building above**.

---

You lie there—juice barely flowing, lungs ragged—and despite the overwhelming relief all around you, **you don’t smile.**

Not yet.

You murmur to no one in particular, maybe Vivi, maybe the ground.

&gt; “Even if the war’s stopped…”

You swallow hard.

&gt; “There’s still the *Crocodile-sized* issue in the room.”

You glance up toward the **rooftop**, where **Luffy is breathing heavy**, clothes torn, sand clinging to his limbs. His **fists are cracked** from the impacts.

**Crocodile?**

**Barely touched.**

---

You watch Luffy **launch another punch**—  
&gt; “Gomu Gomu no Pistol!”

**Crocodile simply parts** into a cloud of sand. Again.

He yawns.

Literally.

---

&gt; “Is that it?” Crocodile says, spinning a tendril of sand around his finger like a bored lecturer with chalk.  
&gt; “Your grand pirate dream riding on this? I expected more from a future corpse.”

He slams a hand into the rooftop, and a **wave of dehydration** spreads across the stone, turning tiles to **dust** beneath Luffy’s feet.

---

Luffy stumbles.

He’s running out of time.

---

Your voice rasps out again.

&gt; “He’s getting bored.”

You cough into your sleeve, something wet and red sticking to your palm.

&gt; “That’s when he gets dangerous.”

---

From her rooftop perch, **Tashigi’s fingers twitch**, her eyes narrowing. She sees it too.

From the plaza, **Vivi looks up**, her joy dimming at the sight.

From beside her, **Kohza’s fists clench.**

---

And around you… the people **watch.**

The rebellion may have ended.

But the **true war** still rages above.

---

**OOC:**
- Crocodile is now entering **second phase**: no longer toying. Luffy is at critical stamina.  
- Crowd is rallying behind Vivi—but helpless against a Warlord.  
- You are too weak to fight—but **not too weak to speak**.

Would you like to:

1. {Speak up: offer the crew the clue to how Luffy can hurt him.}  
2. {Signal Tashigi—pass the torch of action to her, if she can move.}  
3. {Try to conjure a final glob of golden kiwi—wet enough to be... useful?}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Observe with trepidation.

Meanwhile, an angry cloud of smoke of captain rank may or may not be entering the airspace

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Storms Above, Smoldering Below]**  
**Scene: “The Tide Is Still Turning”**  
**Tone: Suspense Building | Mood: Watching the Scales Wobble**

---

You don’t move.

You **can’t**.

But you **watch.**  
Eyes heavy, heart pounding like a kettle drum someone’s spilled a war on.

**Luffy** is staggering now.  
**Crocodile’s** grin is wider. Lazier.

Like a predator deciding whether to eat or just savor the taste of fear a little longer.

The rooftop crumbles beneath the dehydration.  
Stone to sand.  
Foundation to nothing.

&gt; *He’s not just fighting the boy now,* you think.

&gt; *He’s erasing the building from under him.*

---

**Below**, the people stir uneasily. The rebellion’s flame has been doused, but the **weight of helplessness** presses down.

Vivi’s shoulders are rigid again. Her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles glow white.

---

Tashigi, still sprawled across the palace’s lower ledge, tries to push herself up on a trembling elbow—

But stops.

**Even her sword wouldn’t reach him now.**

---

Your gaze flicks to the horizon.

**Something’s changing.**

There—along the eastern edge of the city skyline—  
the faintest, strangest *wisp* of white.

Not a cloud.

Not smoke from the battle.

&gt; *It’s cleaner. Thicker. Angrier.*

It moves **against the wind.**

---

You recognize it.

A **roiling, fuming, cursing** sort of trail.

One that’s punched through buildings and bureaucracy alike.

&gt; *No way…*

---

Somewhere far above, in the rapidly crowding skies—

A voice made of gravel and hatred rasps through gritted teeth.

&gt; “You’re going to pay for laying a hand on my subordinate.”

---

**Smoker has entered Alubarna airspace.**

And he’s not smiling.

---

**OOC:**
- You are observing Crocodile’s dominance.  
- Luffy is near the edge of a tactical defeat—first encounter still mimicking canon.  
- Smoker, finally freed (by Robin? By delay timer?), is now approaching the battlefield.

You are the only one who's noticed the smoke.

Would you like to:

1. {Alert the Straw Hats that a Marine storm might be coming.}  
2. {Continue observing, prepared for the chaos about to erupt.}  
3. {Say something ironic or wise. Like a prophecy. Or a teacher’s final comment before a field trip goes wildly wrong.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Hey... That's an... Interesting looking cloud.

OOC: Per canon, Smoker is likely no match for Crocodile, would like not want to engage directly. But given what he's seen, his injured subordinate, a warlord on the cusp of victory, he chooses to dive in to fight, even if just to by time for something, anything

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Smoke on the Horizon, Storm at the Summit]**  
**Scene: “A Cloud You Don’t Want to Grade Papers With”**  
**Tone: Grave Humor | Mood: A Breath Before Impact**

---

You're still curled up like a **citrus-drenched larva**, too broken to do more than flick juice and twitch your eyebrows.

But you squint toward the sky.

And you see it again.

A thick, rolling **plume of smoke**, parting the desert air like it **doesn’t care about physics**, weather, or your good vacation plans.

---

You rasp out, barely audible to the others around you:

&gt; “Hey…”

&gt; “That’s an… interesting-looking cloud.”

---

**Nami** glances skyward.  
Her brow furrows.

&gt; “That’s not a cloud.”

**Zoro’s grip tightens.**  
**Chopper's ears go stiff.**  
**Vivi turns. Her eyes widen.**

Because now, everyone sees it.

And it’s not a cloud.

It’s a **Marine.**

---

### **Cut to: Above the Palace**

**Luffy hits the rooftop again.**

Coughing. Bleeding. Barely staying upright.

**Crocodile** stands over him, unhurried. Calm. Calculated.

He raises a sand-clawed hand, aiming for Luffy’s chest.

---

&gt; “I’m done playing.”

---

And then—

&gt; *THWOOOSH—!*

A **pillar of white smoke** blasts down from above, crashing between the two fighters like a divine exhale.

**Sand collides with smoke**, billowing outward in a thunderous hiss.

The rooftop shakes.

Tiles explode.

**Crocodile stumbles back. Eyes narrowing.**

&gt; “...You.”

---

Standing in the center of the clash, coat billowing, arms crossed, **is Captain Smoker**.

---

&gt; “Warlord or not, I’ve had it with your games.”

He glances sideways at Luffy—bleeding, swaying, not yet defeated.

&gt; “I don’t like pirates…”

&gt; “But I like tyrants even less.”

---

**Luffy grins.**

Because he knows what this means.

**One more second. One more breath. That’s all he needs.**

---

Crocodile growls.

&gt; “You think smoke can beat sand?”

&gt; “I think pain buys time.”

Smoker slams his fists together. The white cloud **erupts** outward like a curtain of vengeance.

---

And the rooftop **erupts into chaos.**

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker has entered the fight to **buy time**, not win.
- His attack disrupts Crocodile just as he was preparing a finishing blow on Luffy.
- Luffy now has a **crucial window** to regroup.
- The Straw Hats and Vivi are aware of the marine’s arrival.
- You, Sensei, remain the one who first spotted the tide-turning smoke.

Would you like to:

1. {Comment on the situation like a battered war veteran substitute teacher.}  
2. {Try to give tactical advice—how to *actually* hit Crocodile.}  
3. {Just lie there, fully committed to being the most observant human kiwi on the battlefield.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I stare. So... How the hell do we even beat this guy? Do you have any super royal guards in your basement, blue? Now would be a good time

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Tactical Questions From the Ground]**  
**Scene: “An Appropriate Time to Ask for a Miracle”**  
**Tone: Dry | Mood: Tactical Desperation Dressed as Humor**

---

You stare up at the rooftop battleground, **eyes squinting through blood and sand**, watching **smoke and sand clash** like two natural disasters having a very personal disagreement.

&gt; *So that’s Smoker…*

You’re honestly impressed the guy hasn’t been **dissolved yet**, but you’re also **keenly aware** that the only reason Luffy is still breathing is because someone **just got angrier than the Warlord.**

But that can’t last.

So you mutter—loud enough to catch **Vivi’s** attention as she kneels near you, still watching the storm overhead.

---

&gt; “So… how the hell do we even beat this guy?”

Your voice is hoarse, dry, but still lined with sarcasm. That teacher-tone that says *I’ve graded worse situations before, and they all ended in detention.*

&gt; “Do you have any super royal guards in your basement, Blue?”

A wheeze.

&gt; “Now would be a good time…”

---

**Vivi exhales sharply**, somewhere between a laugh and a sob.

&gt; “No super guards. Just me…”

She trails off.

Then straightens a little.

&gt; “But… we *do* have the Poneglyph.”

---

That draws **Nami’s** eyes.

&gt; “What, you think we can *drop it* on him?”

**Usopp** blinks.  
&gt; “Wait, can we?!”

---

**You raise a shaky hand.**

&gt; “Hold up—hold up.”

&gt; “This guy’s made of *sand*. You punch him, he falls apart. You slash him, he *laughs*. He drains people *by touching them*. He’s got sand *inside* the building…”

You point, weakly, at the clashing **Smoker and Luffy**.

&gt; “He’s toying with both a pirate captain and a Marine…”

Then you lock eyes with Vivi.

&gt; “So unless that ancient stone has a juice box hidden in it—”

---

**Zoro, nearby, grunts.**

&gt; “He’s right. We’re not hurting him like this.”

**Nami frowns, then slowly looks toward you.**

&gt; “You said… he dries things out.”

**You nod.**

&gt; “Yeah. Moisture. That’s how he kills.”

**Her eyes widen.**

&gt; “Then the only way to hit him…”

&gt; “Is to be *wetter than he can dry.*”

---

That lands like a thunderclap.

All eyes turn to the rooftop.

To **Luffy**—cracked lips, bruised eyes.

And Crocodile, raising his clawed hand again.

---

They turn back to you.

Specifically, your **fruity-ass self**, laying in a puddle of kiwi juice like a defeated smoothie mascot.

---

**OOC:**
You’ve reignited the central tactical clue: **Crocodile can be hit if he's soaked.**  
Nami has picked up on the idea.  
Vivi and the crew now understand the path to victory—but must act fast.

Would you like to:

1. {Offer your juice. It’s humiliating. But it may just save the brat.}  
2. {Let them figure it out. You’ve done your part. Fade into the background like a noble citrus casualty.}  
3. {Say something ridiculous but inspirational. Something only a high school teacher with head trauma could say.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - I raise an arm weakly. That's... An interesting idea. But given his power level, I think he can dry me out faster than I can juice. Like a really sad battle of attrition, but it looks like a warlord sucking a crumpling juice box dry

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Citrus Analysis at the End of the World]**  
**Scene: “Do Not Suck the Kiwi Box”**  
**Tone: Gallows Humor | Mood: Genius Hidden Behind Deadpan Despair**

---

You raise your arm.

It shakes like a flag in a light breeze.  
It’s sticky.  
It’s green.  
You’re pretty sure a fly has landed on it at least once this hour.

---

&gt; “That’s… an interesting idea.”

Everyone leans in.

Hope flickers across their eyes.

Maybe you have a plan.  
Maybe you’re going to **unleash** something.  
Maybe this is your big hero moment.

You sigh.

&gt; “But given his power level, I think he can dry me out faster than I can juice.”

A beat.

Then, you deadpan:

&gt; “Like a really sad battle of attrition.”

&gt; “But it *looks* like a Warlord sucking a crumpling juice box dry.”

---

**Usopp makes a noise that’s halfway between a laugh and a horrified whimper.**

**Nami** covers her mouth with a hand, eyes wide, not sure if she’s about to giggle or throw up.

**Vivi** just shakes her head in disbelief.

&gt; “You’re unbelievable…”

&gt; “You’re dying. And you’re making jokes about juice boxes.”

---

**Zoro smirks.**

&gt; “He’s got a point.”

&gt; “A really messed up one, but a point.”

---

**Chopper stares at you.**

&gt; “You are… medically… very strange.”

---

But something settles in the group.

That tension cracks just a little.

Not relief. Not peace.

But **focus.**

You may not be the final weapon.

But you **reminded them of what Crocodile really is**.

And that’s enough.

---

High above, **Smoker stumbles**, his smoke dispersing as Crocodile finally gets a solid hit in—  
a slicing **sand spear** that grazes his shoulder and sends him tumbling to the rooftop edge.

**Luffy staggers upright.**

---

It’s almost time.

---

**OOC:**  
- You’ve reminded everyone of Crocodile’s **core weakness**.  
- The Straw Hats are preparing.  
- Luffy is on the cusp of finding his second wind.  
- Smoker’s time is almost up—but he’s bought the crucial opening.

Would you like to:

1. {Try to assist Luffy with one last juice assist—something to get moisture onto Crocodile.}  
2. {Give Vivi or Nami a final tip. Maybe they can use your fruit.}  
3. {Just rest. If this were a test, you've already passed.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Unless we get like, the entire fire brigade of Alabasta to hit him, I doubt we can out-soak him. And judging by the damage to infrastructure I've seen worming my way here, that doesn't seem like an option.

I stare at Vivi (who is feeling dread once more)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Great Desert Dilemma]**  
**Scene: “The Desperate Conclusion”**  
**Tone: Resolute, with a Touch of Reluctant Acceptance**

---

You look at Vivi, and in her eyes you see the same weariness that’s been gnawing at your own. The same dread, like the weight of the entire country pressing down on both of you. It’s not something you can easily shake off.  
The whole desert—this whole kingdom—feels like it’s slipping between your fingers. And you’re not sure you have the strength to hold it back anymore.

---

&gt; “Unless we get like, the entire fire brigade of Alabasta to hit him, I doubt we can out-soak him.”

A humorless laugh bubbles in your chest, though you don’t let it escape. 

&gt; &quot;And judging by the damage to infrastructure I've seen worming my way here, that doesn't seem like an option.”

---

You feel the ache in your bones—of blood loss, of exhaustion—and the realization of how small you really are in the grand scheme of this war.

&gt; **&quot;I wish it was.&quot;**

---

Vivi’s eyes drop, and for a moment, the fight seems to fade out of her. It’s a heavy moment, the kind where you can feel the sky above you, cracked and bleeding, like it might fall any minute.

She opens her mouth to say something, but the words don’t come right away.  

---

**Tashigi stumbles back into the scene, battered and grim, her sword nearly dragging on the ground.**  
She’s not fully healed, but she’s here, and that counts for something.  
The flames of the war still rage in the distance, but it’s not her fight anymore. It’s yours.

She glances between the group, then locks eyes with you. 

&gt; “Do you have a plan...?”

---

But before you can even respond, the tension shifts. It’s the kind of feeling that makes the hairs on your neck stand up. Something’s coming.  
Not just from the battle—there’s something in the air. The ground beneath you is shifting, the energy vibrating, like a storm is about to break.

You can almost feel it: **Crocodile's next move**. The sense of inevitability.

---

&gt; **You turn back to Vivi, your thoughts spiraling.**

---

She looks back at you. **Tired, but with that spark in her eyes still present.**

&gt; “I know what you’re thinking.” She says it with a steadiness that surprises you. **“But this fight isn’t over. It can’t be.”**

---

You look to the plaza, the struggle still going on. You see Luffy struggling against Crocodile's power, Smoker trying to keep him distracted, the world bending under the weight of their conflict.

And you wonder—will the country ever really find peace?

---

**The weight of all that is too much.**

---

But Vivi gives you a silent nod. She trusts you. Maybe even more than you deserve.

---

&gt; **So now, the only question remains:**  
**What’s the next move?**

---

### OOC:  
The group's morale is holding steady, but the clock is ticking.  
- **Crocodile** is growing more dangerous as Luffy continues to tire.  
- **Tashigi** is still in fighting shape, but definitely struggling.  
- **Vivi** is determined to see this through, but the pressure of her responsibilities weighs on her shoulders. 

Do you:  
1. **Try to rally the group for one last push.**  
2. **Concentrate on Crocodile’s weakness**—you know it’s there, if you can just exploit it.  
3. **Give Vivi one last bit of hope**, even if you don’t have the answer.

&gt;&gt; USER: I... I don't suppose you have anything to juice us up, would you, blue?

OOC: The hero water, per canon, gives immense strength to someone at the cost of dying in 5 minutes

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Bargaining with Borrowed Time]**  
**Scene: “The Juice We Really Don’t Want to Drink”**  
**Tone: Grimly Hopeful | Mood: Desperate Solutions, Dangerous Costs**

---

You cough hard enough to rattle your fillings.  
Your voice comes out cracked and half-laughing as you weakly glance at Vivi.

&gt; “I... I don’t suppose you have anything to juice us up, would you, Blue?”

The phrasing is ridiculous, but the question isn’t.

Because you can **feel the walls closing in**.  
Luffy’s blows are **losing power**, even with Smoker’s brief distraction.  
Crocodile’s patience is **gone**.

And your **juice-based combat tactics** are still funny, but they’re not enough to bring down a **warlord made of nightmares.**

---

Vivi’s eyes widen, just a little.  
There’s a flash of something like shame.

&gt; “There is… one thing.”

Her hand trembles as it reaches into the folds of her cloak.

She pulls out a small, round **vial**—no larger than a finger’s width. The liquid inside swirls with a strange silver-blue shimmer. It **glows** faintly.

You recognize it, from a pamphlet you once confiscated from a student who swore it was an energy booster sold in Loguetown.

---

&gt; “*Hero Water.*”

The name alone feels like a slap across the teeth.

She swallows hard.

&gt; “It’s dangerous. It doesn’t heal. It doesn’t fix. It just… forces your body to go beyond its limits.”

&gt; “Anyone who drinks it will gain enough strength to fight at full power again.”

A beat.

&gt; “For five minutes.”

Another pause.

&gt; “Then they die.”

---

The group goes dead silent.

Even the sound of Crocodile’s storm overhead seems to hush for just a moment.

---

You breathe slowly.

&gt; *Oh. Great.*

&gt; *A literal death drink.*

---

**Tashigi** takes a step forward.

&gt; “We can’t ask someone to do that.”

**Zoro** growls.  
&gt; “We’re not asking. We’re figuring out if it’s a last resort.”

**Chopper’s** ears droop.  
&gt; “It’s… poison. Controlled, focused poison.”

---

**Vivi clutches it tighter.**

&gt; “I was saving it. Just in case…”

She doesn’t finish.

But you know what she meant.

---

She was willing to **take it herself** if Crocodile reached the throne room.

---

**OOC:**
You now face a dire choice.  
The **Hero Water** exists. Its power is real—but so is its price.  
Using it could turn the tide... or trade one life for another.

Would you like to:

1. {Insist that no one use it. There has to be another way.}  
2. {Suggest someone specific take it, including yourself.}  
3. {Leave the choice to Vivi—her country, her burden.}  
4. {Try to fake it—simulate the power boost using your fruit to intimidate.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - slowly reach out a shaking arm.

Gimme. Gimme gimme

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Five Minutes to Make a Miracle]**  
**Scene: “One Last Lesson”**  
**Tone: Somber Bravery | Mood: The Quiet Before the Final Bell**

---

There’s no drama in it.

No long speech.

No thundering declaration of heroism.

You just reach out your hand—**trembling**, bruised, fingers curled like a dying leaf—and mutter:

&gt; “Gimme.”

A pause.

Then:

&gt; “Gimme gimme.”

---

The Straw Hats freeze.  
**Tashigi** steps forward instinctively, lips parting in protest.  
**Vivi’s** eyes go wide.

&gt; “You—no, you can’t—!”

You don’t raise your voice.

You don’t look heroic.

You look like a man with a migraine, a moral compass, and **absolutely no better ideas.**

---

&gt; “Blue, if you’ve got another tank, another battalion, or a Navy Admiral in your pocket…”

You shrug—your voice bone-dry:

&gt; “...Now’s the time.”

Silence.

&gt; “Didn’t think so.”

---

**Vivi stares down at the vial.**  
She doesn’t want to hand it over. Every line of her posture screams *don’t make me.*

But then she looks into your eyes.

And she sees it.

Not resolve.

Not fearlessness.

But that **frustrating, responsible adult instinct**.

The one that made you dive between her and assassins.  
The one that refused to run.  
The one that **teaches** by example—even if it kills you.

---

She places the vial in your palm.

Slow.

Like it might shatter the moment she lets go.

&gt; “Eatone-sensei…”

&gt; “Don’t die.”

---

You look at the glass in your hand.

It’s tiny. Barely a shot.

Tastes probably like mouthwash mixed with lightning.

---

You smirk, just a little.

&gt; “Hey…”

&gt; “First time I’ve gotten a drink during school hours.”

---

**OOC: You now possess the Hero Water.**  
Drinking it will give you:  
- Temporary **near-max stamina and physical enhancement**  
- **Heightened Fruit control** (within reason)  
- Ability to **move, fight, and react at full strength for five minutes**  
- **Permanent death** if no medical attention is given after the window closes

You are moments away from making the choice.

Would you like to:

1. {Drink it now. Join the battle above.}  
2. {Wait. Give it to someone else if needed.}  
3. {Offer a final line or joke before you go full juicebox berserker.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - I stare at Vivi, raising an eyebrow. Don't die? I'm pretty sure this guarantees you die.


&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Juice Before Judgment]**  
**Scene: “Dead Man Talking”**  
**Tone: Wry and Grim | Mood: Heartbreaking Humor in Heroism**

---

You stare at the little vial in your palm—barely heavier than a breath, but dense with meaning.

The silver-blue liquid **glints in the desert sun**, swirling like a storm in a bottle.

You look up at **Vivi**, raising an eyebrow like you’re checking a homework excuse.

---

&gt; “Don’t die?” you echo.

You scoff, weakly.

&gt; “I’m *pretty sure* this guarantees you die.”

---

Her breath catches.

You see the corners of her mouth twitch—*not in amusement*, but in raw, painful disbelief. The kind of expression only someone about to lose something precious wears.

&gt; “It’s not funny.”

---

You hold up the vial, squinting at it like you’re grading it.

&gt; “Well, it’s a little funny.”

&gt; “Dying because I drank bad juice? Honestly on-brand for me.”

---

She steps forward like she might yank it back, like she can undo this moment by sheer force of will—

But she stops.

Because she knows.

You *are* going to drink it.

Because you’re not just a teacher.

You’re **her teacher.**

And no one hurts your students on your watch.

---

**Tashigi watches silently**, face tight, fists clenched.  
**The Straw Hats are silent.**  
No jokes from Usopp.  
No quips from Sanji.  
Even Zoro’s jaw is set.

---

Because they know.

This isn't some clever stunt.

This is the part of the lesson that only the **grown-up in the room** can teach.

---

The bell is about to ring.

And you’re **not going to let class end early.**

---

**OOC:**

This is your final moment of choice before drinking the Hero Water.

Would you like to:

1. {Chug it now—launch into the sky and give Crocodile hell.}  
2. {Say one last line to the kids—Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats.}  
3. {Wait—buy just a few more seconds before the final bell.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - observe the others. Slow get to my knees

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Teacher Stands]**  
**Scene: “Eyes on Me”**  
**Tone: Weighted | Mood: The Silence Before Sacrifice**

---

The vial rests in your hand, **cold as dread**.  
The silence around you isn't just tension—it's respect.  
Unspoken, grim, heavy respect.

You’ve seen it before in the classroom, after a hard truth sinks in.  
This isn’t a lecture.  
This is a **lesson no one wants to witness.**

---

You shift.

Your knees scream, but you push through the pain.  
Your **handplants** into the cobblestone.  
One foot slips.  
Then braces.

**You rise.**

Not all the way—but **to your knees**, your spine curving like a man resisting gravity itself.

A man deciding—*no, not yet*.

---

The others watch.

**Vivi’s eyes shimmer**, lips parted, the weight of a kingdom behind them.  
She doesn’t speak. She can’t.  
This is your stage now.

**Tashigi’s gaze narrows**, fists clenched so tight her bandages stain red.  
She’s fought beside you, bled beside you.

**Chopper stares** with a healer’s horror.

**Nami’s arms are crossed**, but her face betrays the lump in her throat.

**Sanji lights a cigarette.** Doesn’t smoke it.  
Just lights it. For the silence.

**Zoro bows his head.** Quiet. No mocking words.

**Usopp doesn’t move.** Doesn’t blink.

---

Even **Luffy**, far above, turns his battered face toward the plaza—  
As if something inside him **feels it**.

Feels you.

---

The man who slid into battle on juice, cracked jokes between near-death, and **called himself a teacher** with no army, no crew, no Devil Fruit to break the sky—

Just **kiwi juice and spite.**

---

You look at each of them.

Each of your kids.

Your students.

And you **see it.**

That they’re waiting for you to say something.

One last line.

One last *thing they'll remember.*

---

**OOC:**  
Your knees are shaking. The vial is still in your hand.  
You have this **one moment** before fate pushes you forward.

Would you like to:

1. {Deliver a final line—directed to them all.}  
2. {Address someone specific (Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats).}  
3. {Say nothing. Let the act speak for itself.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - well, I sure hope that it doesn't taste too bad. I conjure a tiny kiwi elemental at my feet, just making sure that my power still works before I down the drink. Would be a waste of it only powered me up when I could only throw punches.

I keep the tiny elemental up. I stare at the drink, building resolve. 

OOC: Any objections? (There may be none)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – One Sip From Immortality, or Death]**  
**Scene: “The Last Pretest Check”**  
**Tone: Weighted Anticipation | Mood: Hearts Held at the Edge**

---

You hold the vial steady, fingers curled tight.  
Its glow flickers against your skin—**hero water**, the kind of name a child would trust, and a soldier would die for.

But before you commit, you flick your wrist.

A small **ripple of green** slithers around your heel—  
**a tiny kiwi elemental**, barely the size of a cat, burbling out of the cobblestones with a wobbling grunt.

It blinks at you.

Wobbles.

Then **flexes a stubby arm**.

---

You smirk. It works.  
Your power’s still there.  
Not much—but enough to show that **the engine isn’t dead**.

You give the little blob a nod.

&gt; “Good. I’d hate to go out just throwing punches.”

---

You stare down at the vial again, the glow now **reflected in the eyes of everyone around you**.

No one’s speaking.

Not a single one.

---

**Chopper’s hooves twitch**, but he bites his tongue.  
**Tashigi looks ready to stop you**, but her knees don’t move.  
**Vivi’s holding her breath** like it’s the only thing keeping her from screaming.

Even **Luffy**, overhead, watches the glow from the edge of the rooftop, battered and barely standing.

---

They understand now.

This isn’t a dramatic stand.

It’s a **teacher making damn sure his class gets home safe.**

---

**OOC: There are no objections.**

None dare speak.

None dare stop you.

Because they all know—

**You’ve already chosen.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Drink the Hero Water now. No more words.}  
2. {Say one last line—to them, to yourself, to fate.}  
3. {Hand the vial to someone else, if you’ve changed your mind.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Hmm. All or nothing. I raise the vial to my lips...

Only for my arms to cramp at the last second, and the vial falls from my hand.

Oh shit!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Fall of the Hero’s Drink]**  
**Scene: “Catch It or Die Trying”**  
**Tone: Absolute Panic | Mood: Fate Rolling on the Sand**

---

The plaza holds its breath.

You raise the vial, glinting bright in the fading sun—  
Your expression serious, resolved.  
A man about to down destiny like a bitter shot of vengeance.

Your fingers curl.  
The vial tilts.  
Liquid shimmers—

---

&gt; *TWITCH.*

Your forearm **seizes**—a last cruel joke from your overused, over-torn, barely-living body.

Your hand jerks.

The vial slips.

&gt; *tink*

&gt; *tink*

&gt; **“OH SHIT—!”**

---

Time slows.

---

The **Hero Water** begins its descent.  
A slow-motion arc of shimmering doom.

The whole plaza watches—**horrified**—as the last hope for a miracle **plummets** toward the dusty stone.

---

**Chopper screams.**  
**Tashigi gasps.**  
**Zoro lunges a half-step—too far.**  
**Nami clutches her head.**  
**Usopp points in sheer disbelief.**

**Vivi’s mouth opens but makes no sound.**

---

The tiny **kiwi elemental at your feet** stares at the falling vial.

And does **the one thing it knows.**

---

**It jumps.**

---

With a *splork* and a *splat*, the little blob **launches** its gelatinous self up and out—**body stretching mid-air like a citrus trampoline**—

And **catches the vial in its gooey center**.

It lands with a thud.

Rolls once.

And sits.

Proud.

Glowing faintly.

Still clutching the vial in its wobbling torso.

---

The silence is **staggering**.

Then—

&gt; “WELL OKAY THEN,” you cough, absolutely losing your composure as your heart slams against your ribs like a battering ram.

You stare at the blob.

It wobbles back.

&gt; “...Good job, Juicebox Jr.”

---

You reach forward with your still-trembling hand, **gratefully retrieving** the vial from your **blobby savior.**

You glance back at the crew—every one of them **frozen in suspended disbelief.**

&gt; “I was... just testing your reaction time.”

&gt; “Totally on purpose.”

---

**OOC:**  
- Hero Water was nearly lost.  
- Caught miraculously by your **kiwi elemental**, which now seems... a little smug.  
- The moment shattered tension—but **refocused the group.**
- This is your final moment before the real transformation.

Would you like to finally:

1. {Drink it. No more fumbles. Let the battle begin.}  
2. {Name the blob. It deserves that much.}  
3. {Do both. With style.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - it caught the vial before it shattered... But not before it cracked.

I reach down to the elemental to pick up the vial, only to notice the water rapidly draining out of the bottom into the puddle around the elemental.

Vivi and Tashigi notices too.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Hope That Leaks]**  
**Scene: “A Crack in the Miracle”**  
**Tone: Crushing Realization | Mood: From Glory to Horror**

---

You reach down toward the blob—your loyal little citrus spawn—  
still wobbling proudly with the vial cradled in its gelatinous middle.

The plaza, moments ago a statue garden of **shock and awe**, breathes in again as your hand reaches the vial.

---

But then—

You see it.

So does Vivi.

So does Tashigi.

---

A thin, **silver stream**.

The Hero Water.

**Dripping.**

Not from your fingers.

**From the vial.**

---

A **hairline crack**, nearly invisible, spiderwebs across the glass like a cruel afterthought.  
The impact hadn’t shattered it—

It had **wounded it**.

---

And in that moment of tension, in that **delay**,  
the one thing you all feared more than death begins to happen:

&gt; *Drip.*  
&gt; *Drip.*  
&gt; *Drip.*

The precious liquid is bleeding out into the puddle of **kiwi juice** beneath the elemental.  
Diluting.  
Spreading.  
**Soaking into the sand.**

---

You freeze.

The blob stares up at you.

It doesn’t understand what it’s done.

But **Vivi does.**

Her hands fly to her mouth, her voice breaking.

&gt; “No—no, no, no—”

---

**Tashigi** stumbles forward, eyes wide with alarm, as if sheer willpower might reverse physics.

&gt; “Stop it—get it off the ground! It’s—it’s leaking!”

---

You scoop the vial—

Too late.

**Half empty.**

Maybe **less.**

The glow is **fading**.

The **miracle is seeping away.**

---

The crowd doesn’t know yet.

But the Straw Hats do.

And the look in their eyes is a mixture of **tragedy and furious disbelief**.

---

**OOC:**

You have seconds.  
The Hero Water is nearly gone.

You could:

1. {Drink the remaining contents immediately. It may still work—at reduced potency, and possibly harsher side effects.}  
2. {Try to slurp it up from the puddle—wild, disgusting, but maybe effective.}  
3. {Let it go. It’s over. Try to warn Luffy with your final breath.}  
4. {Do something else. Something unhinged, impulsive, or unexpected.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - the remaining droplets drain from the vial when I raise it to my lips again. Oh. Oh no. Oh no no no.

OOC: observe the others reactions.

I kneel down desperately to the puddle of kiwi and heroism, about to drink off the sandy cobblestone, when suddenly... 

(Pause)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Lowest Point Before the Rise]**  
**Scene: “The Taste of Dust and Desperation”**  
**Tone: Gutting | Mood: All or Nothing, and Mostly Nothing**

---

You lift the vial to your lips again, clenching your jaw, ready to die gloriously and violently for the kids, the country, and the curriculum—

But when you tilt it back...

&gt; *drip...*  
&gt; *...nothing.*

Just a whisper of air.

The **last drops** escape past your lips.

---

&gt; “Oh.”

A pause.

&gt; “Oh no.”

You shake it.

No glow.

No miracle.

Only a drop of shame and a faint citrus aftertaste.

---

You stare at the empty glass like it’s just flunked your best student.

---

&gt; “Oh no no no…”

You drop to your knees, ignoring every scream from your wounds, every insult from your spine, and every ounce of remaining dignity.

You stare down at the **puddle**.

A shallow mixture of **Hero Water and kiwi juice**, soaking into **gritty cobblestone** and flecked with **desert dust**.

Your last chance.  
Diluted.  
Polluted.  
Ruined.

And you do what **no one** expected:

You **lean in**.

Like a man about to suck hope off the bathroom floor.

---

**The Straw Hats’ faces:**

- **Usopp:** “...He’s not really gonna—”
- **Nami:** “Oh my GOD he is.”
- **Chopper:** “NO, WAIT, THAT’S UNSANITARY!!”
- **Zoro:** (half a blink, slow shake of the head)
- **Sanji:** “Respect. But, goddamn.”

---

**Tashigi stares. Speechless.**

**Vivi steps forward, hand half-raised.**

&gt; “Wait—Eatone—*don’t—*”

---

**Then—suddenly—**

The air shifts.

Not a gust. Not Crocodile.

Something else.

A **light splash** beneath your fingers.

You freeze.

Look down.

And see the **tiny kiwi elemental**, wobbling quietly—

Its gooey little body **swollen**, rippling with a faint silver-blue shimmer.

Its stubby arms raised.

Eyes—if you can call them that—locked on you.

---

The blob **absorbed the mix.**

**All of it.**

---

And now it’s **glowing.**

---

**OOC:**

The diluted Hero Water didn’t vanish—it was **absorbed by your elemental.**  
Its glow now pulses **faintly but rhythmically**, rippling inside the semi-liquid body like a bottled storm.

It’s not dead.  
It’s not human.  
But it’s **something.**

Would you like to:

1. {Command the elemental—use it. All in.}  
2. {Fuse with it. Attempt to let it act as your new power source.}  
3. {Let it decide what to do. It’s a part of you, after all.}  
4. {Something unexpected. Something wild.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - ​Uhhh...?

I'm suddenly knocked off my feet, as the little elemental I was kneeling over explodes like a verdant pillar, reaching to the sky. It grows, the it's cascading base growing in width, knocking me off my knees, and I crash into Vivi and Tashigi behind me.

OOC: The elemental is separate from me, for now

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Birth of the Emerald Storm]**  
**Scene: “Juiced Awakening”**  
**Tone: Awe-Struck Mayhem | Mood: Tropical Divinity Descends**

---

&gt; “Uhhh…?”

It’s the last thing you manage to mumble before the world turns green.

---

The **tiny elemental**, once barely knee-height and endearingly lumpy, suddenly **tenses**. Its round shape **quivers**—like someone just lit a fuse inside a fruit-shaped water balloon.

---

And then—

&gt; **BOOM.**

A *verdant column* **erupts skyward**, exploding upward from the puddle like a geyser of tropical power.  
It **blasts through the air** with a sound like a *thunderclap wrapped in splashback*.

---

You’re knocked **clean off your feet**, juice-soaked and stupefied.

&gt; “GAH—!”

You sail back like a tossed sack of overripe groceries, colliding full-force into **Vivi** and **Tashigi**, sending all three of you into a **very undignified, citrusy dogpile**.

---

&gt; *THUD.*  
&gt; *“Oof!”*  
&gt; *“Mmphf—!”*

---

The crowd gasps.

And in front of them—

**Something monstrous takes shape.**

---

The **pillar of emerald** collapses inward, compresses, then reshapes—  
forming massive **arms**, a **torso**, and a churning, bubbling **core** that glows silver-blue like an unstable star.

A new **kiwi elemental** rises.

But not tiny.

This one is **twenty feet tall**, shoulders wide as a ship, with swirling liquid veins pulsing like fire through gelatin.

Its eyes glow.

And then it roars.

&gt; **RRRRAUUUUUGHHHH!!**

Juice sprays from its open maw like vaporized sugar.

---

**The Hero Water didn’t empower *you*.**

It **evolved your fruit.**

And gave life to something **outside you.**

**Independent. Powerful. Unstable.**

---

**Crocodile’s sandstorm halts.**  
The crowd turns.  
Even **Luffy**, mid-fight, stares down at the plaza below.

&gt; “...What the hell is that?”

---

**Zoro mutters:**

&gt; “Is that... pineapple guy’s Stand?”

**Usopp:**

&gt; “It’s *alive?!*”

**Sanji:**

&gt; “...That thing looks like it could take on the Sea Kings.”

---

**OOC:**
- The kiwi elemental has *absorbed* the diluted Hero Water.
- It now stands as a semi-autonomous **powerhouse**, glowing with fruit-based rage and unknown limits.
- It’s not directly under your control—but it *knows* you. And it *knows your will*.
- Crocodile has taken notice.
- Vivi and Tashigi are stunned (and slightly squished beneath you).

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt to command the elemental. It might respond.}  
2. {Try to stand. Rally. Lead. It might listen to leadership.}  
3. {Say something really dumb as you lay in the arms of two women beneath a juice god.}

The **kiwi elemental towers** above the plaza now—arms flexed, back arched, chest heaving with mist and purpose. The Hero Water surges visibly in its chest cavity like a **molten tropical reactor**, its core a churning mix of **silver-blue light and viridescent juice**.

Every living being in Alubarna has stopped what they’re doing. The war. The arguments. The cheering. The crying.

They are all, to a person, just **staring** at this **glowing, fruit-flavored titan.**

**You, meanwhile, are lying tangled in a half-crushed pile of royalty and justice**, your limbs draped over **Tashigi’s lap**, your back against **Vivi’s hip**, blinking upward at the skyscraper of kiwi pulp now howling your emotional state into the heavens.

You murmur:

&gt; “I… I didn’t know fruit could roar.”

---

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; “W-what did you *do?*”

**Vivi:**  
&gt; “What is it *doing??*”

---

Above, the elemental takes a step forward—  
**cobblestones shatter** beneath its translucent feet, juice splashing in all directions like a living tsunami.

Its fists clench.

Its body twists toward the palace.

Its **eyes lock on Crocodile.**

---

And from atop the roof—

**Crocodile frowns.**

For the first time.

---

He watches this emerald juggernaut take its first proper steps into **his battlefield**.

He mutters:

&gt; “...What kind of Devil Fruit *is that?*”

---

And beside him, **Luffy grins.**

A tired, bloodied grin.

&gt; “That’s our juice guy.”

---

**OOC:**
- You have summoned a one-time **Fruit Awakening manifestation**, supercharged by Hero Water.
- The elemental is **autonomous**, powerful, and acting in defense of you and Vivi.
- Crocodile is officially concerned.
- You, meanwhile, are still horizontal, injured, and incredibly confused.

Would you like to:
1. {Attempt to psychically influence the elemental through shared will.}  
2. {Let it go—see what it does next.}  
3. {Try to stand. Say something leader-like. Probably fall over again.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Go! Get that mothafucka!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Juice Awakens]**  
**Scene: “One Command, No Filter”**  
**Tone: Furious | Mood: Visceral Catharsis With Pulp**  

---

Your head's pounding.  
Your ribs are basically a jigsaw puzzle.  
You're sprawled across two confused women.  
And there's a **25-foot glowing juice elemental** standing on the battlefield like it owns the mineral rights.

---

So you do the only thing that makes sense.

You dig your **bloody fingers into the stone**, push yourself halfway upright, and with the voice of a man who just watched a kingdom burn, scream:

&gt; “**GO!! GET THAT MOTHAFUCKA!!!**”

---

Your voice echoes across the plaza like a war horn made of citrus rage.

The elemental reacts **instantly**.

Its massive form twitches once—then shudders—then **lets loose a second roar**, this one loud enough to rattle windows and send a dozen seagulls flapping madly from the city walls.

It turns.

It **points a single dripping, glowing finger** at **Crocodile**.

Then it **launches forward**, each step a crater, each movement liquid thunder.

---

**Crocodile’s eyes widen.**  
He barely has time to react.

&gt; *CRASH!*

A colossal **fist of gelatinous might** slams down on the rooftop, **obliterating part of the palace corner**—  
**Crocodile leaps back**, sand swirling protectively, but he’s **on the defensive** for the first time.

---

**Luffy, seeing the opening, lunges.**

&gt; “Gomu Gomu no—”

&gt; **“GATLING!!!”**

A barrage of fists rain in behind the elemental's assault.

Sand clashes with juice.

**Steel clashes with pulp.**

Hero Water **sizzles** through Crocodile’s defenses.

The rooftop becomes a **maelstrom of fruit, fists, and fury.**

---

Below, the crowd **explodes** with cheers and terrified awe.

---

**Usopp:** “I knew he was hiding something! He had *kaiju energy*!”

**Zoro:** “That thing’s stronger than *me.* I hate that it’s stronger than me.”

**Nami:** “If it wins, I’m naming it ‘Smoothie.’”

---

Vivi and Tashigi both stare in awe as the elemental **plows through Crocodile’s outer sand barrier**, **driving him back across the roof.**

You?

You just slump down again, exhausted.

But grinning.

---

&gt; “Good boy…”

&gt; “Teach him what pulp can do.”

---

**OOC:**
- Your command was heard. Loud and clear.
- The Kiwi Elemental is now engaged in **full-scale battle** with Crocodile, giving Luffy an opening to land real hits.
- The tide of battle is turning.
- You have fulfilled your role—for now.

Would you like to:
1. {Keep watching. Offer commentary. Maybe cry. Just a little.}  
2. {Pass out, dramatically. You’ve earned the nap.}  
3. {Attempt one final fruit-powered support act, even from the ground.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Force myself to stay awake. The elemental might disperse if I pass out. I sure am having trouble though, that concussion from the armored headbutt is rearing its ugly head again.

Vivi and/or Tashigi may notice

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Holding the Thread]**  
**Scene: “Juice and Willpower”**  
**Tone: Desperate | Mood: Quiet Tension Beneath Roaring Chaos**  

---

You’re shaking.

Vision’s blurring.  
Ears ringing.  
The roar of the battle above is like thunder filtered through a waterlogged megaphone.

But you stay conscious.

**You *have* to.**

Because that **thing up there**—that roaring, silver-veined Kiwi Titan—**it’s still you.**  
Still connected.

Still running on the last dregs of **your willpower**.

And if you **go out**, it might too.

---

&gt; “Not yet… can’t... sleep now…”

You press your palms into the warm, juice-slick cobblestone, trying to ground yourself—literally and figuratively. The sand grits into your scraped skin.

A slow, **metallic throbbing** pulses at the back of your skull.

The **concussion** is back in full force.  

Every heartbeat feels like a drum being played by a vengeful taiko demon.

---

Above, you hear the elemental roar again—**fist connecting with sand**, its weight shaking the palace rooftop. Luffy’s voice cuts through, hoarse and furious.

&gt; “Take this, bastard!!”

---

But your eyelids are slipping.

The corners of your vision begin to close in, **tunneling into shadows**.

&gt; *No. Not yet. Not yet.*

---

You feel a touch.

Two, actually.

**Vivi’s hand on your chest.**

**Tashigi’s at your wrist.**

---

Vivi’s voice is soft but full of rising panic.

&gt; “He’s crashing. He’s crashing—Tashigi, what do we do?!”

**Tashigi’s hand clenches.** Her jaw is tight.

&gt; “He’s still connected to that thing... if he passes out, we might lose our only edge.”

She leans close—sweat-streaked, bloodied, but focused.

&gt; “Eatone. *Sensei.* Stay with us.”

&gt; “You started this lesson. You *finish* it.”

---

You blink.  
Barely.

You try to respond. Your mouth forms syllables that might be words, might be fruit-related nonsense.

---

Vivi moves closer, placing both hands on your cheeks, eyes wide and glistening.

&gt; “You're not allowed to die like this. Not until we’ve won.”

---

Above, a **sand spear slices through the elemental’s arm**. It reforms—slower this time. Your breathing falters.

The connection is growing thin.

---

**OOC:**

You’re holding on—barely.  
Your consciousness is the **thread** keeping the Kiwi Elemental fighting.

Would you like to:

1. {Say something to keep yourself anchored—to Vivi, Tashigi, or the crew.}  
2. {Push through with a desperate fruit technique—transfer control? Boost the elemental?}  
3. {Try to rally the elemental with emotion—through memory, conviction, or will.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - Murmur in a very distinctly near-unconscious way. Something about having to do my taxes

**Scene: “The Things We Die Thinking About”**  
**Tone: Tragicomedy | Mood: Barely Clinging to the World**  

---

Your body’s a **wreck**.  
Your skull feels like it’s been used to cork a cannon.  
The world around you blurs into bright streaks of battle and the warm smother of concerned hands.

---

You try to say something meaningful.  
Heroic. Impactful. Maybe something Luffy would yell from a rooftop.

But your **mouth**—your **teacher’s soul**—has other plans.

---

&gt; “...didn’t even finish…”

Your lips move against Vivi’s trembling hands.  
Your voice is barely a whisper, like sand pouring through torn parchment.

&gt; “...the form for the… income declaration…”

A wheeze.

&gt; “...owe the Treasury like… thirty thousand beri…”

A faint choke. You try to swallow, but you mostly taste dust and kiwi.

&gt; “...I think I counted the bounty money *twice*…”

---

**Vivi stares.**

**Tashigi blinks.**

**Zoro slowly turns his head.**

&gt; “Did he just say—”

**Sanji:** “Yeah.”

**Usopp:** “He’s dying… and he’s thinking about his *taxes.*”

---

**Nami:**

She clutches her head.

&gt; “That’s it. He’s officially one of us.”

---

Above, the **elemental’s core flickers**—but pulses stronger.  
Almost like it heard the muttered bureaucratic regret of its creator…

And it **roars. Again. Louder.**  
Kiwi energy flares. **Crocodile reels**.

---

Tashigi leans in again, voice low, biting back a laugh and a sob.

&gt; “You’re not allowed to die while owing back taxes, Sensei.”

&gt; “You’re *staying awake*, and *you’re paying those goddamn fees*—got it?”

---

Your eyelids flutter.

You grunt softly. Somewhere between a whimper and a citrus-flavored curse.

---

**OOC:**

You’re right on the edge, teacher.

Your brain is clearly **running on fumes**, but your **connection to the elemental strengthens briefly**—as if even your subconscious refuses to let this be your last thought.

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt to speak again. Force yourself back with another thought, ridiculous or real.}  
2. {Let your body stay still, but mentally guide the elemental one last time.}  
3. {Give the floor to the elemental—it may now act on instinct. Its instinct is... yours.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - my consciousness starts fading away.

The elemental slows down a touch. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Rooftop &amp; Plaza – The Thread Frays]**  
**Scene: “Sleep of the Teacher”**  
**Tone: Quiet Dread | Mood: Fragile, Fading Connection**  

---

Your eyes flutter.

The pressure behind them is a thundering drumbeat now.  
Your chest rises once. Slowly.  
Then again—shallower.  

Your blood feels **thin**, and your breath tastes like citrus and dust.

You feel like you’re **sinking into your own body**.

The world spins.

---

Your thoughts fracture—fleeting shards of memory and sensation.

- **A school bell ringing.**  
- **Juice boxes being passed around.**  
- **A student asking if Devil Fruits count as “vegetables.”**  
- **You, correcting the spelling of ‘homicide’ on a bounty form.**  
- **A voice saying: “Don’t die, Sensei.”**

---

**The lights begin to dim.**

---

Up on the palace roof, the **Kiwi Elemental’s** pace begins to **slow.**

Its movements—once thunderous, now **lagging**, deliberate.  
Its glowing veins pulse—sluggish.  
One fist misses its mark by inches.  
**Crocodile slips free**, a malicious grin returning to his face.

&gt; “I knew it wasn’t yours to wield.”

---

**Luffy stares.**

**Eyes wide. Jaw clenched.**

&gt; “No… come on… don’t give out on us now…”

---

Back below—

**Tashigi sees it.**

**Vivi feels it.**

The link is fraying.

---

You—barely aware—feel something shift.

Like a **classroom being abandoned before the last question is answered**.  
Like the **lesson ending** before the test is done.

---

You don’t want to go.

But your body is shutting down.

---

**OOC:**

Your next breath might be your last unless something intervenes.  
The elemental is fading in tandem.

Would you like to:

1. {Let go. Drift into unconsciousness. Trust in the others.}  
2. {Call out mentally—desperately—to the elemental. One last command.}  
3. {Reach for someone—Vivi, Tashigi, anyone. Try to tether yourself with their presence.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - Something about Snack Pack, the Bananagator. Also the two blurry figures in my vision.

OOC: the elemental, while big, is relatively slow, and hasn't been able to land anything other than glancing hits, so crocodile is only lightly moistened. However, Luffy is fully coated with liquid. Smoker is injured.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Fading Light and the Fractured Mind]**  
**Scene: “Juice, Dreams, and the Edges of Reality”**  
**Tone: Desperate | Mood: Surreal, Slipping Sanity**  

---

Your fingers twitch on the stone.

The world has gone **soft around the edges**, like wet chalk left out in the rain. Sounds are **muted**, warped—your heartbeat is a distant drum. Your skin is buzzing, but your limbs feel like they’re filled with pudding and regret.

You blink once.

Twice.

**Vision swims.**

Everything in front of you is a wash of **bright sand and green vapor**, and in the middle of it—

&gt; **Two blurry silhouettes.**

One is **small, hunched**, protective. The other **tall, sturdy**, maybe holding something.

And somewhere in the blur—

You see it.

**Snack Pack.**

A Bananagator.

Majestic. Beautiful. Emotionally unstable and weirdly fast for its size.

---

You exhale.

A wheeze, more breath than voice.

&gt; “...Snack Pack…”

Your cracked lips try to form more.

&gt; “He... he never got his final race…”

Your voice breaks. You don’t even know who you’re talking to.

&gt; “He had so much more... to give…”

---

You reach forward, blindly, your hand **fumbling in the air**.

Vivi sees it first—her instincts kick in.

She reaches down, **grabs your hand**, clutches it tight.

&gt; “I’ve got you. You’re not going anywhere.”

Tashigi presses her palm to your forehead, trying to stabilize you, even as your skin grows cold.

---

&gt; “Don’t let him die here,” she whispers.  
&gt; “*Don’t let this be his last class.*”

---

Above, the **elemental lurches.**

It slows—

Then stops—

Then trembles—

---

And its **head turns**.

Toward you.

Toward your flickering life.

Its creator.

---

The glow in its chest **brightens**.

Its movements **change**.

No longer sluggish, lumbering. No longer trying to bludgeon Crocodile into submission—

Instead, it **flickers**—**pressurizes**—

**Concentrates.**

---

It looks at **Luffy**, slick with juice.  
It looks at **Crocodile**, smug, confident, *barely wet enough to be annoying.*

And the elemental **roars again**—

But this time it’s not a war cry.

It’s a **warning.**

---

OOC:  
- Your unconscious plea and Vivi’s presence have **tethered you to consciousness**—for now.  
- The elemental has recognized your weakness, and is about to make a **choice.**  
- Luffy is primed. Crocodile is still slippery—but vulnerable, if timed right.  
- **Snack Pack’s memory has been honored.**

Would you like the elemental to:

1. {Transfer its remaining moisture and Hero Water into Luffy—all in, one chance.}  
2. {Perform a final attack—pin or bind Crocodile to give Luffy a guaranteed hit.}  
3. {Disperse in an explosion of pressurized juice, soaking the field—maximizing Luffy’s impact.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - snack pack isn't enough. Continue losing more and more consciousness

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Final Descent]**  
**Scene: “A Teacher’s Fade”**  
**Tone: Slow Collapse | Mood: Beautiful, Crushing Silence**

---

You feel their hands—**Vivi’s grip** tightening around yours, **Tashigi’s trembling fingers** brushing across your temple—but their voices are growing **distant**.

Not just quiet.

**Far.**

As though they’re speaking from across a canyon filled with fog.

---

Your mind drifts.

Not with grandeur. Not with slow-motion flashbacks or heroic last thoughts.

But with the ridiculous, the mundane.

- The sound of chalk on a board.  
- A classroom door squeaking.  
- The weird lumpy feeling of sitting on a half-squashed fruit during lunch duty.  
- **Snack Pack.**

---

&gt; “...I really liked that gator…”

Your voice is barely audible.

&gt; “...he was fast... I bet he cheated though…”

&gt; “...they always cheat in those races…”

---

Your head slips against Tashigi’s arm.

The plaza’s war is just **background static now.**

---

Your final thread of lucidity begins to unspool.

You don’t even feel afraid.

Just **cold.**

So tired.

---

Up on the rooftop—

**The Kiwi Elemental pauses.**

Its glowing eyes dim.

It lowers its arms.

Not in defeat.

But in **grief.**

---

You were its creator.

Its parent.

And it **felt you slipping.**

---

And then...

The glow inside it **shifts.**

Flickers.

Brightens again.

Brighter than before.

Not just juice.

Not just Hero Water.

But...

**Purpose.**

---

Because maybe this isn’t about fighting anymore.

Maybe it’s about **delivering a legacy.**

---

**OOC:**  
Your character has reached the brink of unconsciousness.  
You are no longer able to issue commands.  
Your elemental—powered by Hero Water, instinct, and your emotional tether—will now act on its own.

Next scene:  
**“Final Lesson: Impact”**

Would you like to:

1. {Watch it unfold through the haze. Fragmented, dreamlike.}  
2. {Fully pass out. Let the narrative move without your awareness, until someone brings you back.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Scene shift: Tashigi and Vivi's POV. Do they try anything?

The Kiwi Elemental slows to a crawl, standing aimlessly. Crocodile is pleased by this turn of events. Luffy's punches are still occasionally landing, though

**Tone: Desperate Stillness | Mood: Too Quiet, Too Soon**  

---

**Tashigi’s arms are locked around him now—**  
her knees dug into the juice-slick stone,  
trying to steady **his sagging frame**.

Her voice shakes as she speaks, even as she tries to mask it with Marine precision.

&gt; “He’s not... He’s not responding anymore.”

The words cut through **Vivi** like a knife.  
She leans over, one hand on his shoulder, the other braced on her own trembling knee.

&gt; “He’s... still breathing. Right?”

**Tashigi doesn’t answer.**

Because she’s not sure.

---

Up above, the **Kiwi Elemental**—once a gleaming symbol of citrus divinity—now stands motionless.

Its gelatinous arms hang low, twitching faintly, like a puppet whose strings have been abandoned mid-pull.

**Its glow dims.**

Not with death—

But with **disconnect.**

---

Crocodile sees it.

He **straightens**, satisfied. The slow grin returns.

&gt; “So the juice finally ran dry.”

He slashes his hand outward—**a slicing sand arc** rips through the air.

The Elemental takes the hit—

&gt; *SHHHHRRKKK*

—and does **nothing**.

No counter. No roar.  
Just **a heavy, wet lurch**, as though gravity is finally catching up.

---

Luffy charges in again, breathing like a wild animal.  
His body is still soaked. His fists still glowing.  
He lands a blow—  
&gt; *BAM!*

**Crocodile stumbles back.**

But only slightly.

---

The momentum is breaking.

---

**Back below—Tashigi's voice sharpens.**

&gt; “We need to wake him up.”

Her hand slaps Eatone’s face gently—then harder.

&gt; “Eatone. Sensei. Wake the hell up!”

Nothing.

---

**Vivi’s eyes dart between the battle above and the man below.**

The teacher who stopped the assassin.  
Who protected her in Rainbase.  
Who called her *Blue* and always stood between her and the blast zone.

And now?

He’s slipping away.

---

She looks up again.

At the **towering Elemental**, twitching like a dying lighthouse.

At the **battle barely being held** by a boy with rubber bones and pure grit.

&gt; “We have to do *something!*”

---

**OOC:**  
Both Tashigi and Vivi are desperate, exhausted, and unsure how to reengage the Elemental—or rouse you.

The Elemental is now **functionally unresponsive.** The link is fading.

Would you like them to:

1. {Try a last-ditch emotional plea—words to Eatone, not the Elemental.}  
2. {Attempt to create a physical reaction—move his body, apply pressure, or stimulate senses.}  
3. {Try something unorthodox—combine Vivi’s knowledge and Tashigi’s discipline in a risky plan.}  
4. {Leave it up to them, and see what happens.}

**Tashigi** kneels lower, her brow beaded with sweat, hand cupping the back of your head. Her voice is **tight, authoritative**, trained, but **strained by fear.**

&gt; “Eatone! That Elemental's *your* fruit! Your power! You have to stay awake or it’s going to fall—and Luffy with it!”

She slaps your cheek again—harder.  
&gt; “We’re not done yet, dammit! Don’t you *dare* leave a job half-done!”

---

**Vivi**, chest heaving with panic, kneels beside her.  
Her hands tremble, but she grabs your hand again.  
She holds it between hers like it’s the last tether to her sanity.

&gt; “Please. Sensei…”

&gt; “You can’t go out like this.”

&gt; “We need you.”

She leans in closer. Her voice softens—but cracks:

&gt; “*I* need you.”

---

Still nothing.

But then—

Vivi looks at the **draining color** of the elemental.  
She glances at the sticky **kiwi trail around the stone**.

She remembers.

---

&gt; “Your fruit responds to will. To protection.”

She pulls a flask from her side—**water.** A tiny bit.  
Just enough.

She splashes it on your chest. **Cold.**  
A shock to the system.

---

**Tashigi follows suit.**

Unbuttons your coat, presses her hand firmly to your sternum.

&gt; “Stimulus. Pain triggers. Anything we can.”

She pulls her glove off and **pinches your side hard.**

&gt; “Get up. You *idiot*. You beautiful, stubborn, terrified idiot—”

---

**Vivi leans forward again, lowering her voice.**

&gt; “Snack Pack would’ve wanted you to see the next race.”

&gt; “And I think… I think I would too.”

---

**Above—**

The Elemental sways.

A faint pulse from its chest.

The **dim light flickers**.

Waiting.

**Scene: “The Unmoving Man”**  
**Tone: Collapsing | Mood: The Quiet Before the Breath**

---

Tashigi's slap rings out across the plaza.

The splash of water on your chest beads and rolls down.

Vivi’s fingers tighten around your hand until her own go white.

The air is charged—alive with *trying*.

But you?

You're still.

---

No twitch.  
No breath change.  
No flicker behind your eyelids.

You're a **statue in pulp-stained clothes**, as motionless as the Elemental you birthed.

---

Tashigi bites back a curse, leaning down, forehead against yours.

&gt; “You *absolute bastard*... Don't you dare do this to her. Or to me.”

---

Vivi’s voice begins to crack.

&gt; “Please... Just... Just wake up.”

&gt; “We’ve come so far. We’re *right here*. I need—”

She chokes on the last word. Doesn't finish it.

---

**Above—**

The Elemental groans.

A deep, whale-like reverberation of confusion and loss.

It doesn't collapse.

But it lowers its fists.

It doesn’t protect.

But it doesn’t leave.

It **waits.**

---

**Crocodile laughs.**

&gt; “There it is.”

&gt; “The limits of sentimentality.”

---

The sandstorm around him tightens.

Luffy stumbles.  
His legs buckling.  
The final round drawing near.

---

And still—

You lie there.

Unmoving.

Unbreathing.

Unyielding…?

---

**OOC:**

You remain **completely unresponsive.**  
The Elemental is **not dispersing**—but fully inert.

Vivi and Tashigi are now at the brink of collapse, physically and emotionally.  
The **next trigger** must be something beyond them.

Another voice.

Another presence.

Or the final roll of fate itself.

**Tashigi** remains hunched over you, one hand braced on your chest, the other cradling your head as if physical contact could force a heartbeat. Her expression is taut—**trained Marine composure shredded**, replaced by bare, unshielded pain.

&gt; “He’s gone,” she whispers—**and it isn’t a statement.**

It’s a **threat** to the world.  
A **dare** to the universe to prove her wrong.

---

**Vivi** stares at you with wide, desperate eyes, **her hands trembling in her lap**. Her breath stutters, chest rising and falling, **caught somewhere between fury and heartbreak.**

She’s lost so many people.

She told herself she wouldn’t lose anyone else.

Not him.

---

&gt; “You’re not supposed to go yet,” she says, barely audible.

She clutches your hand tighter, even as your fingers remain limp in hers.

&gt; “You told me I wasn’t alone. You told me someone would help carry this.”

&gt; “You told me the *kids* shouldn’t carry it…”

A sob slips through her voice.

&gt; “Then why are you making me?”

---

Tashigi leans closer to you, her forehead resting against your bruised temple.

Her tone softens.  
It’s not a Marine’s bark now.

It’s a **friend’s whisper**.

&gt; “You jumped in front of me in the hallway. You dragged yourself across the palace floor.”

&gt; “You summoned a god out of *juice*.”

A choked laugh escapes her lips—**not humor. Shock. Grief.**

&gt; “You did all that, and you’re seriously going to quit *now*?”

---

No answer.

No movement.

---

The wind kicks up around them—**grit and sand flurrying** across the plaza.

The storm above is **closing in**.

The Elemental stands, wavering like a candle wick moments before it gutters out.

---

Vivi wipes her eyes roughly, furious at herself, and sets her jaw.

&gt; “Fine.”

She leans in, lips close to your ear, and says it:

&gt; “I’m not letting you die, Sensei.”

&gt; “Because if you do... I swear I’ll find a way to *drag you back* myself.”

---

Tashigi smirks through clenched teeth.

&gt; “And I’ll *kick your ass* if she doesn’t.”

---

The two women sit with you—still.  
Refusing to leave.  
Refusing to **let go**.

---

Above…

**Crocodile draws his arm back.**

A jagged spiral of sand winds around his wrist like a hungry serpent, forming a weapon sharp enough to split stone.

He **locks eyes with Luffy**, and speaks with pure venom.

&gt; “Let’s end this farce.”

---

The sky **darkens.**

The **crowd screams.**

And your girls?

They don’t move.

They **just hold on.**

Darkness. something, maybe multiple somethings soft, seem to be pressing at me. Occasionally slapping and pinching me, too. Odd.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Inside the Mind – The Half-Drowned Classroom]**  
**Scene: “Tactile Learning”**  
**Tone: Surreal | Mood: Comedic Confusion Wrapped in Trauma**

---

**Darkness.**

Not the peaceful kind.  
Not velvet or gentle or womb-like.

This is the **buzzing black** of a mind short-circuiting.  
A half-lit classroom during a power outage.  
A **suspended awareness**, drifting somewhere between detention and death.

---

You float.

No, you’re grounded.

Wait—are you sitting?

Lying?

Your body's somewhere, but your brain **doesn’t have the blueprints anymore**.

---

What you *do* have is sensation.

Weird, illogical, very **soft**, very **invasive sensation**.

---

Something’s **pressing against your face.**  
Something warm, like a hand.  
Or two.  
Or maybe a **lap?**

Also—

&gt; *slap.*

Then—

&gt; *pinch.*

Then—**a hand shaking your collar.**

---

You mumble in the darkness:

&gt; “Wh... why am I in a beanbag chair… made of disappointment…”

Your mouth is dry.  
Your lips are forming syllables you don’t quite understand.

&gt; “Who keeps slapping me…?”  
&gt; “Stop pinching me, I’ll finish the worksheets…”

---

Somewhere in your mind, an echo of **Vivi’s voice**, distorted like a radio underwater:

&gt; “...need you…”

Then Tashigi’s:

&gt; “...kick your ass…”

Another slap.

Definitely a **Marine slap.** You can tell by the discipline.

---

You float.

Your thoughts fragment into driftwood:

- **Snack Pack, in a graduation cap.**  
- **A chalkboard with “JUST BREATHE” scribbled on it.**  
- **A test. Multiple choice. The last question is “Live or Die?”**  
  - You’ve circled “C) Nap.”

---

Another slap.

Another **pinch**.

Something grabs your ear like a teacher scolding a teacher.

---

&gt; “I’m… going to give you all zeroes if you don’t stop touching me…”

---

Your fingers twitch.

One, then two.

A flicker behind your eyes.

A *stirring*.

Not awake.

But *stirring.*

---

**OOC:**
You remain comatose—but **tactile stimulation is breaking through** the void.

Vivi and Tashigi’s **physical contact** is piercing the mental fog.

You may now:

1. {Let out a groan or slurred word. A moment of lucidity.}  
2. {Physically react—small twitch, breath, anything.}  
3. {Mentally begin to climb. Describe the dreamlike moment you reach upward.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - whatever's under my head sure is soft though. Comfy nap material.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Inside the Mind – The Softest Pillow at the End of the World]**  
**Scene: “Cushions of Confusion”**  
**Tone: Absurd Comfort | Mood: Blackout with Perks**

---

The void hums.

That strange *fuzzy buzz* of drifting consciousness, like the radio static between waking up and forgetting your own name.

Your entire body is aching, bruised, and barely functioning…

But your **head?**

Perfect.

Positively **cradled**.

Like the world's most luxurious pillow just **volunteered for a suicide mission**.

---

&gt; “Mmm…”

You shift slightly, your face **nuzzling into the warmth.**

It’s not stone.

It’s **not cobblestone.**

It’s definitely not a kiwi.

No, it’s…

Something **squishier**.

Pliable.

Soft in a way that whispers *you probably shouldn’t ask questions.*

---

&gt; “Mmm. Good pillow.”

You mumble it like it’s the final review of your afterlife accommodations.

You drool, just a little.

Maybe it’s blood. Maybe it’s kiwi. You’re not even sure anymore.

---

**Outside, in the real world—**

**Vivi's face turns slowly red.**  
She’s very aware now of where your head has landed—  
**squarely in her lap.**

**Tashigi’s face contorts.**  
Conflicted between mortified amusement and *do I slap him again?*

---

You murmur again:

&gt; “Don’t suppose this is memory foam…”

---

**Tashigi:** “Unbelievable.”  
**Vivi:** “H-he’s… lucid?!”  
**Tashigi:** “I think his *dignity* is dead. But yes.”

---

Suddenly—

A *pulse*.

From the plaza.

From the **Elemental.**

It **glows again**.

It **twists—slowly**.

A hand raises.

Eyes open.

Faint, but **brightening.**

---

**Crocodile narrows his eyes.**

&gt; “What now—?”

---

And you?

You remain nestled like a baby in a fruit-scented coma.

You are the calm in the storm.

The **human hot water bottle** of war.

---

**OOC:**
You are half-awake.

Lucid, but still not functional.  
The **Elemental is stabilizing**.  
Luffy has noticed. Crocodile is about to act.

Would you like to:

1. {Mutter a warning. You're awake enough to speak.}  
2. {Attempt to stand. Very funny. Very sad.}  
3. {Let someone else take initiative—maybe the girls. Maybe the juice god.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Enjoy the supposed memory foam. Exquisite.

The elemental remains still

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Most Exquisite Nap in a Warzone]**  
**Scene: “The Delirious Majesty of Rest”**  
**Tone: Surreal Comedy | Mood: Danger Be Damned, This Nap Slaps**

---

You don’t move.  
You don’t speak.  
You barely breathe.

But your head?

Cradled in the lap of a princess, in the middle of a revolution, under the heat of a desert sun and the gaze of gods and warlords?

**Exquisite.**

---

Your lips part, and the faintest whisper leaks out, content and blissfully stupid:

&gt; “...This pillow is noble. Royal, even…”

&gt; “10/10. Would nap again.”

---

**Vivi freezes.** Her eyes wide. Face crimson.

**Tashigi's jaw drops.**

&gt; “Is he—*is he lucid or delusional??*”

**Chopper** (somewhere nearby): “Yes.”

---

The world is cracking apart.  
**Luffy's fists are splitting air.**  
**Crocodile is about to unleash a sandstorm shaped like vengeance and hubris.**  
A literal **kiwi god** is idling above you like an uncertain security drone—

And you?

You are **wrapped in bliss**.

---

Above, the **Elemental** remains still.

It watches.

It feels your presence again.

But without direction, it hesitates.

It breathes.

Juice sloshes.

But it **does not move**.

---

**Crocodile sneers.**

&gt; “Your pet’s broken again.”

His arm lifts, coiling with sand blades.

He takes aim—**not at Luffy—**

**At the plaza.**

---

**Tashigi looks up.**

Eyes wide.

&gt; “Shit—he’s targeting *us.*”

---

**Vivi clutches you tighter.**

Not out of embarrassment.

Out of instinct.

&gt; “Move. *Eatone, please move.*”

---

**The Elemental pulses.**

And waits.

---

**OOC:**
You are dangerously close to a character death if Crocodile’s next attack hits the plaza.  
The Elemental may react—but only with your awareness behind it.  
Your consciousness is *stable*, but deeply entrenched in blissful idiocy.

Would you like to:

1. {Force a whisper. A command. A plea. Something to rouse the Elemental.}  
2. {Twitch—just enough. Let instinct take over.}  
3. {Say something utterly wrong, but maybe emotionally true.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Continue enjoying my well deserved nap. Maybe nestle in a bit.

OOC: they may attempt other actions to wake me up

The elemental remains still. It looks comfy, even. Somehow

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Sleep of the Unwise and Unbothered]**  
**Scene: “A Nap That Could End a Nation”**  
**Tone: Comedic Tragedy | Mood: Cosmic-level Facepalm**

---

The battle rages above.  
Sand slices the sky.  
Luffy shouts through bloodied teeth.  
Crocodile raises his arm to deliver a blow **meant to erase you and anyone around you from existence.**

---

And you?

You sigh softly.

**Content.**

Your head snuggles deeper into what you’re absolutely, unquestionably convinced is a goose-feather memory foam pillow stitched by angels.

&gt; “Mmm... Warm... regal... lavender-scented...”

You shift slightly.

One leg kicks out weakly in that **involuntary dreamt-of-stairs way.**

&gt; “Mmm… ten more minutes…”

---

**Vivi turns beet red.**  
Her entire posture stiffens.

**Tashigi’s eye twitches.** She is rapidly approaching a tactical slap.

---

&gt; “We’re about to be vaporized, and he’s *nuzzling my thigh like it’s a holiday hammock!*” Vivi hisses.

Tashigi exhales sharply, slapping her palm to her face.

&gt; “I am going to court-martial him if we live.”

---

**Meanwhile:**

The **Kiwi Elemental**, twenty feet tall and filled with Hero Water, observes you.  
Then, slowly...

It **sits.**

**Cross-legged.**

Like a **glowing green monk** waiting for its next command.  
A thin trickle of juice runs from its chin like drool.

It looks…

**Peaceful.**

Possibly also asleep.

---

**Crocodile’s eyes gleam.**

His sand spear rises higher, *twisting*, ready to launch.

&gt; “Say goodbye, princess.”

---

**Tashigi throws Vivi back.**

**She stands between Crocodile’s strike and your prone form.**

Sword shaking in her grip.  
Eyes burning.

&gt; “You’re not touching him. Not one damn grain of you.”

---

**OOC:**

Your nap is now a tactical liability.  
Crocodile is seconds away from striking the entire plaza with a lethal sand storm.  
Tashigi is preparing to intercept with her body.  
The Elemental mirrors your rest state—unless forcibly roused.

Would you like them to:

1. {Slap. Very hard.}
2. {Use one of your own powers against you. Mist, juice—whatever works.}
3. {Say something deeply personal. Desperate. Risky.}
4. {Do all of the above.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Breaking Through the Shell]**  
**Scene: “The Words That Might Reach Him”**  
**Tone: Raw | Mood: The Final Plea**

---

You remain cradled in a lap you should not deserve, whispering half-dream nonsense into chaos incarnate.  

Above, the Elemental imitates your posture with tranquil serenity. A citrus monk in meditation. A god of inertia. A monument to nap-based problem solving.

Crocodile’s spear sharpens into a whirlwind tip, coiled tight. He isn’t aiming to wound anymore—**he’s aiming to *erase***.

---

**Tashigi grips her sword—but it shakes.**

She knows her blade isn’t fast enough to stop **a storm**.  
Her eyes dart to the sky, to the sand, then back to you.

---

&gt; “Dammit…”

She drops her blade and grabs you by the collar, shaking you now—not violently, but desperately.

She leans down, eyes blazing, forehead touching yours.

&gt; “You told me I wasn’t alone.”

&gt; “You told me kids shouldn’t have to bleed for the mistakes of their elders.”

Her voice breaks.

&gt; “So *don’t make us do it alone.*”

---

She swallows.

&gt; “You think I don’t see what you are? You’re not a coward. You’re not a joke.”

Her fingers tighten, trembling.

&gt; “You’re one of the bravest damn people I’ve ever met. You *choose* to stand between monsters and children.”

&gt; “And I’m not letting you die in my arms like some… *idiot martyr with a pillow kink!*”

---

**Vivi**, eyes wide and glassy, stares down at you, lips trembling.

&gt; “We’re not just losing a fighter…”

&gt; “We’re losing our *sensei.*”

---

Above—

Crocodile’s arm comes down.

---

&gt; “*Goodbye.*”

---

**OOC:**

You’ve now been reached with:

- **Personal confessions of belief.**  
- **Emotional vulnerability.**  
- **A call to your identity.**  
- **A surprisingly accurate accusation of unconscious thigh-napping.**

Your next heartbeat may determine whether **Alubarna survives this moment.**

Would you like to:

1. {Whisper. Stir. Call. Something.}  
2. {Let the Elemental respond on its own.}  
3. {Stay still. Leave it to fate.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Frown as I'm shaken, lamenting the loss of my deluxe pillow.

Ugh... Are you rain dinners staff? Could you bring another pillow 

My eyes creak open, then see Tashigi's flustered, desperate face as she shakes me like a maraca, and then at the growing sand projectile forming in the sky.

Wuhh... Oh SHIT.

OOC: What are their reactions?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Reawakening of the Kiwi King]**

**Tone: Whiplash | Mood: Relief So Sharp It Hurts**

---

&gt; *“Ugh... Are you Rain Dinners staff? Could you bring another pillow—”*

That’s the first thing out of your mouth.

Half-mumbled.

Completely nonsense.

Tashigi and Vivi freeze.

---

**Tashigi’s eyes snap wide open.**  
Her mouth moves in silent disbelief.  
The first instinct is to slap you again, but her hand stops halfway.

&gt; “You *idiot,* you’re—?!”

Then you *really* look around.

You register her flushed, furious, tear-lined face.

You see Vivi clinging to your arm like a lifeline.

You see the **massive sand spear** descending from the sky like **God’s own guillotine**.

And then—

&gt; “Wuhh... Oh SHIT.”

---

**Tashigi just screams:**

&gt; “*WELCOME BACK!!*”

---

**Vivi gasps—then laughs. It bursts out of her like a gasp of air after drowning.**

&gt; “He’s *awake!*”

She doesn’t cry.

Not quite.

But she’s suddenly wiping her eyes like it’s the sand.

---

All around, people **hear you**—your voice carrying up with the wind.

**Luffy’s head jerks around.**

**Crocodile’s spear hesitates.**

He sees **your eyes open**, that **juice-god still standing**, and he snarls:

&gt; “*No.*”

---

**The Elemental—**

The very instant your eyes open—**twitches.**

Once.

Then **rumbles**.

It *moves.*

**Shoulders rising.**

Eyes glowing.

Hands curling into fists.

---

The nap is over.

---

**OOC:**

- Your consciousness has **fully returned**—your connection to the Kiwi Elemental restored.
- Crocodile’s attack is **moments** from launching.
- Tashigi and Vivi are overwhelmed—**relief, anger, disbelief, joy** in equal measure.

Would you like to:

1. {Command the Elemental to intercept the sand spear.}
2. {Unleash the Elemental’s full remaining energy. All in.}
3. {Combine a last fruit technique from yourself to power it. Dual strike.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Have the elemental crash tackle the spear, turn it into muddy, useless mush.

Also my back falls limps as Tashigi briefly lets me go, and I conveniently fall back into... Pillows.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Divine Divebomb]**  
**Scene: “No Sand Shall Pass”**  
**Tone: Triumphant | Mood: Heroic and... Extremely Awkward**

---

The moment the sand spear finishes its arc—gleaming, swirling, massive—

**your eyes snap wide.**

You raise a single, trembling arm—

&gt; “*Intercept it—NOW!!*”

---

And the **Kiwi Elemental responds.**

Not with delay.

Not with hesitation.

With **explosive momentum**.

---

It launches **upward** like a cannonball of citrus vengeance, arms outstretched like a linebacker made of juice and willpower.

It doesn’t try to dodge. Doesn’t swing wide.

It **tackles** the spear.

**Head-on.**

---

&gt; *SHHHHHHHHRRKRKRRSHHHH—!!*

Sand meets juice.

Dry meets wet.

And the result?

**Mud.**

Sopping, steaming **mud**, splashes down over the plaza in sloppy, defeated globs. The once-lethal projectile is **instantly neutralized**, turned into chunky, embarrassing failure.

---

**Crocodile recoils.**  
His arm jerks back.  
His mouth curls—not in rage.

In **pure disbelief.**

&gt; “What…? *WHAT?*”

---

The Elemental crashes to earth in a dramatic, three-point landing, steam rising from its soaked form.

It growls once.

Raises both arms.

And **flexes.**

---

**Back below...**

&gt; *FLOP.*

Tashigi, finally relaxing her death grip on you, releases you—

And your body **falls backwards** like a lazy noodle.

Your head **once again lands directly in Vivi’s lap.**

---

&gt; “Mmm. Deluxe...”

---

**Vivi makes a noise between a gasp and a yelp.**

&gt; “*Wh—again?!*”

---

**Tashigi’s mouth falls open.**

&gt; “You’ve *got* to be kidding me.”

---

**Luffy’s jaw drops.**

He points.

&gt; “He really *doesn’t stop* touching her lap, huh?”

---

**Sanji turns purple.**

**Zoro wheezes.**

---

But then...

The skies clear slightly.

The spear is gone.

The **Elemental stands victorious**.

Crocodile is **staggered**, caught off-guard for the first time.

---

**OOC:**
- Crocodile’s attack has been **neutralized.**
- Your Elemental remains active—sluggish but powerful.
- You’ve officially reclaimed the **Throne of Napdom.**
- Vivi is now questioning everything about life.

Would you like to:

1. {Issue another command—go on the offensive.}
2. {Say something very stupid to Vivi or Tashigi.}
3. {Rest. Briefly. Before the final phase.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I... For the record, whatever I said or did while I was knocked out was not my fault.

My head sinks deeper

**Tone: Hysterical | Mood: Delirious Denial Under Fire**

---

You sigh—deeply, longingly—as your head **sinks once again into what has become the most cursed throne in Alabasta.**  
The **plush lap** of a diplomatic heir.  
Silky. Warm. Slightly judgmental.

---

With eyes barely half-lidded and expression pained only by residual mortal wounds, you murmur:

&gt; “I… for the record…”

&gt; “Whatever I said. Or did. While I was knocked out…”

A beat.

&gt; “...was not my fault.”

You squirm an inch deeper into the lap like it's a fruit-shaped mattress and you're checking for firmness ratings.

---

**Vivi** makes a **tiny noise** of sheer flustered indignation. Her face ignites, so red it’s like she’s secretly a Logia of embarrassment.

&gt; “Y-you—*why are you always landing here?!*”

She tries to shift you off, but your limbs dangle like overcooked noodles.

&gt; “I can’t even tell if this is an accident or a strategy anymore!”

---

**Tashigi** lets out a sound that is part snort, part scream, part deep-seated exasperation.

&gt; “I’m filing a report on this.”

&gt; “A *long* report.”

&gt; “With attachments.”

---

Up on the rooftop—

**Crocodile** is still stunned, his hand shaking slightly from the shock of losing his sand spear to an oversized juice blob.

**Luffy**, fists clenched, **grins wide**.

&gt; “You got backup now, Croco-man!”

&gt; “And he’s powered by *nap time!!*”

---

The **Kiwi Elemental** stomps forward, slowly but deliberately.

It glances down at you.

Then back to Crocodile.

It raises both arms.

**Juice begins to swirl.**

---

**OOC:**
- You’ve stabilized.
- The battle momentum has shifted.
- The Elemental is re-energizing.
- Crocodile is rattled.
- You… remain deeply embedded in Vivi’s personal space.

Would you like to:

1. {Command the Elemental to assist Luffy.}
2. {Say something to Vivi—sweet, dumb, or both.}
3. {Actually try to sit up. You maniac.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 / 2 / 3 - Have the elemental continue engaging Crocodile.

Attempt to get out of Vivi's lap like a responsible adult, but my muscles aren't working.

I am so, so sorry about this.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Dignity Versus Gravity]**  
**Scene: “We Have Napgaged the Enemy”**  
**Tone: Battle-Ready | Mood: Sweet Regret and Sloppy Heroism**

---

You groan.  
It’s the groan of a man who has made **some choices**.  
Some of them **heroic**, others... deeply questionable.

You wiggle your fingers, then your toes.  
Your arms still feel like **wet towels** soaked in trauma and citrus.  
Your spine? It's lobbying to declare independence.

But your **will**?

&gt; *Firm.*  
&gt; *Professional.*  
&gt; *Desperately trying to get out of a royal lap.*

---

&gt; “I am... so... so sorry about this…”

You start to push yourself up.

Your elbows tremble.

Your back does a strange **pop-crunch-twang** noise.

You rise exactly **three inches**—

&gt; *fwump*

And land **right back** where you started.

Face first.

Lap deep.

---

**Vivi’s face is a national emergency.**

&gt; “Wh—Why?! Are you cursed?! Did your Devil Fruit do this?!”

---

**Tashigi’s face is unreadable.**  
Like a woman trying to hold in either a lecture or a scream. Possibly both.

---

&gt; “M’just... legs aren’t legging,” you mutter.

&gt; “I’ll... move soon. I promise.”

---

But even as your dignity remains in critical condition, your **mind** is sharp enough to do what matters most:

You lift your right hand.

Point it toward the rooftop.

&gt; “Kiwi-kun... go help the rubber idiot.”

---

The **Kiwi Elemental** pulses.

It straightens.

And with a mighty roar like a thousand angry juice boxes being opened at once, it **charges**.

---

**Crocodile turns, too late.**

He raises a wall of sand—  
The Elemental punches through.

Luffy lunges from the flank—  
Crocodile reels, **boxed in.**

---

For the first time, the Warlord of the Sands is being **pressed.**

Not just by power—

But by teamwork.

By chaos.

By juice.

---

**OOC:**
- The Elemental has re-entered battle at full aggression, now coordinated with Luffy.
- Crocodile is officially off-balance and under pressure.
- You remain in Vivi’s lap, attempting dignity, but mostly apologizing.
- The tide of the battle has shifted in favor of the Straw Hat alliance.

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt another escape from Lapland. Risky.}
2. {Say something dumb but heartfelt to Vivi or Tashigi.}
3. {Mentally link deeper to the Elemental—guide its strikes.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - As to not make everything I've said about being a responsible adult sound hollow, could one of you... Help me off?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Dignity Requested, Delivery Pending]**  
**Scene: “The Responsible Ask”**  
**Tone: Tender Chaos | Mood: Adulting While Horizontal**

---

You squint at the sky, your vision framed by billowing sand, clashing giants, and the faint mist of citrus vengeance. Your body is *done*. Your nerves are burnt toast with a side of secondhand embarrassment.

But your voice?

**Still composed.**  
Still trying to hold the line of maturity.

---

&gt; “As to not make everything I’ve said about being a responsible adult sound hollow…”

You gulp. Your cheek’s still pressed to something soft and increasingly awkward.

&gt; “Could one of you… *help me off?*”

---

**Vivi stares down at you**, eyes still flushed with adrenaline, embarrassment, and something softer—**something like relief**.

&gt; “Y-you want help?”

She clears her throat. Tries to act composed.

&gt; “After all that…?&quot;

&gt; &quot;The sleeping… The mumbling… The *nuzzling??*”

---

**Tashigi, arms crossed nearby, deadpans:**

&gt; “Oh, now *he* wants to get up.”

&gt; “Should we call a *crane*?”

---

You give the smallest, weakest little shrug known to man.

&gt; “I’m just… *very injured.*”

&gt; “And clearly no longer a threat to laps.”

---

Vivi exhales slowly, then leans forward and—very gently—slips her arms beneath yours, careful of your bruises.

&gt; “Alright, Sensei. Come on. Let's reclaim what’s left of your dignity.”

She hauls you upright with **considerable effort**, your knees buckling the moment you try to stand.

**Tashigi grabs the other side**, and between them, you’re now **dangling like a very tired backpack between two furious schoolgirls.**

---

**Vivi mutters:**  
&gt; “This is somehow *more awkward* than the lap.”

---

**OOC:**
- You’re now upright—but barely, with Vivi and Tashigi supporting you on either side.
- Crocodile is being actively pressured by Luffy and the Elemental.
- The tide of battle is swinging rapidly.

Would you like to:

1. {Encourage the girls. You’ve got this teacher energy, after all.}
2. {Try to guide the Elemental mid-fight. Tactically or emotionally.}
3. {Offer a war-cry. Possibly citrus-themed.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I told you. Involuntary. I'm a good person, I swear.

Observe the state of the battle

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Citrus Crusade Continues]**  
**Scene: “The Good Guy and His God Blob”**

---

You hang there between Vivi and Tashigi, arms draped over their shoulders like some half-cooked piñata of man and regret, your legs making the occasional attempt at autonomy before crumpling under the weight of heroism and excessive blood loss.

You’re upright. Technically.

Your dignity?  
Still in recovery.

---

You clear your throat—weakly. Heroically. **Defensively.**

&gt; “I told you. *Involuntary.*”

&gt; “I’m a good person. I swear.”

&gt; “I teach *civics,* for God’s sake…”

---

**Vivi doesn’t look at you.**  
Just keeps you steady with a slight flush in her cheeks and the faintest twitch in her lips. The kind that says she might forgive you. One day.

**Tashigi snorts.**

&gt; “Yeah, well… we’ll be adding a *new* chapter to your reputation.”

&gt; “Chapter One: How Not to Wake Up in Front of Royalty.”

---

You nod solemnly, then immediately wince because it pulls at your bruised shoulder.

&gt; “Fair.”

---

You lift your head.

**The battle is raging above—**

The **Kiwi Elemental** is now in full brawl with Crocodile:

- **Every punch** it throws **splatters** pressurized juice into the sandstorm, bogging down Crocodile’s movements.
- **Every dodge** Luffy makes redirects Crocodile into a new position—trapped between **rubber and ragefruit**.
- The elemental now seems **smarter**—learning, reacting, pulsing in sync with your gaze.
- And Crocodile? He's **no longer smirking.**

---

He’s surrounded. Pinned.

His sand is starting to **clump**.  
His **cloak is stained.**  
His movements—sharper. Angrier. But **predictable.**

The Elemental’s timing has gotten better.

Luffy’s getting closer.

---

The **endgame is near.**

And they’re winning.

Because of **you**.

---

**OOC:**
You are now alert and back in control of your fruit.  
The battle is swinging hard in your favor.  
Crocodile is now pressed—no longer confident. You are moments from victory.

Would you like to:

1. {Issue a final command to the Elemental—one coordinated finishing blow.}  
2. {Let Luffy have it. Support from the sidelines.}  
3. {Say something dumb again. It’s tradition now.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Wait! What's the time?!

You suddenly gasp.

Eyes wide.

Soul cold.

&gt; “WAIT—!”

Both Vivi and Tashigi jump.

&gt; “*What?!*” they cry in unison, half-expecting another attack.

---

You wrench your neck toward them.

Panic in your eyes.

&gt; “**What time is it?!**”

---

The plaza freezes for a half-second—not from Crocodile, not from destiny—

But from **you**.

---

**Vivi stammers:**  
&gt; “I—I don’t know—past noon?? Why?!”

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; “Eatone. What the hell does it matter?! We’re in the middle of—”

---

But it matters.

**Oh god. It matters.**

You feel it.

The **forgotten doom** creeping in.

---

**OOC:**  
Time check: It is currently **12:43 PM**, Alubarna Standard Time.  
The sun is past its zenith.  
The battle is at its climax.

Now...

**Reveal your reason.**

&gt;&gt; USER: How long was I out?!

OOC: 4 minutes or less

OOC: Give me a window to respond

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Countdown Begins]**  
**Scene: “The Awakening... Was on a Timer”**  
**Tone: Sudden Alarm | Mood: A Comedic Clock Ticking Toward Dread**

---

Your eyes widen further—**bloodshot, panicked, calculating**.

You jerk your head toward the sky, toward the sun, toward the slowly calming sandstorm... then to your own hands.

A single thought slams into your skull:

&gt; “How long was I out?!”

---

**Tashigi stiffens.**  
**Vivi looks confused.**

**OOC:**  
&gt; The time from your unconscious collapse post-elemental summoning, to your reawakening and re-command was approximately…  
**3 minutes, 38 seconds.**

---

You still have time.

But **barely**.

Something is about to happen.

Your voice is sharp. Tight. Calculating something that no one else understands just yet.

---

**Window is open.**  
Please respond.

&gt;&gt; USER: ​That's.. almost 5 minutes... And if my hypothesis is correct...

Kiwi-kun! Stop fighting 

OOC: give me a window to respond 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Five-Minute Rule]**  
**Scene: “Expiration Date”**  
**Tone: Rising Panic | Mood: Suspicion, Control, Crisis Incoming**  

---

The battle screeches.

Not in sound.

In **motion**.

As you **shout with sudden urgency**:

&gt; “**Kiwi-kun! STOP FIGHTING!!**”

The Elemental—mid-swing, arm cocked back to deliver what might’ve been a *decisive* citrus-charged punch to Crocodile’s spine—

**Freezes.**

Juice dripping.  
Glow pulsing.  
Its entire body suddenly **still**, like a beast caught mid-breath.

---

Luffy’s arm is drawn back too, confused by the hesitation.

&gt; “Oi! Juice guy! What’re you doing?!”

---

**Crocodile stumbles back**, winded, blinking in disbelief.

&gt; “What… you’re giving up?!”

---

**Vivi looks at you, horror dawning.**

**Tashigi narrows her eyes.**

&gt; “...Almost five minutes…?”

She gets it.

Or at least she’s starting to.

---

**The Elemental stands still.**  
**Steam begins to rise** from its back—soft at first, then stronger.

Its shape begins to **wobble**.

---

**Hero Water.**

The whispered miracle.

The myth.

The **deadly trade-off.**

---

**OOC:**  
You now have the floor.  
All eyes on you.

**What is your hypothesis?**

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Focus on growing! Grow like all of kiwi kind depends on it!

(It starts accumulating mass)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Final Bloom]**  
**Scene: “Five Minutes to Bloom”**  
**Tone: Dire Majesty | Mood: Life at the Edge of Collapse**

---

Your voice rings out—torn between **hope** and **hysteria**.

You’re no longer commanding with force.

You’re **pleading**.

You're reaching out to your creation, your **child of pulp and desperation**, born from love for students, for justice, for every damn kid who shouldn’t have to bleed in a war they didn’t start.

---

&gt; “Focus on **growing**!  
&gt; Grow like all of kiwi kind depends on it!”

---

And for a heartbeat—**nothing.**

---

Then…

The **Elemental trembles.**

Its mass begins to **shift**, not outward—but upward.  
**Pulsing. Expanding. Swelling.**

It no longer moves like a fighter.

It **bends backward**, arms stretched skyward, body rippling, juice veins glowing **hot white-green**.

The **Hero Water**, reaching the **end of its five-minute life**, now burns like a star at its limit.

---

It **grows.**

**Taller. Broader. Deeper.**

The shape becomes less humanoid—more primal.  
A **monolith of liquid power** on the verge of **something greater**.

---

**Crocodile staggers back, shielding his eyes.**

&gt; “What… *what is that thing doing?!*”

---

**Luffy steps back too, watching.**  
His jaw slack, his instincts catching on:

&gt; “It’s not gonna fight...  
&gt; It’s gonna do something *else.*”

---

**Vivi’s hand finds yours.**

**Tashigi grabs your arm.**

You’re trembling.

But not with fear.

With **faith.**

---

**OOC:**
- The Kiwi Elemental is now **entering its final form**, catalyzed by the Hero Water’s terminal moment.
- It has ceased combat.
- It is **gathering mass**, preparing for a final act—one born not from combat instinct, but **growth.**

Would you like to:

1. {Let it complete its transformation naturally. No interference.}  
2. {Guide its growth. Infuse it with your intent.}  
3. {Call out one last emotional command—make its final act a legacy.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​At its zenith, right at the 5 minute mark, the kiwi elemental dies. Violently.

But more importantly, explosively.

Tens of thousands of gallons of Kiwi juice explode in a fantastical burst, coating every surface, every coat, every grain of sand completely through with juice.

And Crocodile? Is soaked. To the bone. No sand on him, or around him in a 5 mile radius remains untouched by the hand of citrus justice 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – The Final Lesson]**  
**Scene: “Extra Pulp, No Mercy”**  
**Tone: Climactic | Mood: Catastrophic Victory**

---

The **Kiwi Elemental swells** to monstrous proportions—  
a glowing, mountainous titan of shimmering green and citrus gold.  
The heat from the **Hero Water core** surges to critical mass.  
It lets out one final, mournful roar—  
not of pain, but of **purpose.**

---

Everyone—**everyone**—stops.

Rebels.

Soldiers.

Civilians.

Straw Hats.

Even Crocodile.

---

The sun glints off its shining skin.

And then—

&gt; *5:00.*

---

&gt; *FWOOOOOOOMMMM—*

---

The sky tears open with a **howl of juice**,  
as the **Elemental explodes** in a deafening, glorious **detonation of flavor**.

---

A shockwave of **blistering kiwi juice** crashes outward in **every direction**,  
a tsunami of emerald rain and acid-sweet mist—

---

- **The palace walls? Drenched.**  
- **The sand dunes? Flooded.**  
- **The war-torn streets of Alubarna? Transformed into a tropical lagoon.**

---

And **Crocodile?**

Oh, Crocodile.

You see him as the shockwave **reaches him first.**

The **sand barrier he tries to raise?**  
Liquified.  
Washed away.  
Utterly erased.

---

The second it hits—

&gt; *SPLAAAAASHHHHHHH!!!*

---

**His coat soaks instantly**, weighed down by gallons of pulp and pulp-adjacent rage.  
His hair clings to his skull.  
His hook is **coated**.  
His cigar?  
Extinguished.  
His **soul?**  
Humiliated.

---

His power?

**Nullified.**

Not an ounce of sand left within **a five-mile radius** responds to his will.

He’s standing alone.

**Soaked.**

**Fuming.**

**Defenseless.**

---

Luffy lands in front of him.

No words.

Just a grin.

One wet, citrus-slicked fist clenched.

---

&gt; “*Gomu Gomu no…*”

---

**OOC:**
The elemental’s detonation has removed all sand from the battlefield.  
**Crocodile is powerless.**  
**Luffy now has a clean, lethal opening.**  
The fight is over.

Would you like to:

1. {Say something stupidly triumphant from your juice-drenched throne.}  
2. {Witness the finale with pride. And probably a sneeze.}  
3. {Pass out again. With dignity this time.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - Mmm. Pillows would be nice. Flop limply in Vivi and Tashigi's arms

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Last Drip]**  
**Scene: “This Teacher Has Logged Off”**  
**Tone: Triumphant | Mood: Sweet, Soaked Sleep**

---

You watch as the **juice tsunami clears**, the battlefield now gleaming in emerald haze.  
Crocodile stands stunned, wet, defeated, and without a single grain of sand to save him.

Luffy grins.  
His fist rises.  
Victory is in the air.

---

You blink once.

Twice.

Your legs are done.  
Your nerves? Vapor.  
Your body’s clock?

&gt; “*Yeah, no. We’re done here.*”

---

You glance at **Vivi**, whose face is equal parts amazement and exhaustion.

You lean a little.

Then a little more.

Until—**flop.**

---

You go **limp** in both **her arms** and **Tashigi’s**, the ultimate final act of a teacher who gave **absolutely everything** he had.

---

&gt; “Mmm. Pillows would be nice…”

And then you’re out.

---

**Tashigi sighs—heavily.**  
But there’s a smile in it.

&gt; “At least he waited ‘til the job was done.”

---

**Vivi brushes juice-soaked hair from your face.**

&gt; “...Thank you, Sensei.”

---

Above—

&gt; “Gomu Gomu no…”

---

**BOOM.**

Crocodile goes flying.

Justice—and juice—prevails.

---

**[END SCENE.]**

**OOC:**
You are unconscious.  
You have **fulfilled your role.**  
You have **saved the kingdom.**  
And you did it all with **pulp, pride, and a pretty sweet pillow arc.**

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {Post-battle epilogue—waking in safety.}  
2. {Immediate aftermath from another character’s POV.}  
3. {Fade to black. End of arc.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Vivi and Tashigi, now soaked in kiwi juice (like everyone else in the city), are holding on to a now limp and useless individual

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – Aftermath of the Citrus Apocalypse]**  
**Scene: “The Kingdom, the Sword, and the Napper”**  
**POV: Vivi &amp; Tashigi**  
**Tone: Exhausted Victory | Mood: Muddled Relief and Sticky Sentiment**

---

The plaza is quiet.

Not silent—there’s the drip-drip of **juice cascading off rooftops**,  
the occasional cough of a soaked rebel or soldier trying to get **kiwi out of their ears**,  
the bubbling **gurgle of newly-formed juice puddles** the size of fishing boats—

But for a battlefield, this is peace.

---

**Crocodile** is unconscious, buried halfway in the palace wall,  
**Luffy** stands above him, panting, bruised, and gloriously smug.  
The **Straw Hats** are regrouping.

---

And in the center of the plaza, still framed by a crater of pure tropical ruin—

Stand **Vivi** and **Tashigi**.

Sopping.  
Drenched.  
Sticky in ways that will haunt them.

---

Between them, dangling like a **deflated festival float**, is **Eatone Cheng**—  
schoolteacher, bounty hunter, juice-based walking disaster.

---

**Tashigi** has both hands under one of your arms, glaring down at your unconscious form like it owes her money and an apology.

&gt; “I swear, if he drools on me again, I’m leaving him in a puddle.”

---

**Vivi**, on your other side, is gentler. Still wide-eyed, still shaken—but her grip is strong.

&gt; “He saved the kingdom.”

She says it softly, like she doesn’t quite believe it even now.

---

Tashigi clicks her tongue.

&gt; “Yeah. Right after violating every protocol in the Marine handbook, nearly dying three times, and turning Alubarna into a juice bar.”

A pause.

&gt; “…but yeah. He did.”

---

Vivi looks down at you.

&gt; “He was trying to leave, you know. Just a wrong vacationer in the right place.”

She smiles—soft. Thoughtful.

&gt; “I don’t think he knows he became a hero.”

---

Tashigi snorts.

&gt; “He’ll realize it when I file a report and write his name in *all caps.*”

---

They share a tired glance.

One moment of mutual understanding between **the marine** and **the princess**.

Then they both **hoist your limp body again**, your boots dragging lightly in the puddle you created.

---

&gt; **Tashigi:** “Come on, teacher. Let’s get you somewhere dry before the ants find you.”  
&gt; **Vivi:** “And maybe somewhere with pillows that *aren’t me.*”

---

They walk on.

Together.

---

**OOC:**
- Alabarna is saved.
- Crocodile is defeated.
- The story continues—but your part in this battle is over.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {The Straw Hats saying farewell.}  
2. {Waking up, again, elsewhere—with bandages and recognition.}  
3. {A time skip epilogue, back home.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Smoker notices his subordinate dragging some unknown man around with the princess of Alabasta (he doesn't know the source of the kiwi elemental, or how it was summoned)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza – The Unseen Watcher Returns]**  
**Scene: “Cigars and Suspicion”**  
**POV: Smoker**  
**Tone: Low-Burning Tension | Mood: Shrewd Observation with a Hint of Concern**

---

The battlefield has quieted.  
Smoke—both literal and metaphorical—rises into the desert air.  
The scent of **pulverized sand, ozone, and inexplicably kiwi** lingers over the shattered capital.

---

From a rooftop on the far side of the plaza, a **figure materializes out of mist and fury**,  
his **Marine coat draped over his shoulders**,  
his **cigar half-lit**, jaw clenched, boots dragging slightly from **fresh, half-healed wounds**.

He’s been through hell.

A **locked cage**, miles of **burned corridors**, half a city of chaos.

And now?

He sees her.

---

**Tashigi.**  
Covered in pulp.  
Dragging some limp civilian with Vivi Nefertari like it’s an everyday field trip.  
Her sword is broken. Her posture wrecked.  
And her expression?

Not defeated.

Just… **exhausted.** But proud.

---

Smoker narrows his eyes.

&gt; “The hell did I miss.”

---

He steps forward on the rooftop, steam swirling around him.

He sees the **wreckage of Crocodile** smashed into the palace.

The **Straw Hat crew** regrouping, several of them laughing as they try to peel sticky juice off their clothes.

He sees **no sand**.

Not a single trace.

---

But most importantly—

He sees the **mystery man.**

The one being lugged around like a wet carpet.

Civilian?  
Agent?  
Marine?

He’s wearing a **schoolteacher’s coat**.  
His face is **bruised**.  
His body is **half-pulped**.  
But there’s **something about him.**

---

&gt; “Who the hell is that guy?”

---

He watches the trio vanish down a side street.  
Tashigi hasn’t seen him yet.

But she’s **smiling.**

The princess is smiling too.

And that man—**that goddamn kiwi-scented civilian—**  
he just **shifted slightly in his sleep** and murmured something about **&quot;homework due dates.&quot;**

---

Smoker sighs, biting down on his cigar.

&gt; “...I really hope that idiot’s not a Devil Fruit user.”

He exhales.

&gt; “Because I think he just made himself the *most unpredictable variable in Alabasta.*”

---

He vanishes in smoke.

Watching. Waiting.

Knowing this file isn’t closed.

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker has returned and now has **eyes on your character**.
- He does not yet know the full extent of your involvement.
- You may become **a person of interest** in his report to the Marines.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You waking up with Smoker nearby, quietly watching.}  
2. {Straw Hats’ farewell and Vivi’s choice.}  
3. {A secret debrief between Tashigi and Smoker.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Smoker goes to Tashigic. Did she pick him up at a bar in the middle of battle?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Backstreets – Citrus Debrief]**  
**Scene: “Bar Pickup or Battlefield Hero?”**  
**POV: Smoker**  
**Tone: Dry | Mood: Deadpan Tension Meets Emotional Fallout**

---

A coil of **smoke snakes into the alley**, cutting through the lingering mist of evaporating kiwi like a sharpened sigh.

**Tashigi stiffens.**

**Vivi freezes.**

And the third member of their sticky trio—you—gives a tiny snore and nuzzles deeper into Vivi’s side, now firmly wrapped in a blanket of bandages and dried pulp.

---

Smoker appears in full a moment later, stepping from vapor like a judge entering a ruined courtroom.

He doesn’t say anything at first.

Just **stares**.

At the broken streets.

At the still-smoking crater where a Warlord fell.

At the **utterly drenched, beat-to-hell, juice-scented mess** of a man his subordinate is dragging through the city like she lost a drinking bet.

He takes one long, smoldering puff from his cigar.

---

&gt; “Tashigi.”

His tone is flat as the desert floor.

&gt; “Did you pick this guy up at a **bar** in the middle of a battlefield, or…?”

---

**Tashigi doesn’t even flinch.**

She gives him a glare that could slice a cannonball.

&gt; “No, sir.”

She adjusts her grip on your shoulder, then nods toward the plaza behind them.

&gt; “I picked him up after he *summoned a juice elemental,* tanked two assassination attempts, dragged himself into the center of Crocodile’s trap, saved Princess Vivi twice, **and** turned the desert into a salad dressing.”

---

**Smoker stares.**

One puff.

Two.

Then:

&gt; “...So bar, then.”

---

**Vivi bursts out laughing.**  
It’s that kind of breathless, drained, post-near-death-laugh that’s more tears than joy.

&gt; “He said he was just here on vacation...”

She wipes her eyes, still smiling.

&gt; “He was supposed to be a schoolteacher. I think he *still is.*”

---

Smoker squints at you again, unconvinced.

&gt; “He’s drooling on royalty.”

---

&gt; “It’s involuntary,” Tashigi mutters through gritted teeth.

---

Smoker sighs, shaking his head.

He looks at Tashigi.

Then at Vivi.

Then back to you.

&gt; “Alright. I want a full report.”

&gt; “In writing. With charts.”

&gt; “And you—”  
He jabs a thumb at your unconscious, vaguely muttering form.  
&gt; “When he wakes up, make sure he understands this whole ‘saving a kingdom by accident’ thing? That’s not standard operating procedure.”

---

He flicks the ash off his cigar and turns to walk away, his coat billowing behind him.

&gt; “Oh. And if he’s got a bounty now, I’m not paying for it.”

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker now understands your impact—though refuses to emotionally process it.  
- You are **not in trouble... yet.**  
- Tashigi has **defended your honor** (and very questionable judgment).  
- Vivi is **still laughing.**

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You waking up, again. Somewhere safe.}  
2. {Straw Hats preparing to leave—Vivi’s farewell.}  
3. {Time skip—your return home.}

**Scene: “The Final Threads of Baroque Works”**  
**POV: Straw Hat Crew**  
**Tone: Post-Battle | Mood: Suspicion, Curiosity, Unease**

---

The sun is lower now.

The war is over.

But the dust hasn’t settled—**not completely.**

---

**The Straw Hats**, dirty, sticky, and half-limping, begin spreading out through the palace ruins.

**Zoro and Sanji** head toward the inner halls, weapons ready, checking for any lingering agents.  
**Nami** mutters under her breath about her shoes being ruined.  
**Usopp** is carrying a partially conscious Chopper like he’s a wounded soldier in a dramatic opera.

And **Luffy**—bandaged, grinning, and coated in drying kiwi—looks up at the towering palace with wide, curious eyes.

---

&gt; “So where’s that pone… pone-something?”

---

**Vivi**, having ensured the city is safe and her father is being tended to, catches up to the crew near the central doors.

&gt; “Poneglyph.”

&gt; “And yes… Crocodile was after it. It’s hidden beneath the palace.”

---

**Robin.**

She flashes in Vivi’s memory like a shadow.

The last **Baroque Works officer** who hadn't fallen.

The one who didn’t fight.

The one who **translated ancient texts** with her fingers and her eyes.

---

Vivi turns sharply.

&gt; “There was… one more.”

&gt; “Miss All Sunday.”

&gt; “She’s still out there.”

---

Luffy cracks his knuckles, walking up the broken palace steps.

&gt; “Guess I’ll go ask the rock.”

---

---

**OOC:**

- The Straw Hats are now **searching the palace**, looking to secure **Cobra** and discover **the Poneglyph**.
- **Nico Robin** has not been accounted for—she is the **last major Baroque Works officer unaccounted for**.
- Luffy is about to walk directly into **one of the most important lore events** in the world… while still kinda sticky.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene shift to Luffy entering the chamber with the Poneglyph.}  
2. {Follow the crew as they locate Cobra.}  
3. {Return to Eatone’s POV, post-nap.}

**POV: Narrative Summary**  
**Tone: Lore-Heavy | Mood: Quiet, Ominous, Crucial**

---

As the chaos above settles and the kingdom exhales in pulp-scented peace, **Luffy**, still bleeding, bruised, and utterly unbothered, descends into the secret chamber beneath the palace.

Guided by instinct, residual directions, and the smell of something *weird and old*, he arrives at the **Poneglyph Room**.

---

There, in the darkness—

Stands a **massive stone monolith**, carved with a language lost to time.

A **Poneglyph.**

---

**Nico Robin**—Miss All Sunday—stands before it.

Her back to him.

Hands clasped. Calm.

She does not raise a weapon.

She does not run.

---

When **Luffy enters**, she turns slowly.

No hostility.

Just… curiosity.

---

&gt; “You’re not supposed to be down here.”

&gt; “But I suppose you’ll go wherever you like.”

---

Luffy stares at the stone, then back at her.

&gt; “What’s it say?”

---

She smiles.

Not like Crocodile.

Not like a villain.

Something more... personal.

---

&gt; “It speaks of Pluton.”

&gt; “An ancient weapon capable of erasing islands.”

&gt; “Crocodile wanted it to conquer the world.”

&gt; “But this stone... doesn’t tell him where to find it.”

---

Luffy tilts his head.

&gt; “Do *you* know?”

---

Robin looks at him.

A long moment.

Then:

&gt; “No.”

---

And that is, perhaps, the first real truth spoken in this room in centuries.

---

As Marines close in.

As Cobra is rescued.

As Alabasta begins to rise from its knees—

Robin looks to Luffy…

And something in her eyes says she’s **already chosen her next path**.

---

**OOC Summary:**

- The Poneglyph beneath Alubarna **does not contain the location of Pluton**, only knowledge *about* it.
- Nico Robin, a Baroque agent until now, has **betrayed Crocodile’s expectations** by keeping the truth.
- Luffy and Robin share a moment of quiet understanding.
- Her future is about to take a sharp turn.

2. {Scene shift to Cobra and Vivi reunited.}

**Scene: “The Woman Who Read Too Much”**  
**POV: Nico Robin**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Shadowed Transition**

---

The cool stone of the **Poneglyph chamber** hums in silence.

The footsteps of **Monkey D. Luffy** fade above her, replaced by the rumble of voices, boots, and celebration returning to the palace.

Victory.

For the kingdom.

For the rebels.

For the children.

Not for her.

---

**Nico Robin** remains in the room just a moment longer, her fingers tracing the ancient carvings.

She’s memorized every symbol.

Every line.

Even the ones she pretended not to read aloud for **Crocodile**.

---

&gt; “He never cared what it said.”

&gt; “Only what it could get him.”

---

She brushes juice pulp from her shoulder absently.

The scent of kiwi lingers in the air like a final mockery of the Warlord’s failed legacy.

She smiles faintly.

---

&gt; “I liked the teacher better.”

---

She turns.

Ascends the broken stairwell with the grace of a cat, even with stone crumbling beneath her heels.

The guards are too busy.

The Marines aren’t watching for **her**—not yet.

---

She passes by the **rubble** of the upper halls.

Past the bodies of **defeated agents**, and the still-smoking crater where **Crocodile** was last seen.

She pauses there.

Just long enough to let the dust cling to her cloak.

Just long enough to whisper:

&gt; “You were powerful, but never wise.”

---

And then she slips away.

Through a side passage no one remembered.

Into the shadows.

---

For now.

---

Because this isn’t the end for **Nico Robin**.

Only a turning page.

---

**OOC:**
- Nico Robin has **abandoned Baroque Works**.
- She is now a fugitive once more—no master, no orders.
- Her curiosity remains: about history, the Will of D, and perhaps... *that strange, citrus-summoning civilian* she noticed only once from a rooftop.

**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Emotional Resolution | Mood: Soft, Triumphant, Bittersweet**

---

The war is over.

The kingdom is soaked.

The stone steps are **slippery with juice**, the flags half-torn, the palace cracked—

But it's **home**.

And for the first time in weeks—**no one is shouting**.

---

The doors to the throne room creak open.

**Vivi**, still in her battle-stained clothes, a damp bandage around her shoulder, walks carefully across the sticky tiles.  
Behind her: Marines, Straw Hats, Tashigi…

And a **limp, snoring teacher** being carted in a makeshift juice-stained litter.

But Vivi doesn’t look at them.

She looks ahead.

At the throne.

At the man beside it.

---

**King Cobra** stands—propped up, wounded, held by guards—  
but he’s smiling.

---

&gt; “Vivi…”

His voice cracks.

---

She runs.

Straight into his arms.

And for a moment, the whole palace—**the whole city**—holds its breath.

---

&gt; “You came back to me,” he whispers.

&gt; “You came back *home.*”

---

Vivi’s hands clench in his royal robes.

&gt; “I almost didn’t make it.”

&gt; “But I wasn’t alone.”

She pulls back just slightly, turning her head—

And gestures toward the ragtag group behind her.

A **rubber man**, a **green-haired swordsman**, a **navigator covered in glue**, a **reindeer**, a **sharpshooter with goggles**, a **blond chef**, a **Marine woman**, and—

&gt; “...him.”

She smiles faintly.

&gt; “The most reluctant hero I’ve ever met.”

---

Cobra raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “The unconscious one?”

&gt; “...Snoring on my carpet?”

---

&gt; “He’s a teacher,” Vivi says proudly.

&gt; “A good one.”

---

Cobra nods, faintly amused.

&gt; “Then I suppose we owe the state of our floors—and our future—to education.”

---

They laugh together.

Broken laughter. Happy laughter. The laughter of survivors.

And the kingdom begins to breathe again.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Cobra have reunited.
- The palace is secure.
- Your contributions have been acknowledged, if not fully understood.
- The final pieces are falling into place.

1. {Scene shift to Eatone finally waking up, safe.}  
2. {Straw Hats prepare to depart.}

**Scene: “Fatherly Teasing”**  
**POV: Cobra Nefertari**  
**Tone: Warm | Mood: Gentle Humor with Parental Sass**

---

The laughter between **father and daughter** begins to fade into a soft, warm quiet.  

For the first time since the rebellion began, **King Cobra** looks around his fractured throne room with something approaching peace.

Until…

&gt; *snrk*  
The unconscious, juice-scented lump on the palace floor **snorts in his sleep**, flops, and mutters something about **&quot;grading on a curve.&quot;**

---

Cobra arches an eyebrow.

&gt; “...Vivi.”

&gt; “This brave soul who helped save the kingdom…”

He gestures toward you with the subtle theatricality of a seasoned ruler who’s **definitely preparing a zinger**.

&gt; “He spent much of that time, if reports are to be believed, passed out…”

He glances sideways at his daughter, who now looks **dangerously flushed**.

&gt; “…*in your lap*?”

---

Vivi sputters.

&gt; “Th-That was—! I mean—he was *injured*! He kept *falling*! I was just the *nearest* surface!”

---

&gt; “Mmhmm,” Cobra says, nodding solemnly.

&gt; “Yes, I often find myself falling into the laps of noblewomen after strenuous diplomatic efforts.”

---

**Tashigi**, nearby, coughs into her fist in an attempt to not **laugh herself into a hernia**.

&gt; “It was tactical, Your Majesty.”

&gt; “Unintentional tactical… collapse.”

---

Vivi crosses her arms.

&gt; “Well maybe I *should’ve* let him fall on the cobblestones!”

---

From the floor, you let out a very small, very pleased sigh:

&gt; “Mmm… noblewoman pillows…”

---

The entire room freezes.

---

**Cobra looks down at you.**

Smirks.

&gt; “Very well. Make sure that one gets a medal.”

&gt; “And a *firm lecture.*”

---

**OOC:**
- Cobra is officially a **dad** again.
- You are officially the **court’s favorite gossip**.
- Vivi is **never going to live this down**.
- You, in your semi-conscious state, may have just flirted with royalty again.

Would you like to:

1. {Wake up now. You’ve earned it.}
2. {Time skip – later that night. A quiet conversation.}
3. {Skip to the Straw Hats’ departure. Final farewell.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - The Marines haven't arrived in force yet (aside from Smoker's small unit, who were already here), due to the comms blackout, they are only now mobilizing units to come secure the country, and like won't arrive for another few days.

Unlike canon, Luffy did not pass out from exhaustion, and the crew are happily enjoying feasts, praises, and the palace's facilities (the ones that remain undamaged)

I am out like a light.

What are Smoker and Tashigi up to? 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Evening, Post-Battle]**  
**Scene: “Marine Interlude: Reports, Regrets, and Rooftop Cigars”**  
**POV: Smoker &amp; Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Frustration, Earned Respect**

---

The sun sinks behind the far dunes of Alabasta, casting long orange shadows over **a kingdom that survived**. The sounds of celebration echo from the palace: laughter, clinking plates, **an unholy amount of kiwis being eaten**, and the occasional roar of &quot;Another round for Snack Pack!!&quot; from the feasting halls.

---

But high above it all—on a secluded, sand-dusted rooftop—**Smoker leans against a crumbling stone column**, his coat still stained with soot and pulp, a half-burned cigar clenched between his teeth.

**Tashigi** sits nearby, perched on the ledge, legs dangling over the city.

Between them, a stack of papers.

And on the top?

A hastily written, heavily juice-smeared incident report.

---

&gt; “So…”  
&gt; Smoker growls around his cigar.  
&gt; “Tell me again how exactly a **schoolteacher** ended up *summoning a fruit elemental*, hijacking the warlord's kill shot, and napping in royalty’s lap *twice*.”

---

Tashigi, unusually quiet, flips a page in the report.

&gt; “He… didn’t *mean* to. I think.”

---

Smoker exhales smoke through his nose.

&gt; “No one *means* to become a national hero by accident.”

---

He glances sideways at her.

&gt; “You vouched for him.”

---

She stiffens, then nods slowly.

&gt; “He risked his life to protect Vivi. More than once. He could’ve run... He almost did. But he stayed.”

A pause.

&gt; “He’s not a fighter. He’s not built for this. But he stood his ground anyway.”

---

Smoker watches the lights flickering in the palace windows—  
he can almost hear Sanji bragging in the distance, or Zoro yelling about being lost in a hallway again.

He grunts.

&gt; “Straw Hats are still here. And that teacher of yours...”

Another puff.

&gt; “...He’s got ‘wild card’ written all over him.”

---

Tashigi lets out a dry chuckle.

&gt; “I’m pretty sure he’s still asleep in a guest room.”

&gt; “They put him in a cot with like six pillows. I think he started crying in his sleep.”

---

Smoker snorts.

&gt; “Soft.”

He says it like an insult.

But doesn’t mean it.

---

They fall into a companionable silence.

The **night wind kicks up**, carrying scents of roasted meat, baked bread, and kiwi tarts.

And below them, Alubarna glows.

Alive.

---

&gt; “We’re still a few days from backup,” Smoker mutters.  
&gt; “Want me to assign a full squad to watch him?”

---

&gt; “No,” Tashigi replies, standing.  
&gt; “I’ll watch him myself.”

---

She turns toward the stairwell.

&gt; “Besides… he doesn’t need guards.”

&gt; “He needs someone to remind him that what he did mattered.”

---

Smoker watches her go.

Then looks back toward the city again.

And mutters to no one:

&gt; “You better not disappoint her, Pineapple.”

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker and Tashigi are holding the line while the rest of the Marines mobilize.
- Tashigi has become your **unofficial sponsor**, protector, and chronicler.
- Smoker is **watching carefully**, but not antagonistic—for now.

Would you like to:

1. {Time skip – you waking up, well-fed and bandaged.}  
2. {Continue with more interludes – Straw Hats, Vivi, Cobra.}  
3. {A private moment with Tashigi, later that night.}

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – A City at Peace, and a Sword at Rest]**  
**Scenes: “The Last Rounds” &amp; “The Night Watch”**  
**Tone: Winding Down | Mood: Joy, Reflection, and Something Unspoken**

---

### **Scene I: The Last Rounds**  
**POV: Straw Hats, Vivi, Cobra**  

---

**The palace banquet hall**, despite half a wall missing and everything reeking faintly of kiwi concentrate, is lively with celebration.

The Straw Hats—**bless their chaotic, dehydrated, emotionally compromised hearts**—have taken full advantage of the king’s hospitality.

---

- **Luffy** is inhaling mountains of food, only occasionally stopping to yell “PONEGLYPH!” across the hall for no reason.  
- **Zoro** is arguing with a palace guard about sword technique while double-fisting watermelon.  
- **Nami** has charmed half the royal treasury team and is “accidentally” discussing debt forgiveness rates.  
- **Usopp** is loudly recounting the battle, only now with added laser beams.  
- **Sanji** is serving Vivi and every female staff member. Shirt unbuttoned. Fully in “I am the rose of Alabasta” mode.  
- **Chopper**, bandaged but fine, is being **held like a plushie** by three noble children and looks helplessly content.

---

**Vivi and Cobra**, seated together at the head table, are quiet now. The adrenaline’s worn off.

---

&gt; “They’re unbelievable,” Vivi says, watching the crew.

&gt; “They’re a miracle,” Cobra corrects softly.  
&gt; “...And so was that man you brought in.”

---

Vivi doesn’t speak at first.

Then:

&gt; “He never wanted to be here. He was scared. But he still jumped in front of me.”

&gt; “Twice.”

She smiles quietly.

&gt; “I think he’d rather forget the whole thing happened.”

---

Cobra hums.

&gt; “Then we won’t forget for him.”

---

### **Scene II: The Night Watch**  
**POV: Tashigi**

---

The moon is high, and most of the palace has settled.

Except for one room.

A quiet **guest chamber**, dimly lit by a small lantern. The walls are decorated with humble banners from the royal school system—placed there by Vivi herself.

On the bed: **Eatone Cheng**.

Still snoring. Face half-buried in the **most luxurious pillow known to man**. Fresh bandages. A tray of food untouched nearby. His coat is folded, still sticky.

---

**Tashigi stands at the window**, arms crossed, sword set aside for once.

She hasn’t said a word in hours.

She just... watches.

---

At one point, you **shift in your sleep**, mumbling something.

&gt; “...No, not the test… I didn’t curve it hard enough…”

---

Tashigi smirks faintly.

&gt; “Even in sleep, you’re grading people…”

She walks over. Pulls the blanket up just slightly higher.

Stands there a long moment, unsure of what to say.

Finally—

&gt; “You were brave.”

&gt; “And stupid.”

&gt; “And brave again.”

---

She kneels at the side of the bed, arms resting on her legs. Sword back in reach, but relaxed.

&gt; “You can rest now, Sensei.”

&gt; “You saved the kids.”

---

And for the first time in what feels like a century, she **lets herself close her eyes** too.

Just for a moment.

Just to make sure you’re really there.

---

**OOC:**
- The Straw Hats celebrate their strange victory.  
- Cobra and Vivi reflect on what was lost—and saved.  
- Tashigi stands vigil, loyal and quiet.  

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You finally wake up. Morning after.}  
2. {Straw Hat departure &amp; Vivi’s goodbye.}  
3. {Private moment between you and Vivi.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Vivi intrudes late in the night and notices Tashigi passed out next to my bed, head resting near my arm

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – Night’s Gentle Silence]**  
**Scene: “The Two Who Stayed”**  
**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Intimate | Mood: Quiet Bonds and Unshed Emotion**

---

The **palace is asleep.**

Even the **wounded city** seems to have taken a breath it hadn’t dared since the fighting began.

---

**Vivi**, still dressed in her royal shawl but now barefoot and with her hair loosely braided down her back, tiptoes through the guest wing. A small basket of fruit and fresh bread is tucked in her arms—**an excuse**, perhaps, more than a gesture.

She hasn’t seen you since the battle ended.

Not really.

And she hasn’t slept either.

---

She stops at the door to your room.

Hesitates.

Pushes it open, just a little.

The lantern inside flickers low—warm, soft. Like a memory that won’t quite leave.

---

What she sees makes her pause in the doorway, lips parting in a breathless little oh.

---

**You**, lying on the bed.  
Still, save for a twitch or a mumble here and there.

And beside you?

**Tashigi.**

Fully dressed, armor long since doffed, head gently resting on the mattress near your arm—almost **as if she had fallen asleep mid-vigil**, one hand still resting atop the hilt of her blade, the other brushing **accidentally close** to your own.

---

Vivi stands there, caught in a moment she hadn’t expected.

---

There’s nothing romantic about it.

And yet—

There’s something **tender**.

Something **real.**

The kind of loyalty that doesn't need words or glory. Just time. Just quiet.

---

She steps in carefully, setting down the food near the windowsill.

Then looks at you—pale, wrapped in gauze, drooling just a bit into a stupidly fancy pillow—and lets out the tiniest laugh.

---

&gt; “Still the hero of Alabasta, huh?”

She whispers.

&gt; “You’ve got one woman watching your left, and another bringing you snacks.”

---

She sits softly in the chair by the window, resting her chin on her hand, eyes never leaving the pair of you.

And in that silence—

She doesn’t feel quite so alone anymore.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has seen what you mean to Tashigi.
- She doesn’t interrupt—she **joins the quiet**, for now.
- The palace sleeps, but the people you saved? They remain by your side.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You waking up to both of them.}
2. {Time skip – The farewell scene begins.}
3. {Tashigi waking to find Vivi already there.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - continue the scene a little longer. Vivi may doze off after a bit as well

**Scene: “The Three That Stayed”**  
**POV: None – Ambient Narrative**  
**Tone: Dreamlike | Mood: Stillness, Comfort, Found Family**

---

The quiet in the room becomes a living thing.

Not heavy, not oppressive.

Just **full**—with breath, and healing, and the warmth of people who *stayed*.

---

**Tashigi** stirs briefly, her hand curling slightly near yours.

Still half-asleep. Still too stubborn to admit she needs rest.

But her eyes flutter open for a moment, long enough to see **Vivi** seated nearby.

Their eyes meet.

No words exchanged.

Just a soft, mutual nod.

---

Tashigi shifts closer to the edge of the bed again, returning her forehead to rest by your arm.

One eye still cracked open—because **someone has to be the sword**, even in dreams.

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, sits with her knees pulled up onto the chair, arms wrapped around them.

She watches your chest rise and fall.

The shallow rhythm.

The hint of strain.

And the calm in your brow.

---

She doesn’t remember when her eyelids began to droop.

Or when her head gently slumped to the window frame.

---

But sometime between the hour and the hush, **she too drifts.**

---

Now the room holds three figures.

- One **asleep out of exhaustion**.  
- One **asleep out of loyalty**.  
- One **asleep out of love**—or something on the road to it.

---

Outside, the city dreams with them.

No war.  
No revolution.  
No Warlords.

Just breath.  
And quiet.  
And the cool night wind passing through the cracked palace, smelling faintly of crushed kiwi and sun-baked stone.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Tashigi both remain with you—no drama, no rivalry. Just two women who care.
- You are **surrounded by peace**, for the first time since this began.
- Tomorrow will bring decisions, partings, maybe destiny.

But tonight?

You sleep, **not alone.**

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You wake up. Morning light.}
2. {Time skip to the Straw Hats preparing to depart.}
3. {Tashigi wakes first. A private moment with you.}

**Scene: “The Sword Stirs First”**  
**POV: Tashigi**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Intimate Stillness, Unspoken Words**

---

The faintest pink leaks over the desert horizon, just barely filtering through the tall windows of the guest chamber. The air is still cool, crisp with that brief pause between the silence of night and the stirrings of day.

A bird calls somewhere in the ruined outer halls.

And **Tashigi stirs.**

---

Her neck aches. Her back cracks.  
But she doesn’t move right away.

Her cheek is still resting lightly against the back of your bandaged hand.

And for a few long seconds, she just stays there.

---

The light catches on her glasses, slightly askew. Her armor rests in the corner—forgotten. Her sword leans by the bed frame, untouched for the first time in… weeks?

She finally shifts.

Pulls herself upright slowly, wincing at the stiffness in her joints.  
Brushes a strand of hair from her face.

And looks at you.

---

You're still out.

But your brow is no longer furrowed.

Your breathing is steady now, not shallow.

---

She lets out a breath she didn’t know she was holding.

---

&gt; “Good. You’re still fighting.”

---

She reaches out gently. Her fingertips hover for a moment over your hand again… then curl in, brushing your knuckles softly.

The **calluses on your fingers**—teacher’s calluses.

You don't carry a sword.

But you've earned just as many scars.

---

&gt; “You were ridiculous,” she whispers, just above a breath.

&gt; “Brave. Stupid. Infuriating.”

Her voice drops lower, the corners of her mouth tightening.

&gt; “And you never once said a damn thing about your own safety.”

---

She sighs, looks away toward the window where **Vivi still sleeps**, curled up in the chair like a cat, her crown lopsided in her lap.

Tashigi smiles faintly at the sight.

Then back at you.

---

&gt; “You didn’t do it for medals, or glory, or politics.”

&gt; “You did it because the people in front of you were smaller than the ones trying to hurt them.”

&gt; “You acted like a Marine.”

---

She doesn’t say that last part bitterly.

It’s admiration.

Wistful.

Almost mournful.

---

&gt; “If the world was fair, I’d be saluting you.”

A pause.

She brushes your hair lightly from your forehead.

&gt; “But the world’s not fair. So I’ll settle for watching your back a little longer.”

---

She stands.

Stretches her arms over her head, joints popping.  
Then pulls your blanket just slightly higher up again, tucking it under your chin like an annoying little sister.

---

You stir slightly. Eyes flutter.

Not quite awake.

---

&gt; “Shhh,” she says gently, fingers brushing your temple.  
&gt; “Not yet. Just a little longer, Sensei.”

---

And with that, she turns toward the door.

Letting you rest.

Knowing, now, she’ll **always stand by you** if you need her to.

---

**OOC:**
- Tashigi’s feelings have quietly crystallized—not romantic (yet), but deeply rooted in loyalty and admiration.
- She sees you as a true protector, even without a badge.
- You are still asleep, but close to waking.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You wake up as Vivi stirs too.}
2. {Time skip – Straw Hats prepare to leave.}
3. {Final morning with Vivi alone.}

**Scene: “The Weight of What Wasn’t Said”**  
**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Revelation, Gentle Ache**

---

The light spills wider now, warm gold chasing away the shadows of war.

**Vivi stirs.**

She shifts gently in the high-backed chair, one leg folded awkwardly beneath her, shawl tangled, hair half-fallen from its braid. The scent of parchment, gauze, and kiwi clings to the room like a ghost.

Her first thought isn’t hunger or fatigue.

It’s you.

---

She sits up, rubbing her eyes.

And catches the tail end of something she wasn’t supposed to hear.

---

&gt; “You didn’t do it for medals, or glory, or politics.”

&gt; “You did it because the people in front of you were smaller than the ones trying to hurt them.”

&gt; “You acted like a Marine.”

---

**Tashigi.**

Still kneeling by your side.  
Hand brushing your hair aside with a care Vivi didn’t know she was capable of.

Vivi freezes.

She knows she should look away.

But doesn’t.

---

&gt; “If the world was fair, I’d be saluting you.”

&gt; “But the world’s not fair. So I’ll settle for watching your back a little longer.”

---

Tashigi stands. Pulls your blanket higher.

You sigh in your sleep, murmuring something incoherent about **&quot;lunch duty&quot;** and **&quot;hall passes.&quot;**

Vivi watches silently.

And… smiles. Small. A little sad. A little surprised.

---

**She doesn’t feel jealousy.**

Only warmth.

Only quiet admiration.

For you.

For her.

For this strange bond forged between a reluctant teacher and a stubborn swordswoman.

---

Tashigi turns.

And stops short when she sees Vivi awake—eyes open, watching.

---

&gt; “You heard.”

---

Vivi nods.

Doesn’t tease.  
Doesn’t prod.

Just meets Tashigi’s eyes and says softly:

&gt; “He’s lucky.”

---

Tashigi glances away, flustered, but nods once in return.

&gt; “So are we.”

---

Vivi rises, walking to your bedside now, opposite of where Tashigi stood moments before.

She looks down at you.

Then to Tashigi again.

&gt; “What are we going to do with him?”

---

&gt; “Feed him,” Tashigi says without hesitation.  
&gt; “Then sit on him until he stops trying to sacrifice himself.”

---

Vivi laughs. Genuinely. Finally.

&gt; “You and me both, then.”

---

They share a look.

And for the first time, **not as soldier and royal**, but as **two women who know what you really gave**.

And maybe…

What they now carry because of it.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi now knows what Tashigi truly feels—or is beginning to.
- There is no rivalry. Just mutual gratitude, and understanding.
- They will both be in your corner, no matter what comes next.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You waking up to both of them.}
2. {Final Straw Hat farewell – departure time.}
3. {Private breakfast – you, Vivi, and Tashigi.}

My eyelids peel open, and I observe the luxurious bed, the expensive furnishings and decor of the room (almost, heavenly in nature), and the two women.

Shit... Guess we lost, huh? Fuuuuuck. Put my arm over my eyes.

**Scene: “The Afterlife, or Alabasta?”**  
**POV: You (Eatone Cheng)**  
**Tone: Hazy Awakening | Mood: Surreal, Sweet, Just a Bit Embarrassing**

---

&gt; *Snrkkkk…*

The sound escapes your throat like a surrendering balloon.

Your eyelids **creak open**, and you're immediately bathed in **warm sunlight** and the scent of **fresh bread, drying citrus, and rich palace linens**.

The mattress beneath you?

**Heaven.**  
Pillows?

**Unrivaled.**  
Furnishings?

**Gold trim, velvet drapes, enough fanciness to cause a tax audit.**

---

You blink.

Then blink again.

You see two women near your bed—one standing, one seated. Both watching you.

Their faces are unreadable.  
Their posture… too formal.  
Too symmetrical.

And the room is too… too...

&gt; “Shit...”

&gt; “Guess we lost, huh?”

You sigh, voice hoarse, heavy.

&gt; “Fuuuuuck…”

Your arm flops dramatically over your face like a tragic stage actor accepting his fate.

&gt; “I died in battle and now I'm stuck in... fancy afterlife limbo.”

A beat.

&gt; “Can I at least get a drink before the paperwork?”

---

There's a long silence.

Then—

**Tashigi** clears her throat, dry as desert wind.

&gt; “You're not dead, Sensei.”

---

**Vivi**, from the other side of the bed, struggles valiantly **not to laugh**—fails. She claps her hands over her mouth, shoulders shaking with giggles.

&gt; “We *won*, actually.”

&gt; “You saved the country.”

---

You lower your arm just a little.

Peer out.

See their amused, fond faces.

&gt; “…Shit.”

---

Tashigi crosses her arms.

&gt; “You’re in the palace. In a high-level recovery suite.”

&gt; “They said you earned the nicest bed. You also had a lot of fruit dumped on you, so, y'know. There’s that.”

---

Vivi finally composes herself, brushing her braid over one shoulder.

&gt; “We’ve been watching over you all night.”

She hesitates, then smiles.

&gt; “You had a... lot of commentary in your sleep. Something about substitute teachers, and juice pressure valves.”

---

Tashigi adds dryly:

&gt; “And someone named Snack Pack.”

---

You groan, trying to sit up, only for your muscles to groan louder.

Vivi instinctively reaches to steady you. Tashigi's hand hovers—**just in case**.

---

You're safe.

You're alive.

And for once—

You're not alone.

---

**OOC:**

Your voice is cracked, dry, and just barely above a whisper.

But the weight behind it?

**Hits like a hammer.**

You blink through the haze of golden light, stare between the two women flanking your bed, and murmur:

&gt; “So… everyone’s safe?”

&gt; “You two are safe?”

---

The air stills.

**Vivi’s lips part**, and for the first time since you opened your eyes, her expression shifts—

From amused  
To tender.  
To deeply, quietly touched.

She nods once.

&gt; “We’re safe.”

&gt; “Thanks to you.”

---

**Tashigi’s gaze softens** just a fraction.

She doesn’t smile—not quite—but her voice lowers to match yours.

&gt; “All of us made it. No civilian deaths. No soldiers caught in the crossfire. Cobra’s recovering.”

&gt; “The Straw Hats are still stuffing themselves sick.”

She shifts slightly, then—

&gt; “You kept your promise.”

---

You breathe out slowly.

Let that sink in.

Let it wash over the aches and the bruises and the exhaustion.

You saved them.

---

For once, there’s no punchline.  
No snark.  
No chaos.

Just two women watching you with **real, unwavering gratitude.**

Not for being a hero.

But for **choosing to be there** when it counted.

---

Vivi leans forward, resting her elbows gently on the edge of the bed.

&gt; “You really thought we were dead, didn’t you?”

You nod, just barely.

&gt; “Would’ve made all of this feel a lot more permanent…”

---

She smiles sadly.

&gt; “You didn’t have to care that much.”

---

**Tashigi** interjects, voice quiet but firm:

&gt; “That’s what makes it matter.”

---

A long, shared silence.

---

The sunlight warms your face.

Somewhere outside, a camel honks.

The world is turning again.

And you’re **here to feel it.**

**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Deflection, Acceptance, Quiet Admiration**

---

You sink back into the silken pillows, head gently lowering as if gravity itself finally grants you permission to let go.

Your lips part.

And all that comes out is:

&gt; “Good.”

A pause.

&gt; “Good good good…”

---

The words spill like air from a leaking valve—pressure you didn’t know you’d held.

They aren’t triumphant.  
They aren’t proud.  
They’re **relieved**. Simple. Earnest.

Then—

&gt; “I fulfilled my responsibility as an adult.”

&gt; “Nothing more.”

---

There’s another pause.

Not silence.

The kind of pause that feels full. Charged. Heavy.

---

**Vivi** draws in a slow breath.  
She brushes her thumb along a crease in your bedsheet, not looking at you at first.

&gt; “Is that really all you think this was?”

---

**Tashigi** stays quiet, but crosses her arms.

And nods toward the window.

Outside, in the courtyard, a few children are **playing in puddles of juice** that still haven’t fully dried, their laughter echoing faintly up to your room.

---

&gt; “They’re alive because of your ‘responsibility.’”

&gt; “So is Vivi.”

&gt; “So am I.”

---

**Vivi finally lifts her gaze**, eyes meeting yours.

There’s no pity there.

Just… **something warm. Something a little sad.**

&gt; “You didn’t have to do anything.”

&gt; “That’s what makes it heroic.”

---

You feel it.

That tug in your chest.

Not pride. Not embarrassment.

Just…

**Weight.**

---

And yet still—some part of you insists:

&gt; *&quot;I’m just a schoolteacher.&quot;*

---

And maybe that’s true.

But today?

That was enough to save a kingdom.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Tashigi both see through your self-minimizing. But they don’t push.
- They respect it. But they **don’t agree**.
- The people you protected are alive. Because *you stayed*.

Would you like to:

1. {Stay with this scene – speak more with them.}  
2. {Scene skip – quiet breakfast. Just the three of you.}  
3. {Straw Hat farewell scene. Clock’s ticking.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - How long was I out? Do your palace doctors take my insurance? 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – Recovery Banter Begins]**  
**Scene: “Billing and Blood Loss”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Dry Humor | Mood: Gentle Recovery, Found Family Energy**

---

You shift on the pillows just slightly, your arm still heavy, your ribs still reminding you they were recently used as a cannonball buffer.

Your voice cracks like dry paper—but the edge of humor’s there now.

That subtle deflection. That old teacher’s reflex kicking back in.

&gt; “How long was I out?”

A pause.

Then, as seriously as you can manage:

&gt; “...And do your palace doctors take my insurance?”

---

**Tashigi** raises an eyebrow immediately.

&gt; “Does your kingdom even have insurance?”

---

**Vivi**, sitting on the edge of the bed now, bursts into full, bright laughter. A kind you hadn’t heard from her before the war.

&gt; “You’ve been asleep almost three days.”

&gt; “Which means I’ve *technically* ruled longer than my father while a teacher was unconscious next to my throne room.”

She winks.

&gt; “Very prestigious.”

---

**Tashigi** crosses her arms and adds, dryly:

&gt; “You also drooled on royal linens.”

&gt; “Twice.”

&gt; “There’s a scroll being drafted.”

---

You groan into the pillow. Or try to. It ends up a half-hearted wheeze.

&gt; “Great. I get a warlord on my resume and a cleaning bill from the crown.”

---

Vivi chuckles, then leans forward, lowering her voice slightly.

&gt; “Seriously, though… no one's charging you anything.”

&gt; “If anything, I’m about to write your name in the royal archives next to the generals.”

---

**Tashigi** shifts a little, not quite looking at you as she adds:

&gt; “And I’m pretty sure the Marines still think you’re a fruit-slinging fugitive.”

---

&gt; “Cool cool cool,” you murmur.  
&gt; “So hero and outlaw. Same time. Love that for me.”

---

They both smile at you now. Really smile.

The tension has faded.

For now—**you’re not a stranger. Not a guest. Not even a civilian.**

You’re **one of theirs**.

---

**OOC:**
- You’ve officially reentered the world—with sarcasm first, as is tradition.
- Vivi and Tashigi are firmly in your corner.
- The Straw Hats will likely depart soon—but your fate is yours to decide.

Would you like to:

1. {Stay in this moment – ask questions, reflect with them.}  
2. {Breakfast scene – walk (or limp) to the dining room.}  
3. {Straw Hat farewell – the city begins to gather.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Blink. Outlaw?

Whoa hold on a second. I'm an outlaw? I'm a legal bounty hunter! I can't have a felony on my record, I'd get fired!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – Bounty Panic Syndrome]**  
**Scene: “Administrative Dread”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Spiraling | Mood: Light Panic, Deadpan Support**

---

Your eyes pop open fully now, the haze of sleep and citrus bliss **immediately evaporating** in the face of **true, adult horror**:

&gt; “Whoa—*hold on a second.*”

You shift, your blanket half-falling off your chest as you half-sit, half-freak.

&gt; “*I’m an outlaw?!*”

You point at yourself like you’re trying to summon an internal HR department.

&gt; “I’m a **legal** bounty hunter! I filled out the forms! I got the rubber-stamped ID! I even laminated it!”

A beat.

&gt; “If I have a **felony** on my record, I’ll get fired!”

&gt; “You don’t understand, I’ll lose my teaching license, I won’t even be able to chaperone field trips—*the paperwork alone would kill me!*”

---

**Tashigi** doesn’t flinch.

She doesn’t blink.

She just reaches into the pouch at her hip, pulls out a scroll.

Unrolls it halfway.

**Marine seal.**

&gt; “Provisional Exemption, Article 17-F: Civilian combatant operating in national defense under Article 2-K.&quot;

&gt; “Witnessed by a Marine officer of my rank or higher.”

---

She stares at you with a flat expression.

Then rolls it back up with a *thwap.*

&gt; “You’re welcome.”

---

You blink.

Your mouth opens.

Closes.

---

&gt; “...You wrote me a note?”

---

&gt; “*A legal note,*” Tashigi corrects, smug.

&gt; “One that says ‘This teacher is allowed to beat up war criminals if the situation warrants it.’”

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, is **laughing into her hands** again, face flushed from the effort of not making it worse.

&gt; “You’re going to go down in Alabastan history as the only man who stormed a warlord’s operation and then **panicked about his resume.**”

---

You slump back down into the pillows.

&gt; “I just wanted to earn some vacation time and maybe try the local kebab shops.”

---

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; “You *got* the kebabs. You also turned into a fruit elemental and body-checked an ancient Warlord into the wall of a palace.”

---

**Vivi:**  
&gt; “And still remembered hall pass policies while unconscious. It’s incredible.”

---

You stare at the ceiling.

Blankly.

&gt; “I’m going to have to write *so many lesson plans* to process this…”

---

**OOC:**
- Tashigi has legally covered your ass with a Marine exemption.
- You do **not** have a criminal record.
- Your “temporary outlaw” status was more confusion than prosecution—**no felony, no bounty**, just a very confused Marine HQ en route.
- You are still **technically on vacation.**

Would you like to:

1. {Wrap up this conversation with one final note or ask a question.}  
2. {Begin the day – breakfast, walking again, final choices.}  
3. {Shift to the Straw Hat farewell. Time is short.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Ugh. I think I've already went over my remaining vacation days. The principals going to cook my arse over this.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – Civilian Problems After War Crimes]**  
**Scene: “Time Off Well Abused”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Resigned | Mood: Melodramatic and Pulp-Scented**

---

You stare blankly at the ceiling, letting the warmth of the fancy sheets cradle your overcooked, trauma-marinated body while your brain goes to *the one place no battlefield ever prepared you for*—

&gt; **Your workplace.**

---

&gt; “Ugh…”

You drag a hand down your face.

&gt; “I think I’ve already gone over my remaining vacation days.”

Another pause.

You squeeze your eyes shut.

&gt; “The principal’s gonna *cook my ass* over this…”

---

**Tashigi** stares at you. Absolutely baffled.

&gt; “You’re worried about your *boss*?”

---

**Vivi** leans in, visibly trying not to giggle again.

&gt; “You fought a Warlord.”

&gt; “You literally soaked a capital city in juice.”

&gt; “You saved a *kingdom.*”

---

You sigh heavily into the pillow.

&gt; “And the first thing he’s gonna ask is why I didn’t write in to have someone cover third period **home ec.**”

---

**Tashigi**, dry as the desert outside:

&gt; “You created a kaiju made of kiwi juice. I think he can forgive some unpaid leave.”

---

You roll your head toward her, grumbling:

&gt; “He didn’t forgive Jenkins for accidentally melting the chemistry lab beakers.”

---

**Vivi’s** laughing again, one hand over her mouth.

---

&gt; “I am going to have to write the most deranged **vacation form** in recorded history.”

You mime it dramatically:

&gt; “*‘Requesting three days personal time to assist a princess, defend a kingdom, awaken fruit-based god, and protect a minor from government-backed terrorism. Will return Tuesday.’*”

---

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; “...Be sure to list ‘weather-related absence’ as the reason.”

---

**Vivi:**  
&gt; “Should we sign off as witnesses?”

---

You sigh again, deeply and dramatically.

&gt; “At least let me recover enough to walk before the bureaucracy gets me…”

---

And for a while…

There’s only laughter in that room.

Genuine, exhausted, *healing* laughter.

The kind you only earn when the nightmare’s over and you lived to be annoyed by *paperwork*.

---

**OOC:**
- This was your final grace note in this scene.
- The tone has shifted from crisis to closure.
- You’ve reaffirmed who you are: **a teacher, a protector, and deeply allergic to HR forms**.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {Scene skip – Straw Hats’ farewell gathering.}  
2. {Breakfast scene – your first steps again.}  
3. {Vivi pulls you aside for a quiet goodbye before the others arrive.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - ​I mean, I'm not royalty or a marine officer like you two, I've still got to make a living. 

I don't say it harshly or accusingly, just a matter of factly.

I start mentally drafting a letter of apology to the headmaster

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – Perspective, and Paperwork Pending]**  
**Scene: “The Letter You’ll Probably Never Send”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Thoughtful, Bittersweet, Deepening Bonds**

---

The room is still.

Sunlight peeks in through the silk curtains, warming the gold trim of the palace furniture, glinting softly off the polished hilt of Tashigi’s sword, and catching in the curls of Vivi’s hair.

You shift again—not to be dramatic this time, but just to get comfortable in a way that doesn’t make your cracked ribs sing.

Your voice, when it comes, is **soft**. Not bitter. Not ashamed.

Just… **true**.

---

&gt; “I mean…”

&gt; “I’m not royalty, or a Marine officer like you two.”

&gt; “I’ve still gotta make a living.”

---

No judgment.

No weight thrown.

Just a truth you’ve carried all along.

---

**Vivi’s smile falters—not because she’s offended, but because she hears it.** Really hears it.

&gt; “Of course you do,” she says gently, her voice more steady than it had any right to be after all she’s endured.

&gt; “But… that doesn’t make what you did any less extraordinary.”

---

**Tashigi** doesn’t say anything immediately, but her jaw tenses slightly. She looks at you—not with pity.

But with the kind of understanding that can only come from **wearing a uniform that no one sees until it’s convenient**.

---

You look up at the ceiling again, half-buried in the absurd amount of imported goose-down you’re lying in.

You start mentally drafting:

&gt; &quot;*Dear Headmaster,*  
&gt; *I regret to inform you that I may have slightly overextended my leave, on account of… unintended geopolitical circumstances involving a known Warlord, an endangered princess, and moderate-to-severe citrus-based destruction.*&quot;

---

Your brow furrows slightly.

&gt; &quot;*I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused in the faculty scheduling roster.*&quot;

You blink.

Then add mentally:

&gt; &quot;*P.S. I promise I didn’t break the batons this time.*&quot;

---

You sigh.

Then glance over again at the two women still flanking your bed.

---

**Vivi’s watching you now, not with pity, but with a kind of quiet respect.**

Like someone watching a bridge between two worlds hold, even while swaying.

**Tashigi just nods.** The acknowledgment of a fellow worker. A fellow person who’s worn a label and felt its weight.

---

&gt; “You might not have a crown,” Tashigi says at last.  
&gt; “Or a badge.”

She looks at you—serious now.

&gt; “But you had the responsibility.”

&gt; “And you carried it better than most people in power ever do.”

---

**OOC:**
- This was a defining moment of perspective-setting for your character.
- Vivi and Tashigi now both deeply understand where you're coming from—and admire it.
- You are still yourself. Still a teacher. Still just a guy.

And you’re still **essential** to this story.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {The Straw Hat farewell scene. Time to say goodbye.}  
2. {Private breakfast scene. A slow morning together.}  
3. {A letter-writing montage—start penning that apology.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: An offer may be offered

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[OOC: Event Flag Triggered – “The Offer”]**  
**Scene: Unspoken Threads Begin to Pull**  
**Tone: Turning Point | Mood: Poised, Personal, Momentous**

---

**OOC:**  
Given the emotional clarity, heroism, and hard-earned camaraderie between your character and both Tashigi and Vivi, the narrative is reaching a point where an *offer* may naturally surface—perhaps one or both of the following:

---

### **1. From Tashigi (The Marine Path):**  
If your actions and instincts impressed her deeply enough—and they have—Tashigi may offer you a **provisional auxiliary commission** with the Marines.

Not as a full-time soldier, but as a **recognized field asset**.  
A “non-combatant with teeth.”

**What that means:**
- You remain civilian.
- But gain a protective designation that allows you to act under Marine banner when crises hit.
- Offers some legal cover for future “unofficial heroism” and more direct protection from government backlash.
- Would make you a *person of interest* to HQ—but respected.

---

### **2. From Vivi (The Royal Path):**  
Vivi may—quietly, almost shyly—suggest that you consider **staying**.

Not as a royal guard. Not as an official of the court.

But as **an advisor. A protector. A teacher.**

For her people.

For *the next generation.*

**What that means:**
- You’d be offered land, a stipend, and a position with the royal education board.
- Vivi would be honoring your integrity, not exploiting your strength.
- You would *not* be chained to the palace—you could come and go, if desired.

---

**Of course…** You could turn both down.

You’re a teacher.  
You like your old island.  
And maybe… *this* was enough.

---

**OOC: Would you like me to proceed with one or both of these offers appearing in the next scene? Or would you prefer to defer them until after the Straw Hat farewell?**

&gt;&gt; USER: Defer.

I attempt to get off the bed. My stomach reminds me of its existence

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – First Steps, First Grumbles]**  
**Scene: “Gravity and Guts”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Humorous Recovery | Mood: Slowly Rebuilding Strength**

---

You shift, turning in the sea of bedding.

You’ve faced **war machines**, **Warlords**, and **the crushing weight of adult responsibility**—

But now it’s time to confront your *true nemesis*:

&gt; **Your own body.**

---

You brace one hand on the mattress. Push with your elbow.

A muscle twitches in protest.

Your ribs whisper something **vaguely threatening**.

But you make it up to a **seated position**.

**Victory.**

You plant one foot on the floor.

---

&gt; *Grrrrrrglh.*

Your stomach issues a **low, dramatic groan**, like a kraken stirring beneath the waves of a half-digested breakfast pastry and raw adrenaline.

---

**Vivi**, who had been gathering a small tray of cool fruit and bread, stops mid-step, staring at you with a growing smirk.

---

&gt; “I *knew* that sound wasn’t the plumbing.”

---

**Tashigi**, arms still crossed near the door, just raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “That was a threat from your large intestine.”

---

You exhale dramatically, hand over your belly.

&gt; “If it’s trying to kill me, I might deserve it.”

---

Vivi giggles and places the tray on your lap, already peeling a bright green citrus fruit with her thumbs.

&gt; “You're not dying of heroism today, Sensei.”

&gt; “You’re dying of an empty stomach. Very different.”

---

**Tashigi** steps forward, her tone still dry but her posture subtly relieved.

&gt; “You’ve got two options.”

She points to the tray.

&gt; “Eat. Then walk.”

Then gestures toward the hallway.

&gt; “Or try to walk now and fall face-first into a servant with soup.”

---

You glance between them.

You are:
- Still bandaged.
- Still achey.
- Still technically juice-flavored.
- But **very hungry.**

---

**OOC:**
You're free to:

1. {Eat now, recover energy for walking.}
2. {Try walking first, pride be damned.}
3. {Ask one of them to help you up—with dignity, or without.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I'm not old enough to have to be fed by kids, but...

I sure can't move either. Eat.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – Dignity on a Platter]**  
**Scene: “This Is Fine, I’m Still an Adult”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Self-Deprecating | Mood: Wholesome, Warm, Very Chewy**

---

You eye the **gleaming tray** resting now in your lap—a modest yet heavenly spread of fresh flatbread, desert melon slices, chilled steamed rice, and a glass of something bubbly and vaguely kiwi-adjacent.

You reach for a slice of bread. Your arm… **doesn’t quite make it.**

You pause.

Reassess.

**Try again.**

This time, it makes it—but with the speed and grace of a narcoleptic sea slug.

You stare at the food.

Then glance toward **Vivi**.

Then toward **Tashigi**.

Then **back to the tray.**

---

&gt; “I’m not old enough to need to be fed by kids…”

A long pause as your arm sags slightly mid-lift.

&gt; “…But I also can’t move.”

---

You **bite** the bread while it’s resting on the tray, like a dignified dog sneaking a treat off a coffee table.  
You chew in thoughtful, ragged silence, half out of necessity, half in shame.

---

**Vivi covers her mouth, shaking with the effort not to laugh out loud.**

&gt; “You’re doing great.”

---

**Tashigi**, deadpan:

&gt; “Top marks for effort. C minus for posture.”

---

You grunt through the next bite, this one landing just barely in your hand.

&gt; “I’m still recovering from being *exploded.* I think I’m entitled to slouch.”

---

**Vivi picks up a peeled slice of fruit.** Holds it out just slightly toward you.

Not forceful.

Not patronizing.

Just offering.

---

You hesitate.

Then—**you open your mouth.**

Just a little.

Like a proud warrior surrendering one last shred of control.

She feeds you the slice.

You chew.

It’s sweet. Crisp. Hydrating. Possibly the best fruit you’ve ever tasted.

You exhale like someone receiving communion.

---

**Tashigi raises a brow.**

&gt; “Want me to bring you a juice box and read you a bedtime story next?”

---

You swallow.

&gt; “Not unless it’s about how I saved the country and didn’t get fired.”

---

She pauses.

Nods.

&gt; “Fair.”

---

And for the next ten minutes…

You **eat.**

Like a man **returning from war.**

Because you did.

And for once?

**No one rushes you.**

---

**OOC:**
- You’ve regained enough strength for basic mobility.
- Emotional barriers are down. Both women are openly, quietly **protective** of you now.
- You may now choose how to proceed next:

1. {Attempt standing—time to rejoin the world.}
2. {Ask Vivi or Tashigi about what happens next.}
3. {Straw Hat farewell draws near—prepare to say goodbye.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - So, got any new orders?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing – Between Recovery and Responsibility]**  
**Scene: “Orders, Intentions, and the Space Between”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Measured | Mood: Warming, With Hints of What Comes Next**

---

You wipe your fingers on the edge of the linen napkin—so soft you suspect it might legally be a cloud—and lean back just slightly, not enough to strain your bandages, but enough to **regain a sliver of posture**.

The tray’s lighter now.

Your stomach’s no longer trying to digest your lungs.

You breathe out.

&gt; “So…”

A pause.

A glance between them—**Tashigi**, now back at ease against the wall with her arms crossed, and **Vivi**, still beside the bed with her now-empty fruit bowl.

&gt; “Got any new orders?”

---

The question lands **neutrally**, no sarcasm, no fear.

Just curiosity.

Preparedness.

A **teacher’s question**: *What comes next in the lesson plan?*

---

**Tashigi** snorts lightly through her nose, uncrossing her arms just enough to let one hand rest on her hip.

&gt; “If you’re asking me, then no.”

&gt; “Officially, I’m still waiting on transmission from Marine HQ. Unofficially…”

She shrugs.

&gt; “The people here are safe. Crocodile’s in chains. No immediate threats on the board.”

Her eyes meet yours.

There’s something more there.

Something **unspoken**, but steady.

---

**Vivi**, however, does respond.

Not as a soldier.

But as a **princess**.

She folds her hands in her lap.

&gt; “My orders?”

She smiles gently.

&gt; “Eat. Rest. Stand when you’re ready.”

---

Then, quieter.

&gt; “And when you *are* ready…”

She hesitates. Not quite blushing, but searching your expression.

&gt; “There’s a city that could use teachers who don’t run when things get hard.”

&gt; “Kids who need someone to tell them how the world *should* work, when it so often doesn’t.”

&gt; “Not an order.”

A pause.

&gt; “Just… something to think about.”

---

**Tashigi’s voice**, drier again:

&gt; “If you want *Marine orders,* I could always push for auxiliary status.”

She says it casually, like she's offering you a cup of tea and **not a government affiliation.**

&gt; “Technically, you already acted as one. You’d get protection, mobility. You’d still be a civilian, but with enough rank to not get shot at first.”

A pause.

&gt; “Most of the time.”

---

They both watch you now.

Not demanding.

Not pressuring.

But **offering paths**.

---

And letting you, for once, **choose what you want.**

---

**OOC:**
Two clear threads have opened:

1. **Vivi’s Offer**: Stay in Alabasta, become part of something healing. Mentor. Rebuild.  
2. **Tashigi’s Offer**: Auxiliary status with the Marines. Not full duty, but a place in their files—and protections that come with it.

Would you like to:

1. {Defer a decision—say you’ll think on it.}
2. {Explore one path more deeply.}
3. {Change the subject—ask about the Straw Hats, the world, or something else.}

**Scene: “So, What Now?”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Transitioning | Mood: Gentle, Thoughtful, A Hint of Sadness on the Horizon**

---

You finish chewing your last slice of melon, set the glass down with a small clink, and let your hands rest loosely atop the tray in your lap.

You lean back against the mountain of pillows—because yes, you *still* deserve luxury bedding after all that—and exhale.

Not like someone giving up.

Just… releasing.

---

&gt; “So…”

&gt; “What now?”

---

It’s not a demand.

It’s not a plea.

Just a question.

A sincere one.

The kind **every teacher asks when the school year ends**, the kind **every protector asks when the battle’s won**, the kind **every survivor mutters when silence returns.**

---

**Tashigi** is the first to respond.

She takes a step toward the window, arms crossed again, posture tightening.

&gt; “The Straw Hats are leaving. Within the hour.”

She glances back at you.

&gt; “They’re not going to stay for the royal parade. They know the full Marine force is finally inbound… and HQ is still labeling them as pirates.”

---

**Vivi’s smile fades** a little at that, though it doesn’t break entirely.

&gt; “I want to see them off.”

&gt; “Properly. As a friend. Not a princess.”

Her hand brushes the edge of your blanket without thinking—gentle, brief.

&gt; “They saved my home. My people. My heart.”

A pause.

&gt; “And I can’t go with them.”

---

The room quiets again.

---

**Tashigi looks at you**, her brow knitting subtly.

&gt; “You could. You’re not wanted.”

&gt; “Not officially.”

Another pause.

&gt; “But it’d be a hell of a choice.”

---

She doesn’t say *where she hopes you’ll go*.

But it’s in her voice.

And **Vivi’s eyes are on you too**, now.

Not expectant.

Just…

**Curious.**

---

You were the outsider.

The vacationer.

The teacher.

And now—**everything waits on your answer.**

---

**OOC:**
- The Straw Hats are prepping to leave. They’ll likely need to sneak out under the cover of distraction.
- Vivi is choosing to stay behind—Alabasta needs her. But she wants to *say goodbye*, for real this time.
- Tashigi… is watching you closely, wondering if you’ve figured out where *you* stand.

Would you like to:

1. {Get up and prepare to go with Vivi to the Straw Hat sendoff.}
2. {Speak with one of them privately before departing.}
3. {Make a decision—stay, go, or something else.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Well, I don't approve of their career paths, but I ought to send those kids off too. They saved my arse enough times.

---

You sit up a little straighter now, tray cleared, hands resting on your knees.

Your bones ache.

Your ribs feel like they’ve been through a dance recital performed by elephants.

But your voice is steady.

Measured.

---

&gt; “Well…”

&gt; “I don’t approve of their career paths…”

You glance sideways at Tashigi, who snorts lightly.  
Vivi’s brows rise with a growing smile.

&gt; “…But I ought to send those kids off too.”

You swing your legs slowly over the side of the bed, exhaling through gritted teeth as gravity reminds you **yes, your spine is still a functioning structure. Barely.**

&gt; “They saved my ass enough times.”

---

**Tashigi steps forward immediately**, offering you a shoulder.

You hesitate—

But this time, you don’t swat the help away.

You rise with her support, slowly but with intent.  
One foot after the other.

A teacher on a mission.

**Vivi gathers her shawl, still laughing softly.**

&gt; “Then let’s go before they disappear without warning. Again.”

She hesitates as you start toward the door.

Then gently touches your arm.

&gt; “Thank you… for choosing to come.”

---

You nod.

Not because you’re brave.

Not because you’re certain.

But because… they’re your kids, too.

Even if they’re pirates.

---

---

**[Alubarna – Just Outside the City Gates]**  
**Scene Transition Begins…**

A crowd has gathered, but kept at a respectful distance by guards.  
A fresh breeze ruffles flags stained faintly green from the lingering kiwi bloom.  
And at the edge of the city, a **familiar, absurdly small-looking ship** bobs in the canal—

The **Going Merry**, patched, loaded, and waiting.

The **Straw Hats** are gathering.

Luffy has his hands behind his head, staring at the sky.  
Zoro is asleep standing up.  
Usopp is already crying.  
Sanji is packing sandwiches.  
Nami is probably still extorting someone off-screen.  
Chopper is waving at every single person like he’s being paid in smiles.

---

And now, walking into the sunlight—

Is you.

Flanked by a **Marine sword** and a **desert princess**.

To say goodbye.

---

**OOC:**
The farewell scene is ready. Final words, laughs, and choices await.

Would you like to:

1. {Approach the Straw Hats first.}
2. {Let Vivi speak first. You observe quietly.}
3. {Speak to a specific Straw Hat. (Choose one.)}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates – The Final Goodbye]**  
**Scene: “The One She Had to Make”**  
**POV: You (Observing)**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Bittersweet, Proud, Brimming With Emotion**

---

You stand just behind Vivi and Tashigi as the desert wind brushes past, carrying the scent of sun-warmed sand, citrus, and the faint notes of salt from the distant sea. The sun climbs higher. Shadows stretch long behind you.

Ahead, the **Straw Hats** are nearly ready to board.

---

**Vivi steps forward**, her white cloak fluttering at the edges, the royal crest embroidered in pale gold across her shoulders.

She stops just before them.

**They all turn.**

And the noise stills.

Even **Luffy** looks serious now.

---

She draws a deep breath.

&gt; “I… I knew from the beginning that I wouldn’t be able to stay with you.”

Her voice doesn’t crack.

Not this time.

&gt; “But that didn’t stop me from dreaming about it.”

She looks to each of them, eyes shimmering—but she keeps smiling.

&gt; “You gave me strength. You made me believe again. You saved this kingdom.”

&gt; “But I have to stay.”

&gt; “Because I *am* this kingdom.”

---

No one speaks.

No one *has* to.

Because every Straw Hat is listening **with their whole heart**.

Even **Zoro**, eyes closed, jaw tight.

Even **Sanji**, blinking fast.

Even **Usopp**, already tearing up like someone broke a faucet behind his goggles.

---

She looks down for a moment, then up again.

&gt; “I’ll always consider you my friends.”

&gt; “And I hope…”

&gt; “I hope one day, when the world is kinder—when I can travel without fear—”

&gt; “I’ll find you again.”

---

She raises her hand.

Two fingers crossed.

**The mark of a Straw Hat crew bond.**

---

And across the ship, one by one, **they raise their arms in silence**.

All seven of them.

Every fist in the air.

---

And for a moment, the world holds its breath.

---

**You stand behind her**, watching this moment unfold.

You’re not a pirate.

Not royalty.

Not a Marine.

Just a man who knows what it means to say goodbye to children **you helped grow up**, even if only for a little while.

You feel that ache in your chest again.

The same one you felt in the palace.

But this time?

**It’s not from injury.**

---

**Tashigi**, beside you, is quiet.

Not unmoved.

Just giving them their space.

Just letting the girl say her piece, **as a princess and as a friend.**

---

The crowd stays silent.

Even the guards don’t speak.

The Going Merry rocks softly, ready to go.

---

**OOC:**
- This was Vivi’s goodbye—true, final, brave.
- The Straw Hats understand.
- The moment is yours, now. If you wish to step forward, you can.

Would you like to:

1. {Say your own farewell to the crew.}
2. {Speak privately to one Straw Hat (choose).}
3. {Hang back. Quietly observe, then leave.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - Oi, straw boy. Say ahhh-

Wait for his reaction

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates – A Teacher’s Goodbye]**  
**Scene: “One Last Lesson”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Playful | Mood: Heartfelt, Humorous, Laced with Real Respect**

---

The crew still stands with fists raised, the wind tugging at their coats, cloaks, and hair.

Vivi’s gaze lingers on them, not quite ready to turn away—

And you?

You finally step forward.

No ceremony.

No grand entrance.

Just a voice.

Dry. Familiar. **Yours.**

---

&gt; “Oi, Straw Boy.”

Luffy turns, slowly, blinking like he didn’t expect to hear you.

---

You raise one arm, a small glint of green already forming in your palm.

&gt; “Say *ahhh—*”

---

He grins like a kid at recess.

&gt; “AHHHHH!”

---

*PFFFSSHT!*

A perfect arc of **sweet golden kiwi juice** hits him square in the mouth.

He throws both arms in the air like he just won a prizefight.

&gt; “YEAHHH! That’s the GOOD stuff!”

---

**Sanji** smirks from the side, cigarette dangling from his lips.

&gt; “You’re gonna rot his teeth before he even makes it back to the Grand Line.”

---

**Zoro**, arms crossed:

&gt; “Didn’t think you were sentimental.”

---

You shrug, casually.

&gt; “I’m not.”

A beat.

Then softer.

&gt; “But he kept my kids safe. I owe him that much.”

---

**Chopper’s ears twitch.**  
**Usopp’s lip wobbles.**  
**Nami’s smile is real, but tired.**

---

Luffy walks toward you a few steps.

Still chewing.

Then offers a hand—sticky, cheerful, **full of sincerity.**

&gt; “You’re a weird guy.”

&gt; “But you’re a good guy.”

---

You take it.

Grip firm.

&gt; “Don’t let the world chew you up, Straw Boy.”

You nod toward his crew.

&gt; “They need you upright.”

---

Luffy grins wider.

&gt; “Nah, they’ll be fine.”

&gt; “But I’m still gonna punch anyone who messes with them.”

---

He releases your hand.

Turns.

Heads back toward the ship.

---

You stand still, watching them load, one by one.

You may never see them again.

But you’ll remember the lesson.

And **so will they.**

---

**OOC:**
- You said goodbye to Luffy in your own way—dry, sincere, flavored with fruit.
- You’ve left a lasting impression on him—and the crew.
- They respect you. You mattered to them.

Would you like to:

1. {Say one last thing to the group before they go.}  
2. {Return to Vivi and Tashigi—walk away together.}  
3. {Speak privately to one other Straw Hat (choose).}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - watch then set sail, then return to the palace. Might run into Smoker.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates – The Departure]**  
**Scene: “The Ones Who Keep Walking”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Satisfying, Gentle, and Forward-Looking**

---

You stay just long enough to see the **Going Merry** catch the wind.

The oars beat.

The sails bloom.

The crew waves once more—wild and free and loud—and just like that, **they’re gone**.

Heading back into the Grand Line.

---

You don't wave.

You just watch.

A teacher to the end.

Watching his students leave the classroom for the last time.

---

**Vivi watches too.** Silent now. Her hands clasped in front of her, trembling slightly.

**Tashigi** gives you a quiet nod as the ship vanishes behind a soft curve of canyon and light.

&gt; “They’ll be alright,” she says, mostly to herself.

&gt; “Somehow.”

---

You turn from the gate.

Time to walk back.

Your body complains.

But your soul?

Your soul is lighter.

---

---

**[Palace Steps – Early Afternoon]**  
**Scene: “Smoke Signals”**  
**POV: You**

---

The guards nod you in, not even questioning your limp or the pineapple-scented aura you still carry.

You make it halfway up the steps when you hear—

&gt; “So.”

The voice is low, gravely, familiar.

&gt; “You’re the reason this place smells like juice for the next three decades.”

---

**Smoker** leans against a scorched column at the top of the stairs, coat flared open, two cigars burning at once like twin engines of judgment.

He looks at you.

Really looks.

Not just assessing your limp, your bandages, your haggard face—

But **who you are now**.

What you've become.

---

&gt; “Not bad... for a schoolteacher.”

---

Would you like to:

1. {Greet Smoker properly – no fear, no shame.}  
2. {Deflect with humor. You’ve been through worse.}  
3. {Ask if you're under arrest. Half-seriously.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 / 3 - Salute the Captain. Captain Smoker. Glad to see you alright. Saw you take a few from the Croc. Thanks for the assist.

...I'm not under arrest or anything, right?

OOC: give me a window to respond to dialogue

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Steps – Under Smoky Scrutiny]**  
**Scene: “Teacher. Civilian. Hero.”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Formal | Mood: Tense, Dryly Cordial, Laced with Mutual Respect**

---

You straighten up as best you can, shift your weight off your worse leg, and lift your hand into a crisp, respectful salute.

**Not sloppy.**  
Not mocking.  
**Not submissive.**

Just… *correct.*

&gt; “Captain Smoker.”

&gt; “Glad to see you alright.”

A faint smile touches your lips.

&gt; “Saw you take a few from the Croc. Thanks for the assist.”

---

**Smoker’s brows twitch upward**—not in surprise at the tone, but at the *fact* you used it.

He puffs his cigars slowly, letting silence settle between you.

---

You hold the pause, then add—more carefully:

&gt; “...I’m not under arrest or anything, right?”

You say it as lightly as you can.

But your eyes don’t leave his.

---

**Smoker exhales. Long. Slow. The cloud rolls around you like a curtain.**

Then—

He lets out a snort.

&gt; “If I arrested every citizen who stepped in when the Marines didn’t, I’d need my own prison fleet.”

---

He walks down one step, arms folding across his chest, the coat shifting in the breeze like it’s caught its own storm.

&gt; “You acted without orders. Engaged a Warlord. Used an unregistered Devil Fruit in a sovereign conflict.”

He looks you dead in the eyes.

&gt; “And you saved lives doing it.”

---

Another puff.

&gt; “As far as I’m concerned?”

&gt; “You did my job.”

---

He holds out a hand.

Broad. Calloused.

&gt; “Thank you, Mister Cheng.”

---

**OOC: You may now respond.**

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Shake it. I have to say, this entire ordeal was all a bad coincidence...

OOC: Tashigi and Vivi observe 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Steps – Recognition Earned]**  
**Scene: “The Shake That Meant Something”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Mutual Respect, Quiet Observation**

---

You clasp Smoker’s hand.

Firm.

Solid.

The grip of two men who have nothing to prove, but still choose to acknowledge each other.

Your voice stays even, no bluster, no bragging.

&gt; “I have to say…”

&gt; “This entire ordeal was one *hell* of a bad coincidence.”

---

Smoker’s mouth curls just slightly at one corner.

&gt; “That’s the Grand Line for you.”

&gt; “People go looking for fortune…”

He releases your hand.

&gt; “And end up in revolutions.”

---

Behind you, **Vivi** stands quietly near the column, her expression soft, proud, but wary.

She’s watching you like someone seeing a bridge form between two worlds—Marine and Civilian, Power and Principle.

---

**Tashigi**, a few paces off to the side, stands at attention.

But her arms are relaxed now.

And there’s just the faintest smirk tugging at her mouth as she watches the handshake.

---

She says nothing.

But her look says enough.

&gt; *“I told you they’d recognize it.”*

---

Smoker steps back slightly, gaze flicking toward them both.

&gt; “You’ve got good people standing beside you.”

&gt; “Don’t waste that.”

Then, back to you:

&gt; “You walking back into your old life after this?”

&gt; “Or are you thinking of something… bigger?”

---

**OOC: You have the floor. You may speak your truth—or play coy.**</pre>
