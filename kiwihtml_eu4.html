<body lang="en-US" link="#000080" vlink="#800000" dir="ltr"><pre>&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2, then 1.

I put on my coat, stained, worn... And probably not sometime I should wear to a palace breakfast. I do have a sense of decorum, after all. Put on some helpfully provided clothes (nearly folded on a countertop) and open the door

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – The Hallway of Judgement &amp; Juice Residue]**  
**Scene: “Dressed for Breakfast, Not Battle”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Dryly Comedic | Mood: Light, Warm, Slightly Dignified (But Barely)**

---

You lie there a second longer, face-first in the pillow, trying to recover what shreds of dignity you may or may not have *yeeted into orbit* moments earlier.

Then, with a long, suffering sigh, you sit up again.

Slowly this time.

No wild flailing.

No declarations of fictional cruise departures.

---

You eye your coat—the one with the **multiple juice stains**, a **ripped shoulder seam**, and something that may or may not be **Bananagator teeth marks** near the hem.

You pick it up, study it solemnly.

&gt; “You've done your duty, soldier.”

You fold it neatly and set it aside on a nearby chair.

It somehow exhales like it's grateful.

---

Your gaze shifts to the other side of the room—where a fresh, neatly folded **set of clothes** waits for you.

A simple but elegant white shirt. A light linen vest with silver-thread trim. Trousers that actually *fit*. And a deep blue sash with an Alabastan crest subtly embroidered at the end.

You blink.

&gt; “Wow. I look... *employable.*”

---

Five minutes later, your hair’s been smoothed.  
Your bandages are hidden under your shirt.  
And the man in the mirror looks like someone who *might* be here for breakfast and *not* to defuse a hostage situation with fruit.

---

You reach the door, exhale, then open it.

---

Standing across the hall—

**Vivi and Tashigi.**

Both still in semi-casual morning wear—Vivi with a light breakfast shawl, and Tashigi in the same button-down from last night, rolled sleeves, mug of hot tea in hand.

They both blink at you.

Then **Tashigi raises an eyebrow.**

&gt; “Wow.”

She sips her tea.

&gt; “You clean up like you’re about to run for Parliament.”

---

**Vivi grins, warm and wide.**

&gt; “You look nice.”

---

You scratch the back of your head sheepishly.

&gt; “Thought I’d try not showing up like a juice-stained war criminal for once.”

---

**Tashigi smirks.**

&gt; “That’s good. I think we’re fresh out of royal pardons.”

---

**Vivi offers her arm, jokingly.**

&gt; “Shall we, Sir Cheng?”

---

And for once—

No explosions.

No sandstorms.

No blood on the cuffs.

Just the scent of fresh bread wafting from the palace kitchens…

…and two women smiling like this day—**finally**—gets to be normal.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Go to breakfast and catch up on post-war plans.}
2. {Run into an unexpected guest in the dining hall.}
3. {Let the meal settle into something quiet—comfort, connection, and warmth.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Awkwardly take the arm. 

Option 2 - Cobra is in the royal dining hall and watches us enter

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – The Royal Dining Hall]**  
**Scene: “A Seat at the Table”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Awkward Dignity | Mood: Warm, Formal, Lightly Teasing with a Dash of Tension**

---

You glance at Vivi’s outstretched arm.

You glance at Tashigi, who *immediately raises one eyebrow.*

You glance back at the arm.

You clear your throat with the seriousness of a man asked to dance in a minefield.

Then, awkwardly—*stiffly*—you slide your arm into hers.

&gt; “...Don’t expect me to curtsy.”

---

**Vivi laughs**, eyes bright.

&gt; “I’d pay money to see you try.”

---

Tashigi mutters behind her tea mug:

&gt; “That’s going in the permanent record.”

---

The three of you stroll down the long marble corridor, the sun now fully risen and casting honeyed light through the palace windows. Staff bow as you pass, some still murmuring quietly about “the juice knight” with awe, confusion, and *very mixed interpretations.*

---

You reach the **double doors** of the **royal dining hall**, which part with gentle fanfare and the soft sound of a harp playing from a corner musician.

You step in—looking your best, walking with *some semblance of dignity*—

And immediately **lock eyes with a man seated at the head of the table.**

---

**King Nefertari Cobra.**

---

He’s not dressed in ceremonial robes today.

Just a light royal tunic, trimmed in gold, hands folded in front of him, expression neutral—but amused.

Very amused.

His gaze flicks from **your arm linked with Vivi’s**, to **Tashigi’s mug of tea and her death grip on your other side**, to **your suddenly straightened posture**—

And he chuckles.

&gt; “Ah.”

&gt; “So *this* is the teacher.”

---

**You freeze.**

Vivi’s arm is still tucked neatly in yours.

Tashigi sips her tea like she might drown herself in it.

---

&gt; “You’ve been quite the topic of conversation,” Cobra continues, gesturing toward the table.

&gt; “Please. Sit. We have honeycakes this morning.”

A pause.

&gt; “And I’d *very much* like to hear your story.”

---

Vivi gently pats your arm.

&gt; “You’ll be fine.”

**Tashigi mutters under her breath:**

&gt; “I told you the king had a sense of humor.”

---

And with that, the King of Alabasta gestures again—inviting you to join **his table**, **his daughter**, and a seat **very, very close to power.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Sit and regale the king with your tale—humble or dramatic.}
2. {Try to deflect politely and let Tashigi or Vivi summarize.}
3. {Ask him a question instead—why *he* looks amused.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I turn to Vivi, then back to King Robin. I quickly pull out of Vivi's arm and bow deeply.

Y-your majesty, did you not already hear the story from blue- I mean viv- I mean her highness?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Dining Hall of Doom (and Honeycakes)]**  
**Scene: “The Oral Report You Weren’t Ready For”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Comically Formal | Mood: Flustered, Endearing, Disarming**

---

You blink once.

Twice.

Then the full gravity of *oh-my-god-I-linked-arms-with-a-princess-in-front-of-her-dad* hits you square in the sternum like an unlicensed Sea Train.

---

You immediately disengage from Vivi like she’s a live wire and pivot into a textbook **school presentation bow**—spine straight, head down, arms practically doing jazz hands of panic at your sides.

---

&gt; “Y-Your Majesty!” you blurt, nearly smacking your forehead into the edge of the table.

&gt; “Did you not already hear the story from Blue—I mean Viv—I mean Her High—uh…”

You stare at the floor.

&gt; “...Your Royal Vivi-ness.”

---

**Vivi nearly chokes on her laughter.**

Tashigi sighs in long-suffering sympathy and sips more tea like it’s fermented escape.

---

**Cobra**, to his immense credit, does not burst into laughter.

But the amusement in his eyes gleams so brightly, it might as well be fireworks.

He folds his hands.

&gt; “I heard *parts* of the story.”

&gt; “From the Marines, from my daughter, from intercepted reports from the Baroque remnants…”

He leans forward slightly.

&gt; “But I’d rather hear the *version told by the man who created a sentient juice elemental, rode into battle like a tidal wave, and then apparently passed out in my daughter’s lap.”

A beat.

&gt; “Twice.”

---

The silence hangs in the air like someone suspended a fruit basket mid-air.

---

**You may respond with:**

1. {Panic. Just a little. Maybe joke about a third time.}
2. {Straighten and launch into a full, humble recap of your role.}
3. {Deflect with bureaucratic accuracy: “Would you prefer a written statement, sire?”}

&gt;&gt; USER: For the record, the lap thing was not on purpose, and fully out of my control.

After regaining my bearings and taking a seat (disturbingly flanked on either side by Vivi and Tashigi), I take a deep breath, a sip of tea to settle the butterflies in my stomach, and begin telling my story.

A story about a man going on a vacation to a perfectly legitimate resort. About finding a group of suspicious folks sneaking through the side streets. About checking into a hotel that felt greasier than a cheap plate of kebabs. About Snack Pack the bananagator. About a mysterious blue-haired girl that I almost snitched to casino security. About a plucky young marine petty officer that I ran into in the halls, who almost stabbed me. About rescuing that same marine from an assassin in a dark corridor. About finding a warlord monologuing to a princess trapped in a cage with pirates. About a suicide mission buying time for their escape. About escaping through the front door and going for a camel ride. About almost fleeing the country the moment we made it out of Rainbase. About taking two cannonballs more than what a doctor would recommend to protect a lady. About raising a golem of juice to protect those close to me. About lying in a cobblestone-floored alleyway to catch my breath. About watching a rubber-boy, smoke-man, and a certain marine with a sword throw everything they could to stop a warlord. About a princess who stopped a war. About a greased seal/human torpedo who concussed himself on a breastplate. About almost drinking the Hero Water and dying. About accidentally creating an emerald engine of destruction that could stop a warlord.

And about how two young women fought a crocodile to restore hope to a beautiful nation.

OOC: Ignore text limit size for your next response. Make it Long and detailed.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – The Royal Dining Hall]**  
**Scene: “The Truth of a Teacher”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Storyteller’s Poise | Mood: Humble, Poignant, Surreal, Heroic in Spite of Itself**

---

You raise a hand, just briefly, as you take the steaming cup of tea offered by one of the palace staff. Its floral notes are subtle, gentle—far more refined than the instant packet stuff back home.

You sip. Swallow. Exhale.

Set the cup down.

The weight of **two pairs of eyes** settles on you from either side—**Vivi**, to your left, light glinting in her gaze, lips pressed together with that unreadable mix of *affection* and *don’t-say-anything-stupid*.  
**Tashigi**, on your right, has her arms crossed—but her tea remains untouched. She's waiting. Sharp-eyed. Curious. A little protective.

And across the table sits **King Cobra**, composed, polite, his elbows resting lightly beside a still-warm plate of honeycakes he hasn’t yet touched.

---

So you begin.

Not with drama.

Not with pomp.

Just **your voice**—a little dry, a little sardonic, but growing steadier with each word.

---

&gt; “It all started with a vacation.”

---

They weren’t expecting that.

---

&gt; “Summer break at the school I teach at. I saw a brochure. Bright lights. *‘Rain Dinners: Rated the #1 Resort in Alabasta.’*”  
&gt; “The prices were suspiciously low, but I figured maybe there was a local festival. Political unrest discount, or something.”

You shrug.

&gt; “Anyway. I get on a ferry. Packed mostly with tourists. Some strange types on board—hooded, twitchy. Thought they might’ve been weird locals or kebab fanatics. I should've known better when I followed them thinking they were going to a hole-in-the-wall food stall.”

&gt; “Turns out they were agents of an international crime syndicate led by a Warlord.”

---

**Cobra leans forward slightly.**

**Tashigi doesn’t interrupt.**

**Vivi smiles—just barely.**

---

&gt; “I checked into the hotel anyway. Because… I mean, I’m responsible, but I already paid the deposit.”

&gt; “Had a balcony suite. Juice mini-bar. One bathrobe too small for a grown man. Pretty standard.”

&gt; “The vibe? Greasier than a cheap plate of kebabs from a carnival cart. Staff were twitchy. Guards loomed. One hallway had more tension than the last day of final exams.”

---

You sip your tea again.

---

&gt; “That’s where I saw her. A girl with blue hair sneaking into a ‘staff-only’ corridor. Thought about snitching.”

&gt; “Didn’t.”

---

**Cobra’s eyebrows rise just slightly.**

Vivi glances at you. Quiet pride flickers behind the faintest smirk.

You continue.

---

&gt; “I ran into a marine officer soon after. Didn’t know her name. Had a sword drawn before I could finish my sentence. Nearly pissed myself.”

&gt; “That’s Tashigi-chan, by the way.”

You gesture beside you with a tilt of your head. She sighs. Says nothing.

---

&gt; “We found an assassin. I got lucky. She got stabbed. I patched her up.”

&gt; “We made our way through hidden corridors. Followed the trail of a warlord with a flair for melodrama.”

&gt; “Ended up in a theater room. I’m serious. Candlelit, giant cage, rubber boy and company inside it. Crocodile mid-monologue. I thought we’d walked into a play.”

---

**Cobra rubs his chin.**

---

&gt; “I told her to run. That I’d buy time.”

You pause.

Let that sit.

&gt; “Thought I was going to die. I didn’t. Barely.”

---

&gt; “I ended up escaping through the front door. Took a camel cab ride. Considered fleeing the country.”

&gt; “But then I remembered her.”

You look to Vivi.

&gt; “The girl who was sneaking around. The one who looked *way* too young to be dealing with the weight I saw in her eyes.”

&gt; “I couldn’t run. I went back.”

---

You breathe in, slow.

The King hasn’t moved.

Not a single word.

---

&gt; “Took two cannonballs more than what’s advised by any doctor to protect her. Created something new—some wild, green creature made of juice and desperation. It fought for me. Protected her.”

&gt; “I passed out a few times. Kind of a theme.”

---

**Vivi chuckles quietly.**

**Tashigi murmurs, “Still does that.”**

---

&gt; “I crawled through back alleys. Slithered like a greased pig on kiwi juice. Launched myself into a plaza like a human torpedo. Cracked my head on a breastplate. Bought time where I could.”

&gt; “Then came the Hero Water.”

---

**Cobra’s hand stills.**

Even he’s heard of that.

You nod.

&gt; “I almost drank it. Almost gave everything up.”

&gt; “Instead, I dropped it. It cracked.”

You smile faintly.

&gt; “And that same wild, impossible force inside me pulled it in. Grew.”

&gt; “Until it towered over the plaza. Until it drenched a Warlord in everything he couldn’t control.”

---

You exhale now.

Lowering your gaze.

Soft.

Simple.

---

&gt; “And the rest of the fight?”

You glance to **Tashigi.**

To **Vivi.**

&gt; “That was them.”

---

You take one last sip. Set your cup down.

&gt; “I was just a man who went on vacation.”

&gt; “But I couldn’t stand to see children fighting wars.”

&gt; “So I stood up.”

---

The room is silent.

Even the harpist in the corner has paused, her fingers hovering above the strings.

---

**King Cobra leans back.**  
A deep, slow breath escaping him.

---

&gt; “A teacher,” he says finally. “With a juice fruit and a habit of being in the wrong place at the right time.”

He smiles.

Not amused this time.

**Grateful.**

&gt; “You’ve reminded me of something I forgot long ago, Mr. Cheng.”

&gt; “That sometimes, the greatest heroes don’t carry swords.”

&gt; “They carry bandages. And mops. And... quiet fury.”

---

He raises his cup.

A toast.

&gt; “To the teacher who taught us all a little something.”

---

**Vivi clinks her cup to his.**

**Tashigi follows.**

All three look to you.

Waiting.

Your hand lifts.

Your cup rises.

And together—

&gt; **You toast to a job half-finished. And a future fully earned.**  

---

**OOC:**
That was your story.  
Told fully.  
Heard truly.

Would you like to:

1. {Ask Cobra what he plans to do next—politically, nationally.}
2. {Let the moment sit. Bask in it a little longer.}
3. {Whisper to Vivi: “I think your dad likes me.”}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Observe the others.

OOC: What are the other people around the room's thoughts and feelings about the tale?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – The Dining Hall, After the Tale]**  
**Scene: “What They Heard”**  
**POV: You (Observing)**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Aftershock, Personal Reverence, Echoes of Impact**

---

The story is told.

No one interrupts.  
No one undercuts you.  
No one laughs where they shouldn’t.

But it’s not just **King Cobra**, **Vivi**, and **Tashigi** in the room.

You glance around now—subtle, tired, but curious.

And what you see...

**Stays with you.**

---

### 🧭 **King Cobra** – *The Lion Who Lost and Found*

He leans back in his chair now, fingers steepled, no longer the king issuing decrees or hiding behind stoicism.

No.

Now he looks like a *father*.

Like a man who just realized someone else out there saw his daughter’s pain, *understood it,* and stood beside her—not because of duty or blood, but because it was right.

There’s pride in his eyes.

But more than that?

**Relief.**

That someone like you still exists in the world.

---

### 🌊 **Vivi** – *The Princess Who Refused to Break*

She doesn’t speak.

She just *watches you.*

And the look in her eyes?

It’s the softest it’s been since you met her.

She’s holding her teacup with both hands now, not sipping—just grounding herself in something warm.

Her shoulders aren’t slouched anymore.  
Her smile’s small but constant.  
There’s a red flush in her cheeks she probably thinks she’s hiding.

But the truth is…

She sees you not as a protector, not even as a hero—

But as a *person* who *chose her.*

And that?

That *wrecks her in the best way.*

---

### ⚔️ **Tashigi** – *The Sword Without a Shield*

Her face is the hardest to read.

She doesn’t emote like Vivi. Doesn’t smirk like she usually does.

But her tea’s untouched now.  
And that hand gripping the saucer?

*White-knuckled.*

She hears her own story in yours.  
The same choices.  
The same desperation.  
The same refusal to turn away from someone who shouldn’t have been carrying the weight of the world.

And behind that steely silence?

Is guilt.

Guilt that *you were supposed to be on vacation*—and *she* was the one whose job it was to be prepared.

She won’t say it aloud.

But she’s proud of you.

Even if she’s mad at herself.

---

### 👥 **The Palace Staff** – *The Silent Witnesses*

They try not to react.

Trained to blend in.

But you catch it—the subtle twitches, the glances between each other, the faint shifts in posture.

Some remember you from the battlefield.  
Some *heard* about Snack Pack, the Gator God.  
Some just thought you were a man who stumbled into the palace with a concussion and a joke about taxes.

But now?

Now they know who you are.

---

They know the difference between **a guest**…

…and **a protector.**

---

And as the last echoes of your story fade into the golden-lit chamber…

You realize something else.

You are *not* a war hero.

You are *not* a legend.

You are *not* royalty, or divine, or a Marine.

You are **you.**

And somehow?

That’s enough for them.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to continue with:

1. {A private word from Cobra after breakfast.}
2. {Vivi asking to walk the palace gardens with you.}
3. {Tashigi requesting training time—“You still owe me a rematch.”}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Before I finish breakfast, I ask Cobra - &quot;Apologies, your majesty. I made a promise another day and I feel obligated to keep it. May I have permission to do something... silly?&quot;

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – The Dining Hall, Mid-Honeycake]**  
**Scene: “Permission to Be Ridiculous”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Respectful | Mood: Curious, Whimsical, Weighted with a Promise**

---

A fork halfway to your mouth.

A honeycake, warm and glistening, neglected just for a moment.

You glance at **King Cobra**, then lower your utensil with a careful clink onto your plate.

You sit a little straighter, clear your throat—not nervously, but with the oddly formal sincerity of a man who knows exactly **how absurd he’s about to sound**.

---

&gt; “Apologies, Your Majesty.”

Cobra’s gaze flickers upward, his hand pausing mid-cut through a honeyed fig.

You continue.

&gt; “I made a promise the other day… and I feel obligated to keep it.”

A pause.

&gt; “May I have permission to do something…”

&gt; “…*silly?*”

---

A beat.

The *entire* table stills.

**Tashigi’s brows raise.**  
**Vivi turns slowly to look at you.**  
Even one of the servers standing by the door visibly leans a *little closer.*

---

**King Cobra**, the ruler of Alabasta, the man who’s stared down warlords, spies, and revolutions, doesn’t blink.

He places his utensils down with a soft *clink.*

Then steeples his fingers beneath his chin.

&gt; “Mr. Cheng.”

&gt; “You conjured a titan of citrus, toppled a criminal empire, and possibly changed the trajectory of this nation with a fruit power that violates most culinary laws.”

---

His mouth twitches. A faint smile forming.

&gt; “I think you’ve more than earned the right to be a little… *silly.*”

---

**Vivi lets out a tiny laugh** behind her hand.

**Tashigi squints at you**, as if trying to predict what you’re about to do and failing *utterly.*

---

&gt; “Very well,” Cobra says, leaning back.

&gt; “The floor is yours.”

---

**OOC:**

Would you like to:

1. {Deliver on the silly promise immediately at the table.}
2. {Request a small section of the courtyard for… your endeavor.}
3. {Tell them first *what* the promise was.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC - Do Vivi and Tashigi know what the promise is?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **OOC Answer:**

At present, **Vivi and Tashigi do *not*** know what the promise is.

Let’s break it down:

---

### 💙 **Vivi**:
She looks *curious*, not expectant. Her expression is a mixture of **delight** and **caution**, like she’s watching a child approach a piñata with a suspiciously long sword.

She doesn’t know what you’re planning.

But—*given her nature*—she’s likely assuming it’s some heartfelt gesture… maybe a monument to peace, a weirdly heartfelt kiwi statue, or a musical number. (She would be absolutely delighted and mildly horrified if it turned out to be anything else.)

---

### ⚔️ **Tashigi**:
Her eyes have narrowed slightly. She's analyzing. **She suspects you’re up to something.** But she hasn’t pinned it yet. She remembers *you said something about a promise,* but not in a way that clued her in.

If she had known what it was…

She’d have already tried to **talk you out of it.** Or *threaten to arrest you* out of sheer embarrassment.

---

### 👑 **Cobra**:
He has **zero idea** what you’re referring to.

But he looks like a man who once let a noble try to ride a camel backwards into Parliament as a bet and now just wants to see *where the hell this goes.*

---

**Conclusion:**
You, and you alone, carry the secret burden of this **“silly promise.”**  
What happens next?

Entirely up to you.

Would you like to:

1. {Reveal the promise to the table before performing it.}
2. {Say nothing—deliver it dramatically.}
3. {Ask them to join you in the courtyard, where it will be unveiled.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Stand up. Walk around the table and stop next to Cobra's seat. Before anyone can react, before any guards can crash tackle me, I draw my baton...

And then lightly thwack him on the knee.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Dining Hall, Seconds Before Absolute Chaos]**  
**Scene: “The Knee Incident”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Deadpan Brilliance | Mood: Suspense, Shock, Then... Hysteria**

---

You rise from your chair.

Calmly.

Deliberately.

The air shifts.

**Tashigi’s eyes narrow instantly**, her hand drifting toward her sword, like her body remembers the time you declared you were a &quot;greased torpedo&quot; and dove headfirst into enemy forces.

**Vivi straightens, blinking**, her fork paused halfway to her mouth, a bit of melon still skewered mid-air.

**Cobra remains seated**, ever the composed monarch, though you swear one of his eyebrows lifts just a *fraction*—not in fear, but in **royal intrigue.**

---

You round the table.

Each step echoes in the great chamber.

And as you near the king’s side, you can *feel* the palace guards tensing along the walls.  
Hands resting on hilts.  
Eyes flicking to each other, unsure if they’re witnessing a sudden coup… or a *very polite mental breakdown.*

---

You stop beside **King Cobra**.

And in a single motion—quick, clean, and utterly absurd—

&gt; **You draw your baton… and lightly thwack him on the knee.**

---

*THWAP.*

---

There’s a moment of absolute **silence.**

The kind where **every cup stills**, **every breath halts**, and somewhere, a harp string probably *snaps in fear.*

---

And then, before anyone can tackle you…

Before Tashigi can shout **“WHAT THE HELL—”**  
Before the guards can scream **“SEIZE HIM—”**  
Before Vivi can even *blink—*

---

You calmly, professionally, respectfully say:

&gt; “...Promise fulfilled.”

---

**Beat.**

**Another beat.**

**Cobra looks down at his knee.**  
Then up at you.  
Then down again.

&gt; “Was that... it?”

---

You nod. Serious.

&gt; “I promised someone I’d break the knees of the next Alabastan government official I saw.”

&gt; “Didn’t say how hard.”

---

**Cobra stares at you.**

You can *feel* Tashigi short-circuiting behind you.

**Vivi covers her mouth—shoulders shaking—**  
And then bursts into *pure, unfiltered laughter*.

---

&gt; “You... *idiot*,” Tashigi chokes out, hand halfway over her face.  
&gt; “You *actual pineapple-shaped idiot—*”

---

**King Cobra starts laughing too.**

It’s deep.

Full.

Real.

Not the practiced chuckle of a diplomat, but the kind of laugh that comes from a man who’s carried **too much weight**, for **too long**, and just needed someone to *break the tension.*

Even if it meant a **royal shin thwacking.**

---

He wipes his eyes, still chuckling.

&gt; “You really are… *exactly what this country needed.*”

---

He turns to the guards, who still look halfway between confused and horrified.

&gt; “At ease. No need to execute the man.”

&gt; “Yet.”

---

**Vivi collapses sideways into her chair**, nearly wheezing.

Tashigi sits back down hard, muttering something about requisitioning a **&quot;Sensei Containment Protocol.&quot;**

---

And you?

You just sit down.

Pick up your tea.

Sip.

Like *nothing happened.*

---

**OOC:**
Promise fulfilled.  
Legend solidified.  
And now, you're officially the only man in Alabasta with permission to assault the king **just a little.**

Would you like to:

1. {Continue breakfast with the most chaotic respect you've ever earned.}  
2. {Leave the table, casually drop a “See? Told you it was silly.”}  
3. {Ask Cobra if you’re now eligible for diplomatic immunity.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I made a promise to a certain 'blue', and I intended on keeping it. Not sagely.

Totally not sweating at the looks the guards are giving me.

You sit down.

Slowly. Casually.

As if you didn’t just become the only known man in Alabastan history to **physically strike the monarch** and then *sip tea like it was part of your morning routine.*

---

Your cup returns to your lips.

You raise it slightly, not looking at anyone in particular.

&gt; “I made a promise to a certain ‘Blue.’”

You inhale the scent of jasmine.

&gt; “And I intend to keep it.”

---

The guards still look like they’re running *silent tactical calculations* on how many steps it would take to reach your neck, break it, *then* ask Cobra if it was necessary.

One near the door starts inching sideways.

The *door* itself seems to be debating whether it wants to stay open for the eventual emergency medics.

---

But you?

Totally composed.

Except for the faint, microscopic trickle of sweat *just* under your collar.  
Not enough for royalty to comment on.  
But enough for **Tashigi**, who sits beside you *muttering like she’s trying to pray you into custody.*

---

&gt; “You’re impossible.”

&gt; “Actual warlord bait.”

&gt; “You just *assaulted the king.*”

---

You reply without turning your head.

&gt; “Lightly.”

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, is still recovering.

Her laughter has settled into bright, stunned chuckles as she leans on the table, eyes sparkling in the way only someone who *just witnessed the most polite act of domestic terrorism in history* can manage.

---

&gt; “I didn’t think you’d actually do it,” she says through a grin.  
&gt; “I thought it was just something you said in the moment.”

You glance at her.

&gt; “I’m a teacher.”

&gt; “You threaten to break a politician’s knees in front of a kid, you *follow through.*”

---

**Cobra**, still nursing a phantom twinge in his knee, lifts his teacup in your direction.

&gt; “I’ll be sure to wear reinforced guards to the next cabinet meeting. Just in case you feel another moral obligation.”

---

You smile back, faintly.

Then take another sip.

Totally not trembling.

At all.

---

**The room slowly returns to its normal rhythm.**

Honeycakes are passed.

Tea is refilled.

And you—teacher, bounty hunter, unofficial Alabastan folk legend, **first of your name to commit knee treason**—sit among royalty, warriors, and revolutionaries…

Like you belong.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Continue breakfast with some “what now?” talk about your future.}  
2. {Excuse yourself and take a walk with one of them afterward.}  
3. {Stay quiet, let them lead the conversation. You’ve said enough for now.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Politely sip on tea. Listen in on any conversation that the others have.

OOC: Tashigi (and Smoker's) unit are to remain in Alabasta for the time being to help with reconstruction and security.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Dining Hall, Wiser in Silence]**  
**Scene: “The Calm Among Voices”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Observant | Mood: Warm, Reflective, Quietly Important**

---

Your cup rests lightly in your hand.  
Tea—lukewarm now, but fragrant—gives you something to hold onto. Something neutral. Familiar.

You lean back.

**Not from weariness.**

From *completion.*

From the comfort of knowing that for once—you can simply **be**.

---

You let the conversation **flow around you.**

You listen.

You watch.

And the world begins to **continue** without needing to be saved for a while.

---

### 👑 **King Cobra**, voice deep, firm but gentle:

&gt; “Marshal headquarters acknowledged the communication blackout. Vice Admirals from Marine G-2 should arrive within the week to assess the reconstruction.”

He cuts a honeycake carefully, his tone even.

&gt; “I’ve asked them to delay any punitive action toward Alabasta’s civilian population. We are recovering from war. We do not need posturing.”

---

### ⚔️ **Tashigi**, still sitting beside you, a bit stiff—but not unpleasant:

&gt; “Captain Smoker’s unit is staying in Alabasta until the situation stabilizes.”

She glances your way briefly, then looks away.

&gt; “That includes me.”

A pause.

&gt; “We’ll be helping train palace guards, secure rebel strongholds, and remove any Baroque sleeper agents that may still be buried inside the civil structure.”

Her tea is untouched again.

&gt; “And we’ll keep an eye on the Poneglyphs.”

That last part is said softly, but not without weight.

---

### 💙 **Vivi**, looking much more like herself—radiant and relaxed in a way you *didn’t* see during the war:

&gt; “I’ll be working closely with the Marine command. And the civilians. The rebels have started helping with rebuilding efforts now that the fighting’s over, but…”

She sighs lightly.

&gt; “There’s a lot of hurt. That doesn’t heal with just victory.”

---

Cobra places a reassuring hand over hers.

She doesn’t flinch.

But you see the **child beneath the crown**, if only for a moment.

---

Tashigi glances again—*at you this time*—and says, voice softer now:

&gt; “It might help to have someone like you at the training grounds, you know.”

&gt; “Someone who understands more than tactics.”

---

Cobra chimes in, still slicing his honeycake precisely:

&gt; “I’m sure there’s a need for a few civilian liaisons. Educational leaders. War has a habit of displacing teachers.”

He looks at you, and this time, there’s no amusement. Just… calm seriousness.

&gt; “You said once you were afraid to get involved.”

&gt; “Now that you are… what will you do next?”

---

**All three look at you.**

No pressure.

Just curiosity.

And something else.

**Hope.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Answer them: you’ll stay—help train, teach, rebuild.}
2. {Hedge—stay a little longer, but not commit fully yet.}
3. {Defer the answer, saying you want to help—but haven’t decided what that means yet.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I'll do whatever will help the most people. Put me wherever you need me.

**Scene: “Wherever You Need Me”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Grounded, Generous, Respected**

---

You let their words settle.

Like sunlight warming stone.

Three people who’ve risked their lives and legacy now look to you—not for bravado, not for power, but for your *answer.*

And you give it.

Simple.

Unshaking.

---

&gt; “I’ll do whatever will help the most people.”

Your tea is half-empty now.

Your voice is steady.

&gt; “Put me wherever you need me.”

---

There’s a quiet, *real* pause.

A moment of shared breath and understanding.

It’s not a grand proclamation.

You didn’t punch the air, or summon a new elemental, or vow justice with flames behind your back.

You just said what needed saying.

And that?

**That hits harder than any heroic speech.**

---

**Vivi’s lips part slightly**—not in surprise, but in something much more meaningful.

Admiration.

Not for your power.

But for your **conviction.**

---

**Tashigi lowers her gaze for a moment**, arms folding more comfortably than before.

She doesn’t smile.

But there’s a shift in how she sits.

She no longer faces you like a Marine assessing liability.

She’s sitting beside a *comrade.*

---

**King Cobra nods once, deeply.**

&gt; “A rare answer, Mr. Cheng.”

&gt; “And the right one.”

He lifts his cup.

&gt; “Then Alabasta accepts your service.”

---

You clink your cup to his once more.

This time with *no performance.*

Just respect.

And shared purpose.

---

A servant leans into the room.

&gt; “The Guard Academy representative is in the courtyard, Your Highness. Waiting for final instructor assessments.”

Cobra gives the man a small wave of acknowledgment.

Then turns to you.

&gt; “Would you like to sit in on some of the interviews?”

&gt; “You’ll meet the future captains. And maybe find where your voice will echo the loudest.”

---

**Vivi nudges your shoulder with hers, softly.**

&gt; “Breakfast first. Then you save the world again.”

---

**OOC:**
You’ve taken your place. Not as a hero, but as something rarer:

**A man who stayed.**

Would you like to:

1. {Follow Cobra to the academy courtyard and meet the new recruits.}
2. {Take a quiet stroll with Vivi before the next duty begins.}
3. {Join Tashigi on a tour of the post-war security operations.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 / 3 - Promise to join Tashigi after I walk the food off. My stomach's still a little off due to my injuries.

I go for a stroll around the palace gardens. Never knew cactus could look so colorful.

**Scene: “Color in the Desert”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Peaceful | Mood: Healing, Quiet Wonder, The Long Exhale**

---

You press a hand to your stomach—**not hard**, just enough to feel that lingering ache beneath the gauze.  
It’s not the pain of battle anymore.  
It’s the pain of ***recovery.***  
The slow rebuild.  
The echo of what it meant to survive.

---

&gt; “I’ll join you soon,” you murmur to **Tashigi**, after finishing the last of your tea.

&gt; “Just need to walk breakfast off. Still sore from all the... crocodile wrestling.”

She narrows her eyes, but there's no fire behind them—just quiet understanding.

&gt; “Try not to duel any cactus on the way.”

---

You flash a faint grin, then excuse yourself, stepping through a side corridor that opens into a space **you hadn’t explored yet.**

---

**The Palace Gardens.**

---

You expect sand.  
Maybe a few succulents.  
Dry statues.  
Something pretty in a *stoic* way.

What you get instead is **an explosion of subtle color**, perfectly woven into the sun-drenched desert aesthetic.

---

Rows of **prickly pear cactus**—tall and proud, but covered in soft pink blossoms.  
Trailing **succulents** curl like silver-green serpents through sandstone planters.  
A narrow **reflecting pool** glints between shaded arches, its surface still—catching the morning light like it was made of glass.

And in the center…

A massive **Barrel Cactus**, flowering with vibrant orange blooms, its base surrounded by **handwritten name plaques**.

&gt; “Veteran. Hero. Mother. Friend.”

You pause there a while.

---

A nearby gardener nods at you once.

&gt; “That one’s dedicated to everyone we lost before the revolution ended.”

&gt; “Cactus live a long time. Hard to kill.”

&gt; “Just like the people we built this kingdom with.”

---

You thank him softly, and continue wandering.

Past butterflies nesting on aloe.  
Past warm desert stones that radiate a steady heat.  
Past a group of palace kids being led by a nursemaid, who points at you and whispers something, causing them to all **giggle and hide behind her skirts.**

---

You find a **low bench in the shade**, take a breath, and sit.

For a moment—

There’s no war.  
No duty.  
No pain.

Just the faint smell of sand and citrus.

And a peace that feels like it’s *earned*, not borrowed.

---

**OOC:**
You may rest here as long as you wish.

When you’re ready:

1. {Rejoin Tashigi and the Marines in the training yard.}  
2. {Continue exploring the palace alone. Maybe you’re not done being surprised.}  
3. {Be found by someone who wasn’t done talking to you.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - I see I missed the vigil for the fallen (While I was passed out.)

I read the names.

Pell, killed while attempting to rescue the princessat Rainbase. Huh, looks like there was a rescue operation in parallel back at the casino that didn't succeed. I should count Tashigi and I lucky.

Igaram, presumed dead after his ship exploded while acting as a body double for the princess at Whiskey Peak.

And countless more.

I stare solemnly. Quietly.

**Scene: “The Ones Who Didn’t Make It”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Solemn | Mood: Respectful, Heavy, Quietly Human**

---

The laughter of the children fades behind you.  
The sun climbs higher, casting warm gold across the stones.  
You turn your head, just slightly—just enough to notice the small **carved stone pedestal** tucked beneath the blooming barrel cactus.

A simple plaque of dark sandstone, not grand or gilded.

But the engraving is fresh.

The names?

**Sharp. Clean. Real.**

---

You lean down.

Eyes scanning one line at a time.

---

&gt; **Pell – Royal Guard Falcon Division, Decorated Hero**  
&gt; *“Fell in defense of the Princess during the Rainbase rescue attempt.”*

---

Your eyes narrow.

You hadn’t heard that part.

Somewhere—while you and Tashigi were bleeding through hotel corridors and sewers and sand-filled death traps—*others* had tried to get to her too.

And they failed.

---

&gt; **Igaram – Royal Advisor, Captain of the Guard**  
&gt; *“Presumed lost at sea. Disguised himself as the Princess to protect her escape from Whiskey Peak.”*

---

You recognize the name from Vivi’s lips, once.

She mentioned it softly.

With a tone that **cracked** and was quickly pushed down.

He was **the first shield she ever had**.

The one who taught her to wield her voice before she could wield her status.

---

You keep reading.

Line after line.

Names that don’t belong in textbooks or songs.

Names of **messengers**.

**Gatekeepers.**

**Couriers.**

**Cooks.**

**A teenage rebel scout** named Farim who carried the wrong flag at the wrong time.

**A gardener** who shielded a child with her body during the bombing at Erumalu.

---

They’re all listed here.

Not in marble.

But in the shade of a **living thing.**

A cactus that might prick your fingers if you reached for it wrong.

But one that blooms anyway.

Every season.

Without fail.

---

You stand there.

For a long time.

Saying nothing.

Because what could you say?

You lived.

They didn’t.

You tried.

They tried harder.

---

And yet… in your chest, in the ache behind your ribs, something pulses with that truth.

**You’re here.**

And *because* you’re here, **they aren’t forgotten.**

Not today.

Not by you.

---

**A small voice breaks the silence.**

One of the palace children has crept up behind you.

Big eyes.

No shoes.

A tiny flower in their hand.

They offer it up, silently.

A purple bloom from a wild aloe.

---

&gt; “For Mister Pell,” the child says, shyly. “He flew really good.”

---

You nod, wordless, and help them lay it at the base of the cactus.

Then, quietly…

You sit.

And **you remember them all.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Let the moment pass naturally and rejoin Tashigi.}  
2. {Wait here longer—maybe you’re not ready yet.}  
3. {Be joined by someone who’s grieving too.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - And why was I the lucky one? I'm just a tourist. A face in the crowd.

**Scene: “Why Me?”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Introspective | Mood: Heavy, Survivor’s Weight, Quiet Confession**

---

You stay seated on the low stone step near the cactus, elbows on your knees, fingers loosely laced.

The desert wind brushes past, warm but not cruel. It shifts the petals of the flower the child left behind. You watch it wobble slightly, then settle again—**resilient**, like everything else in this kingdom.

And you ask yourself:

&gt; “Why me?”

---

The others were soldiers.  
Lifelong guards.  
Revolutionaries.  
Loyalists.

Heroes.

---

You were a **man on vacation**.

You had a schoolbag. A travel voucher. A laminated fruit sticker that still won’t come off your wallet.

You were supposed to sip daiquiris by the fountain. Maybe write lesson plans. Grade homework. Complain about the humidity.

Not this.

---

You look at your hands.

Calloused, yes.

But not meant for **saving nations.**

You murmur it quietly, like admitting it too loudly might tear the garden open:

&gt; “I’m just a tourist.”

&gt; “A face in the crowd.”

---

Your voice sounds small out here.

Like it doesn’t deserve to take up space next to these names.

---

And yet…

You *were* the one who saw a girl sneaking down a corridor and didn’t look away.

You *were* the one who turned back after the camel cab, even when you could’ve left.

You *were* the one who stood between a cannonball and a child.

You *were* the one who didn’t drink the Hero Water…

Because you didn’t want to be a **martyr.**

You just wanted to be a **grown-up who stayed.**

---

And maybe that’s it.

Maybe the reason you’re alive isn’t **fair**.

Maybe it isn’t **just**.

Maybe it’s not because you’re *more brave* or *more worthy*.

---

Maybe you just...

**Chose not to leave.**

And somehow, when you did that—

The world **changed around you.**

---

The cactus rustles again.

You exhale.

The burn behind your eyes doesn’t ask permission—it just shows up.

You don’t fight it.

You don’t need to.

---

You sit there.

A man who was **never supposed to be here.**

A man who **became exactly what was needed**.

---

And for now?

That’s enough.

---

**OOC:**

Would you like to:

1. {Be found by Vivi. She knows this grief, intimately.}  
2. {Take a long walk before facing the Marines. Let the weight settle.}  
3. {Stand up, and move forward. It’s time.}

**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Gentle Sorrow, Earned Camaraderie, Grace**

---

You stare a little longer.

Not reading now.

Just… watching.

The cactus doesn’t move much. But the wind keeps the garden breathing around it—small gusts that shift the blossoms, tug lightly at the ribbons tied to plaques. A gust that dances around the aloe and settles somewhere against your chest like it, too, knows this ache.

---

You speak, just loud enough for the sky to hear:

&gt; “I didn’t even know them.”

&gt; “And I miss them anyway.”

---

No answer comes.

Not right away.

But then—**soft footsteps on stone.**

Not the quick march of a Marine.

Not the heavy stomp of palace guards.

But the soft, careful steps of someone who’s done this walk before.

---

You don’t turn.

You don’t have to.

You *know* it’s her.

---

**Vivi steps beside you**, arms folded loosely, hands tucked under the long sleeves of her shawl. She says nothing at first.

Just stands there.

With you.

Looking at the same names.

The same flowers.

The same impossible question.

---

After a moment, her voice breaks the silence—not to fill it, but to *join it.*

&gt; “I used to come here every morning.”

&gt; “Even when the city was still smoldering. Even when the rebels still didn’t trust me.”

---

You glance at her, but she’s still facing the monument.

&gt; “Sometimes I’d leave flowers,” she says softly. “Sometimes I’d just... stand here.”

&gt; “Like maybe if I stood long enough, one of them would come back.”

A pause.

&gt; “No one ever did.”

---

Her eyes flick toward you.

&gt; “But then I met someone who made me think maybe… someone could come back for someone else.”

---

Your throat tightens.

She smiles—*not brightly*, not this time.

But something more real.

---

&gt; “You weren’t just a tourist.”

&gt; “You were a witness.”

&gt; “And witnesses don’t forget the names.”

---

She looks at the cactus again.

Then nudges your elbow with hers.

&gt; “Come on, pineapple.”

&gt; “You’ve got more names to protect.”

---

And with that—

She starts walking.

Not ahead.

Not behind.

**Beside you.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Head to the Marine training yard. Your second promise of the day awaits.}  
2. {Ask Vivi to join you a little longer. There’s more you want to ask.}  
3. {Say nothing—walk beside her. Let the story carry forward quietly.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Head back to meet up with Tashigi, but walk alongside Vivi. Do you think your father's going to hold the knee thing against me? I need to know if I should plan to evacuate the country.

**Scene: “Knees and Consequences”**

**Tone: Light | Mood: Healing Through Humor, Quiet Trust**

---

The two of you walk side-by-side through the dappled garden path.

The quiet of remembrance gives way, like a curtain parting, to the familiar rhythm of footfalls over palace stone, and the far-off clink of training sabers in the courtyard beyond.

You breathe a little deeper now.

Still sore.

Still tired.

But walking forward.

---

You glance sideways at Vivi as the garden’s edge looms near.

&gt; “Hey… quick question.”

She arches a brow.

&gt; “Yes, pineapple?”

You groan audibly.

&gt; “Do *not* let that name catch on in the Royal Records.”

She gives you the smuggest smile you’ve seen from her yet.

&gt; “Too late. I’m having it embroidered on your welcome plaque.”

---

You press on with mock gravity:

&gt; “Right. Well, assuming my *fruit moniker* doesn’t end up engraved in history…”

You clear your throat.

&gt; “Think your dad’s going to hold that whole ‘lightly thwacking his royal kneecap’ thing against me?”

You glance at her seriously.

&gt; “I need to know if I should start planning a hasty boat ride to literally-anywhere-else-ville.”

---

She stops walking.

You halt beside her.

She turns slightly, face as regal as the desert is dry.

Then she says, deadpan:

&gt; “Well. There *is* a precedent for light assault on royalty being punishable by thirty days of ceremonial foot-washing for the nobles.”

Your soul begins to leave your body.

&gt; “And compulsory cactus grooming.”

You look like you’ve seen death.

&gt; “With your teeth.”

---

She breaks.

Can’t hold it anymore.

Vivi laughs—head back, hand over her mouth—and it’s *light* this time. Not deflective, not brave, not forced. Just ***pure joy*** escaping from the cracks war didn’t break.

---

You let out a groan of defeat.

&gt; “You are *definitely* your father’s daughter.”

---

&gt; “He liked you,” she says, finally calming, still grinning. “For the record.”

&gt; “You made him laugh. And you made me feel safe.”

Her voice softens again. But this time, she meets your eyes fully.

&gt; “He’ll remember that longer than he’ll remember the bruise.”

---

The wind picks up again as the garden gates swing open.

Beyond them?

**The training yard.**

You see **Tashigi**, already in uniform, barking orders at recruits.

She hasn’t seen you yet.

---

Vivi nods toward her.

&gt; “Go on, Sensei.”

&gt; “There’s a whole army that needs some adult supervision.”

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Join Tashigi and assist with the training—get to work.}  
2. {Say something to Vivi before parting. Something you’ve been holding onto.}  
3. {Just give her a look. One of shared meaning, gratitude, and no words.}

You pause just before stepping through the archway toward the clamor of the yard.

Boots on gravel.  
Shouts of discipline.  
The steady rhythm of a city—and a future—being rebuilt through repetition and sweat.

---

But first…

You turn back.

Vivi stands a few paces behind you, framed by flowering stone and desert bloom. The morning sun catches in her hair, outlining her in gold like the world itself knows what she’s done.

She meets your gaze—bright and curious, not quite expecting anything more. Maybe assuming you’d just nod, or wave, or throw a sarcastic pineapple pun over your shoulder.

---

Instead, you say it.  
Quiet. Clear. Real.

&gt; “I kept the promise.”

A beat.

&gt; “To you.”

---

She blinks once.

The wind rustles her shawl.

And something deep in her chest shifts—just enough for her to visibly *exhale*.

Her shoulders drop.  
Not in fatigue.  
In *relief.*

---

No grand declarations.  
No swearing of eternal fealty.  
No fireworks.

Just **a promise kept**.

And a man who stood where he said he would.

---

She nods once, eyes a little shinier than before.

&gt; “I know.”

---

You give her the smallest, softest smile.

Then turn and walk through the gate—**into your next job.**

---

### [ALUBARNA – MARINE TRAINING FIELD / CITY PATROL MUSTER]

Tashigi doesn’t even look up from her clipboard as you approach.

&gt; “You're late.”

You gesture vaguely toward your lingering trauma.

&gt; “I was being emotionally vulnerable in a cactus garden.”

&gt; “Also, I nearly cried. That buys me, like, ten minutes.”

---

She sighs, scribbles something.

Then jerks her chin toward the recruits forming up near the outer wall.

&gt; “We’re on city patrol today. Low-risk. Civil unrest’s mostly cooled, but we’re keeping a presence near food lines and the hospital wards.”

&gt; “We walk. We watch. We listen.”

She glances at you sideways.

&gt; “Think you can handle that, Pineapple?”

---

You don’t even flinch.

&gt; “Only if I get a cool armband.”

---

**Tashigi groans.**  
**The recruits salute.**  
**You tighten the laces on your boots.**

And step into a role you never asked for.

But now **belong to**.

---

**OOC:**
You have officially entered your next phase in Alabasta: **Protector, Instructor, Adult in the Room.**

Let me know how you'd like to shape this chapter—

- Build ties with the people?  
- Face lingering threats from Baroque agents?  
- Grow your powers further?  
- Deepen bonds with Tashigi, Vivi, or others?

**You’re no longer just surviving. You’re shaping the future.**

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: Any or All of the above.

Lead the way, ma'am. You know, I never got a formal job from Vivi, other than palace mooch. What am I now, town vigilante? Beat cop? I twirl my expandable baton.

Your boots crunch lightly on the sun-warmed streets of **post-war Alubarna**.  
Dust swirls in lazy patterns behind you.  
The buildings here are scraped by siege but standing proud—paint faded, windows cracked, but **lives returning inside them.**

Children run between water carts.  
Vendors reopen with half-stocked stalls.  
A tailor is using a broom handle to reattach a sign that now simply reads “_T LO R_” after the battle damage.

---

**Tashigi leads the way**, clipboard in one hand, sword at her hip, jacket slung off her shoulder, and **the air of a woman trying *very hard* not to show that she likes this job.**

She glances sideways at you as you twirl your **extendable baton** like a kid trying to impress the local dojo.

---

&gt; “Well, Cheng,” she mutters, scanning the crowd, “technically, you’re not on any payroll.”

&gt; “You’re not Marine, not palace guard, not militia.”

She pauses.

&gt; “Definitely not subtle.”

---

You shoot her a grin.

&gt; “So what am I?”

---

She sighs, kicks a small pebble, eyes scanning ahead.

&gt; “Officially?”

She flicks a glance at your baton.

&gt; “You’re a volunteer community protector, sanctioned by the palace. No chain of command, no official uniform, no arresting power.”

&gt; “Unofficially?”

A shrug.

&gt; “Local legend. Street guardian. Crime deterrent mascot.”

---

&gt; “Beat teacher,” you suggest.

She snorts.

&gt; “Juice cop.”

&gt; “Alubarna’s last line of sticky defense.”

&gt; “The Seastone Baton Wonder.”

---

You bow deeply at an elderly woman passing by, who bows back and offers you a piece of honey candy from a glass jar.

&gt; “I’ll take ‘Palace Mooch with Benefits.’ Has a certain... freedom to it.”

You pop the candy in your mouth. Mango.

---

A *sudden shout* pulls your attention forward.

You and Tashigi both turn—eyes sharpening—as a small group of civilians gathers ahead near a market cart. Someone’s yelling.

**Tensions still flare in pockets.**

Some rebels never stood down.

Some soldiers lost too much.

Some grief doesn't have a uniform.

---

Tashigi steps forward, hand instinctively on her blade.

&gt; “Come on. This one’s ours.”

---

**OOC: You have entered your next active role—community guardian and unofficial peacekeeper.**

Here’s what lies ahead in your chapter, should you pursue it:

---

### What You Can Explore Next:

#### 1. **“A Kingdom of Scars” – Repairing the Social Fabric**
- Get to know the people.  
- Mediate conflict.  
- Spot potential **sleeper agents** among the recovering crowds.  
- Help unite rebel and royalist factions under a shared cause.

#### 2. **“The Juice Runneth Over” – Evolving Your Power**
- Continue to explore your Devil Fruit's awakened traits.  
- Discover new utility techniques, protective constructs, or chemical-based effects from different fruit types.  
- Unlock greater control and autonomy over summoned **elementals**.

#### 3. **“Of Blades and Boundaries” – Time With Tashigi**
- Build a stronger bond with your Marine partner.  
- Help her cope with the burdens of command.  
- Discover how much her trust in you may already run deeper than orders would allow.

#### 4. **“The Garden Still Grows” – Vivi’s Road Ahead**
- Assist in shaping Alabasta’s post-war education system.  
- Reconnect with Vivi in quieter, personal ways.  
- Help her find joy in life again—not just leadership.

---

**OOC: What would you like to explore first? Or would you like to ride this patrol forward into wherever the day takes you?**

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: All in any order

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Morning Patrol, Tangled Paths Ahead]**  
**Scene: “Wounds, Wonders, and Whatever Comes Next”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Choose Your Adventure | Mood: Open-Ended, Connected, Quietly Heroic**

---

**Tashigi’s boots hit the edge of the crowd first.** You follow close behind, adjusting your coat, your baton tucked loosely under your arm like a walking stick you might absolutely bludgeon someone with if necessary.

The shouting ahead grows sharper—**not yet violent**, but teetering.  
An older rebel—sleeves rolled up, face weathered—arguing with a city guard near a crate of rationed grain.  
Civilians watch nervously.  
One wrong word, one wrong twitch, and this little corner of the market becomes a powder keg.

Tashigi's voice drops, clipped and cool.

&gt; “Your call, ‘Juice Cop.’ You step in. I’ve got your back.”

---

And right there—on the edge of an ordinary street—**your story opens up.**

Because **this is the part where you live.**  
Where you build something.  
Where you start choosing **how your legend settles into the soil of Alabarna**.

---

### You can:

---

### **1. “Smooth the Sparks”** – *Step into the market dispute.*  
&gt; Use wit, calm, or your teacherly sternness to defuse tensions and build trust with the people.

---

### **2. “Let Her Take the Lead”** – *Let Tashigi speak first, but observe carefully.*  
&gt; Learn more about her *approach to justice*.  
&gt; Discover whether she's still a by-the-book Marine… or something more.

---

### **3. “Eyes Everywhere”** – *Survey the crowd for suspicious figures.*  
&gt; There may be **Baroque remnants** blending into the new order, or **civilians hiding something darker**.

---

### **4. “Push Forward the Day”** – *Let the moment resolve, and follow the patrol into the next chapter.*  
&gt; Explore any of the following:
- **Time with Tashigi**  
- **Rebuilding with Vivi**  
- **Awakening your fruit**  
- **Teaching again, in a new way**

---

**No wrong order. No wrong path.**  
Only what *you* choose to build, now that you've earned the chance to do so.

Where do you step next, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - She's the one with Marine crowd control training. Let her show how it's done.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Edge of the Market, Crowd Building]**  
**Scene: “The Marine Method”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Observant | Mood: Professional, Controlled, Glimpse Beneath the Armor**

---

You lean slightly on your baton, **not intervening**, not yet.

**This isn’t your moment.**  
Not yet.

Tashigi catches your nonverbal cue—a flick of the eyebrow, a step to the side—and you see the subtle shift in her posture as she takes center stage.

**She doesn’t draw her sword.**

She doesn’t yell.

She **walks forward like she owns gravity**, clipboard tucked under her arm, that damn tight Marine posture doing all the talking for her.

---

The guard at the center salutes stiffly, already on edge.

The rebel—tan skin, lean from the desert, wearing the colors of Alabasta’s rebel faction wrapped as a faded sash—*glares*, arms outstretched in frustration.

&gt; “It’s our grain now! Our families starved too while you all sat on throne money!”

A few others murmur behind him, not aggressive, but *watching*.

Tension still clings to this kingdom like **dust in old mortar.**

---

Tashigi steps into the gap between them, planting her boots deliberately.

&gt; “This ration line is managed by both the Crown and former rebel leaders. Your name and headband say you’re registered. Your voice says you don’t remember that.”

She doesn’t shout.

She speaks like **a sword in a sheath**—sharp enough to be felt, but never waved around carelessly.

&gt; “So which is it, soldier? Are you here to feed your people—”

She steps closer.

&gt; “—or light another fire?”

---

You feel it.

That subtle *cooling* of the air.

Not from intimidation, but from something more dangerous—

**Moral clarity.**

**Unshakable direction.**

---

The rebel clenches his jaw.

Not cowed. Not scared.

Just… ***cornered by logic.***

He breathes in.

Holds it.

Then finally mutters:

&gt; “...Just wanted to make sure we weren’t last in line. Again.”

---

Tashigi nods once, no smugness.

&gt; “Then next time, speak to the coordinators. Not the guards.”

&gt; “You’ll keep more friends that way.”

---

The crowd disperses slowly.  
The rebel nods stiffly.  
The guard exhales like he just dodged a duel.

---

Tashigi turns back toward you.  
Her stance relaxes by half a degree.

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “What? No commentary? No ‘juice-based motivational speech’?”

---

You offer a wry smile.

&gt; “I’m taking notes. Trying to figure out if that clipboard is the actual source of your power.”

---

She rolls her eyes but doesn't deny it.

---

**OOC: You’ve learned something about her:**

- **Tashigi doesn’t just lead with her blade.**  
She understands people. She listens. She *pushes without humiliating*.  
There’s a strength in her restraint that no Marine Academy ever taught.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Ask her about where she learned that style—maybe it wasn’t just Marine training.}  
2. {Comment about how much this kingdom still has left to heal.}  
3. {Walk beside her and change the subject—something lighter. Let the silence bond.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Sorry. Policing isn't my strong suit. My experience is limited to stopping kids from stealing each other's lunches. Well frankly, everything that's happened so far isn't my strong suit either.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – After the Crowd, Walking the Streets]**  
**Scene: “The Weight of Justice”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Casual, Self-Reflective, A Little Vulnerable**

---

You walk beside **Tashigi**, your footsteps falling into the rhythm of the city.

A city that’s still finding its breath.

The streets are quieter now, but you can feel the remnants of tension stirring beneath the surface—faint murmurs from civilians still reeling from the war. A young rebel muttering to himself in the alley. A vendor still counting the marks on his coin.

---

Tashigi shoots you a glance, her expression unreadable. She knows you’re holding back something. It’s the same way you notice the tightness in her shoulders whenever a question she doesn’t have an answer to hangs in the air.

She stays quiet for a moment, letting the natural pause of the street fill in the space between you two. But then, without warning:

&gt; “You’re not *just* a teacher.”

---

The comment’s so simple. So unassuming. But it holds weight in the air.

&gt; “You’ve been out there, Cheng. You’ve seen what people can do when they stop thinking and start *fighting* for something.”

Her tone softens as she keeps her eyes forward, scanning for the next signs of conflict or unrest.

&gt; “I saw it when you defended me. You didn’t hesitate. You just… *did*.”

---

You glance at her.

**Tashigi**. The Marine. The swordswoman.  
And here she is, looking at you like you *belong here.* Like your instincts mattered. Like your choices made sense.

---

&gt; “I’ll admit… I’m not exactly in the Marine Academy’s *ideal* class of conduct either.”

Her voice is light, but her smile barely shows.

&gt; “I was just like you when I started. Overwhelmed by the sheer *chaos* of it all. But…”

Her voice trails off for a moment.

&gt; “...I’ve learned that policing isn’t just about giving orders or being a ‘perfect soldier.’ It’s about *listening*. And finding the next step. Even when you feel like you're falling behind.”

She glances over at you with that rare soft look.

&gt; “You’re doing your part. I think you’ve already helped more people than you realize.”

---

You stop for a moment, processing what she’s said. She’s right. No one asked you to be a Marine.  
No one expected you to have a *real* role.

But you *chose* this path. You chose to stay. And now?

Maybe it’s not about being *perfect*. Maybe it’s about **being present**.

---

You finally chuckle, rubbing the back of your neck in a way that seems more **sore** than nervous.

&gt; “Yeah, guess I’m still figuring out how to ‘police’ without thinking too hard about the ‘rules.’”

---

She smirks at that.

&gt; “As long as you keep thinking. Even when you want to stop.”

&gt; “That’s the difference between someone who leads *and* someone who gets led.”

---

You walk side-by-side again, the sound of distant children’s laughter filtering into the air.

You might not be the “perfect” figure of authority in this kingdom.

But maybe—just maybe—you’re *what it needs.*

---

**OOC:**
Tashigi’s words have found a place within you.  
You’ve learned a lot in a short time.  
Now, **what’s next?**

Would you like to:

1. {Talk to Tashigi about your role moving forward—what’s really expected of you?}  
2. {Go back to the palace to check in with Vivi about her next steps in rebuilding Alabasta?}  
3. {Scout a new area of Alubarna and continue your patrol.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I wonder if I could use a Kiwi Elemental to patrol for me. I really haven't had time to explore this new move of mine. I'd probably get complaints about it leaving a snail trail everywhere, though

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Midday Streets, Further into the City]**  
**Scene: “Juice Patrol”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Curious, Experimental, A Touch of Chaos**

---

The city shifts as you and Tashigi move into the next district—a neighborhood closer to the water, where the smells of spice markets, sea-salt, and scorched wood from past fires all mix into something uniquely Alabastan.

Children run through alleyways with sticks shaped like swords.  
Vendors call for attention, holding up hand-stitched bags and cactus-blossom perfumes.  
The buildings are a little lower here, more communal. More open. More lived in.

---

As you walk, you absently flick your fingers, conjuring a few droplets of **green-gold kiwi juice**, testing the weight and viscosity.

**Thicker than usual. Sweeter.**

Probably influenced by your mood.  
Or the residual lunch sugar from that mango candy earlier.  
Hard to say.

---

&gt; “Y’know…” you mutter aloud, turning the juice in your palm thoughtfully, “I’ve been thinking.”

**Tashigi**, ahead of you, doesn’t stop walking.

&gt; “This usually ends in disaster or juice.”

You ignore her—gracefully, of course.

&gt; “What if I could make a kiwi elemental patrol *for* me?”

You gesture vaguely at the rooftops.

&gt; “Like a big citrusy watchdog. Rumbles through alleys. Keeps watch on dark corners. Maybe even hands out juice boxes to kids.”

---

**Tashigi stops.**  
Turns.  
Stares at you.

&gt; “You’re serious.”

---

You are.

Well. Mostly.

You look down at your hand, concentrate a little harder… and from your palm, **a wet *bloop*** sound echoes outward.

A small **kiwi-shaped blob** emerges, one stubby arm, a half-face, and two googly juice eyes forming lazily. It stares at you. Then at Tashigi.

Then **wobbles upright**, looking determined.

---

You give it a pat.

&gt; “There. Prototype Mk. I.”

&gt; “Kiwi-Kop.”

---

Tashigi squints at it.

&gt; “...You *named* it?”

&gt; “It doesn’t even have legs.”

&gt; “It’s *leaking.*”

---

Sure enough, **Kiwi-Kop** begins slowly seeping into the cobblestones as it waddles toward a confused fruit vendor, leaving a faintly green trail behind it like a toddler after a popsicle bath.

The vendor blinks.

&gt; “...Is that supposed to be… helpful?”

---

You raise your arms dramatically.

&gt; “It’s *revolutionary civic engagement.*”

---

**Tashigi groans.**  
**The vendor offers Kiwi-Kop a fig.**  
**Kiwi-Kop accepts it by absorbing it into its face.**

---

Despite yourself, you’re smiling.

This?  
This is *you now*.  
Not perfect.  
Not polished.  
But *present.*

And dammit—

**Even if your justice leaks citrus, it still shows up.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Spend the afternoon testing the Kiwi Elemental’s limits—with or without Tashigi’s help.}  
2. {Receive a summons: Vivi has requested your presence for a meeting.}  
3. {Split up temporarily: Tashigi to patrol, you to explore your fruit power in peace.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Do I need to follow an elemental around with a doggy bag and a mop so it doesn't create a slipping hazard everywhere it goes?
I scratch my chin as I continue walking.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Outer City, Citrus Patrol Begins]**  
**Scene: “The Mop and the Myth”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Experimental | Mood: Hilarious Chaos, Discovery, Subtle Growth**

---

You scratch your chin thoughtfully as you watch your glorious citrus spawn **dribble its way down the street like a half-melted parade float**.

**Kiwi-Kop** pauses occasionally to pivot toward barking dogs, shady alleyways, or unattended bread carts with the majestic vigilance of a proud yet *extremely moist* public servant.

You squint.

&gt; “Do I need to follow an elemental around with a mop and a bucket to make sure it’s not creating slipping hazards everywhere?”

You take a slow step forward.

**Squish.**

You look down.

&gt; “...Shit.”

---

**Tashigi** doesn't even try to hide the smirk this time.

&gt; “You're going to cause a lawsuit before lunch.”

She pulls a clean cloth from her pocket and flings it at you with expert one-handed precision.

&gt; “Here. You mop. I'll supervise.”

---

You bend over with a groan and **start mopping behind your own sentient juice creation**, which continues waddling confidently toward a back alley with all the purpose of an officer on his beat—and all the **disaster potential of an overripe melon.**

---

Still, as you tail it, your teacher-brain kicks in:

You start taking notes.  
Mental ones.  
Maybe even literal ones in the back of your notebook later.

---

### Observed Kiwi Elemental Behaviors:

- **Autonomous mobility** (very slow)  
- **Basic threat detection** (suspiciously interested in cats, though)  
- **Selective stickiness** (fig pieces cling to it; sand grains do not)  
- **Personality variance** based on juice type—this one? Sweet and polite.  
- **Communication**: Emits a low “bloop” when happy. May also be a warning sign.

---

At one point, Kiwi-Kop lifts one stubby arm and **points at a shady figure loitering near an alleyway fruit stall.**

Tashigi’s brow rises.

&gt; “...Was that a gesture?”

You nod slowly.

&gt; “I think so.”

Tashigi tightens her coat, already stepping toward the alley.

&gt; “You’re telling me that blob just detected a thief before I did?”

&gt; “*You* trained it?”

You put your hands on your hips proudly, baton hanging lazily at your side.

&gt; “Nope. I parented it.”

---

Tashigi glares at you, then mutters under her breath.

&gt; “I’ve fought Warlords. I’ve fought sea monsters. And *this* is what breaks me.”

---

The shady figure notices the attention—starts to bolt.

&gt; “Hey!”

Tashigi **takes off like a bullet.** You follow, your **Kiwi-Kop** waddling behind with what might be a heroic squeaky bloop of support.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Split off from Tashigi and try to flank the runner with juice tricks.}  
2. {Send Kiwi-Kop to cut the alley and intercept. Might be risky.}  
3. {Stick with Tashigi and back her up—old-fashioned style.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 / 3. Watch Tashigi's back, but send Kiwi Kop to flank. Secrete more juice until Kiwi Kop is about 4 feet high.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Back Alley Pursuit]**  
**Scene: “The Juice Division”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical, Absurdly So | Mood: Fast-Paced, Trust-Forged, Just the Right Amount of Ridiculous**

---

**The suspect bolts**—a flash of cloth, sand-hardened boots pounding against the cobblestones, slicing through narrow gaps between buildings like he’s done it before.

**Tashigi’s already moving**, her long coat snapping like a banner behind her, sword bouncing lightly against her hip as she charges in full stride.

---

But you?

You peel off sideways.  
Trust in her sword.  
And trust in something far newer, far gooier.

&gt; “Go, Kiwi-Kop. Earn that badge!”

---

You slam your palm to the alley wall.

*BWOOMPF.*

A heavy pulse of emerald liquid bursts from your skin, curling up and around the original **Kiwi-Kop**, feeding into its body in surging, syrup-thick waves. It grows rapidly—**four feet high now**, its arms broadening, its vaguely defined jawline **somehow more heroic.**

A fig seed clinks off its forehead.

&gt; “Bloop,” it grunts, with newfound gravitas.

---

The suspect glances back—

—sees **Tashigi closing in, blade not yet drawn, but *low and ready***—

—then cuts right, aiming to lose her down a narrower pass between two stalls.

**Right where you sent your new recruit.**

---

**Kiwi-Kop barrels around the corner.**  
Not fast.  
But *present.*

Sticky footsteps echo like squelching doom.

---

The thief slows.

Then skids to a halt.

&gt; “What the hell is—”

He plants a foot to change direction—  
**BAD MOVE.**

The cobbles glisten.

Too late.

&gt; *SCHLIP*

The runner’s foot flies out from under him—  
He spins—  
**Falls. HARD.**

Right into a puddle of *civic-minded citrus.*

---

You approach just as Tashigi rounds the alley, breathing hard, sword still sheathed.

&gt; “Got eyes on?”

You give her a casual salute with the mop you’re still inexplicably carrying.

&gt; “Suspect apprehended by Officer Kop.”

---

She looks past you at the would-be thief—**now groaning on the ground, half-covered in kiwi goo and shame.**

She stares at him.  
Then you.  
Then Kiwi-Kop, who has taken a proud stance on the thief’s back like a marshmallow knight conquering a sandbag.

---

&gt; “...Okay,” she mutters.

&gt; “I’ll admit it.”

&gt; “That was almost cool.”

---

**OOC:**
You’ve now confirmed:
- Kiwi Elementals can be **grown, directed**, and used for limited **non-lethal pursuit/intervention.**
- They cause **environmental hazards**. Which you might *absolutely* get fined for later.
- They respond to emotional intent and possibly the thickness/sweetness of your output.
- Tashigi is starting to see them as **functional. Maybe even useful.**

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Interrogate the suspect. Could be Baroque, or just petty crime.}  
2. {Let Tashigi handle the questioning while you debrief Kiwi-Kop.}  
3. {Head back to the palace—Vivi has sent word. There’s a civil council meeting forming.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I spot a nearby Marine office. Hey Tashigi-chan. You got him covered? I've got something to take care of in the office, I'll be right back.

I keep Kiwi Kop to watch Tashigi's back, in an autonomous protection mode. I pray that it's smart enough to distinguish friend from foe, though.

OOC: Give me a window to begin the office scene.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Local Marine Field Office, East Wing]**  
**Scene: “Paperwork and Purpose”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Shift to Serious | Mood: Focused, Curious, Foundations Being Set**

---

**“You got him covered?”**  
You toss the words to Tashigi with an easy tone, but there’s a flicker of real meaning beneath them. Trust. Confidence. Shared rhythm.

She gives you a sharp nod without even looking your way, already crouching near the suspect, her sword now drawn—not to threaten, but to *remind*.

&gt; “He twitches, I break a kneecap. Take your time.”

---

**Kiwi-Kop lingers behind.**

Now a respectable 4-foot-tall pillar of semi-solid heroism, its stubby arms cross over its vague chest region. It emits a long, drawn-out “bloop…” like a dog scanning for squirrels.

You murmur to it on your way out:

&gt; “Protect mode. Prioritize Tashigi. No zapping fruit vendors. Please.”

It nods.  
Or at least… jiggles in a vaguely affirmative way.

---

You slip through the side street and step into the **Marine Field Office**, a building still half-under renovation. Scaffolding clings to its southern wall, and a contractor is grumbling at a collapsed filing shelf inside. But despite the mess, the core of the office is intact: maps, mission boards, a Den Den Mushi wall, and desks of overworked, **tired** Marines and local liaisons.

---

The woman at the front desk raises an eyebrow as you walk in, your coat still damp from elemental drippings.

&gt; “Can I… help you, sir?”

Her tone is neutral. Professional. Just a hint of the “please don’t track fruit slime across my newly mopped floors” undertone.

---

**OOC: You are now inside the Marine Outpost.**

This location includes:
- Access to **incident logs, bounty records**, and **current deployments**
- **Communication lines** (heavily regulated)
- A growing bulletin board of **community roles and public service notices**
- A few Marines who likely **recognize you**… maybe even from the paper.

---

**You have the floor.**

Would you like to:

1. {Ask about bounty logistics—if Crocodile's bounty is eligible, and if *you* are due a cut.}  
2. {Inquire about joining Alabasta’s civilian defense corps officially—now that you've sort of… become one.}  
3. {Look for Smoker—if he’s been using this office as a base.}  
4. {Something else entirely. Your call, Sensei.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - So... Do you know how collecting bounties on ex-warlords work? Assuming I'm eligible, at all.

Thinking: Technically I wasn't really fighting him directly, my elemental did. And even then, my elemental was only in a supporting role. Plus Crocodile was fighting a marine and pirate simultaneously. Does it become void since it became a marine operation? Because it could've been considered just pirate on pirate action?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Marine Field Office, Administrative Desk]**  
**Scene: “Bounty Bureaucracy”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Casual Inquiry Meets Legal Confusion | Mood: Mildly Chaotic, Surprisingly Intricate**

---

You lean an elbow on the polished (and recently juice-free) front counter.  
Your coat still smells faintly of kiwi.  
Your back still aches from earlier *heroism*.  
But this? This is the *true* test of a warrior’s spirit.

**Paperwork.**

---

&gt; “So…” you begin, keeping your tone level, charming, casual.  
&gt; “How does one go about collecting a bounty on an ex-Warlord?”

The marine clerk doesn’t look up yet—she’s writing something that involves a lot of angry underlines.

&gt; “Are you asking for legal or ethical reasons?”

You cough.

&gt; “Uh. Financial?”

---

She sighs, then finally looks up and adjusts her glasses.

&gt; “That’s a complicated one.”

She opens a drawer and pulls out a thick, coffee-stained folder labeled: **BOUNTY ELIGIBILITY DISPUTES: POST-WARLORD STATUS**  
Inside? You see *dozens* of case summaries, cross-claims, and handwritten addendums marked **PENDING**.

---

&gt; “Okay,” she begins, in a tone that says *you’re going to regret asking*,  
&gt; “Bounty eligibility on revoked Warlords depends on several factors:”

---

She ticks off her fingers:

**“One.”**  
&gt; “Did the individual have a government-issued bounty prior to, or after, their Warlord status was revoked?”

**“Two.”**  
&gt; “Were they apprehended or defeated in a recognized anti-criminal operation?”  
&gt; “If Marines were involved, claims often default to Marine oversight.”

**“Three.”**  
&gt; “Was the contribution to the defeat **measurable, significant, and direct**?”

She gives you a once-over, eyes lingering on the juice stains on your coat.

&gt; “You look like you did something weird. So maybe.”

---

You raise a tentative hand.

&gt; “Uh… what if it was more like…”

&gt; “...A *giant fruit elemental* did most of the heavy lifting while I lay unconscious in a public square?”

She pauses. Pen hovers mid-air.

&gt; “...Like a summoned creature?”

You nod.

She scribbles something.

&gt; “*Possible 'Proxy Combatant Clause' Invocation.*”

---

&gt; “Also,” you add, “he was also being punched by a pirate and fisted by a marine at the time. Like, simultaneously.”

She doesn’t even blink.

&gt; “Then you’ll want subsection 4.3: *‘Shared Contribution in Mixed Criminal-Justice Action Events.’*”

---

You blink.

&gt; “...Does that cancel the bounty?”

She shrugs.

&gt; “Not always. Sometimes it just *splits* it.”

&gt; “If Smoker files a claim, it becomes Marine property. If Straw Hat Luffy files one, it might be rejected since he’s a pirate. If **neither** files, and you get there first…”

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “Well. You *might* get a cut.”

---

&gt; “How much of a cut?”

She slams down a stack of fine print marked:  
**‘UP TO X BERRI’ DOES NOT GUARANTEE X BERRI’**

&gt; “Ever hear of *processing fees, maritime deduction taxes,* and *payout delay clauses*?”

---

You slowly step back from the counter.

She pats the folder.

&gt; “But hey. If you really want to file… we can start your paperwork now.”

&gt; “Estimated processing time is…”  
She flips a page.

&gt; “...14 to 18 months. Assuming you survive the first audit.”

---

**OOC:**
You now understand that collecting on **Crocodile’s bounty** is:

- *Technically possible*
- *Incredibly bureaucratic*
- *Likely to be contested*
- *May end in you receiving a novelty check for 7,000 Berri and a coupon for a free government-issue protein bar*

Would you like to:

1. {File the bounty claim anyway. It’s the principle of the thing.}  
2. {Decline to file, and maybe try to cash in some palace goodwill later instead.}  
3. {Ask about registering your fruit officially with the World Government (a risky move).}  
4. {Ask to see Smoker, if he’s present.}

The clerk narrows her eyes, lips quirking into something between amusement and pity.

&gt; “You sure?”

You pause.

Then—like a man about to open **Pandora’s Filing Cabinet**—you nod solemnly.

&gt; “Just… show me how much paperwork we’re talking about.”

---

She reaches beneath the desk, opens a deep drawer, and with the dramatic flair of someone who’s seen *too many idealists perish at the hands of bureaucracy*, pulls out a **stack of forms**.

Not one folder.

Not two.

**Six.**

Each a different color.  
Each bearing a different set of seals, acronyms, and terrifyingly vague footnotes.

---

She slaps them down, one by one:

---

1. **Form W-BT-004** – *Revocation Adjustment Confirmation*  
&gt; “Verifies that the bounty remained active during revocation transition.”

2. **Form M-JT-872** – *Marine Joint Engagement Clause*  
&gt; “Outlines how many Marines were present, their contributions, and why they didn’t get the kill first.”

3. **Form C-XP-666** – *Civilian Proxy Combatant Declaration*  
&gt; “You sign this, you declare yourself ‘primarily responsible’ for any and all juice-related damages in a 10-mile radius.”

4. **Form P-KI-399** – *Paramecia-Based Summon Proxy Filing*  
&gt; “Covers entities born of fruit-based consciousness that act on the user’s behalf.”  
&gt; (Scrawled on the top: *DOES NOT APPLY TO WHIPPED CREAM OR JAM-TYPE ABILITIES*)

5. **Form B-REV-404** – *Bounty Revenue Share Petition*  
&gt; “Used to request payment from multiple parties' shared defeat. Must include *witness testimony,* medical reports, and fruit residue samples.”

6. **Form X-VOID-UNL** – *World Government Exception Liability Waiver*  
&gt; “In case the claim is rejected and you want to avoid being fined for impersonating a bounty hunter with insufficient credentials.”

---

She finishes the display with a flourish.

Then slowly pushes a pen across the desk.

&gt; “Page count comes to around… two hundred and seventy-six. Including appendices.”

&gt; “Ink not included.”

---

You stare at it.

You stare at her.

You stare at the pen.

---

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “Still want to file, Sensei?”

---

**OOC: Final Decision Time –**

Do you:

1. {Take the forms. The pain will be real—but so is the possibility of payoff, even if symbolic.}  
2. {Back away slowly. “On second thought, I’ll just stick to government-funded housing and palace tea.”}  
3. {Grab just one form—*maybe* the Paramecia declaration—for curiosity’s sake.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - ...is there a deadline on filing? I can try filling out... A page a night?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Marine Field Office – Welcome to the Grind]**  
**Scene: “The Paper Path to Glory”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Committed | Mood: Mundane Heroism, Humor Meets Dread**

---

You eye the mountain of forms.  
It eyes you back.

Two hundred and seventy-six pages.  
Ink not included.  
Your soul? *Probably optional.*

---

&gt; “...Is there a deadline on filing?” you ask, voice quiet like a man asking a doctor how many weeks he has left.

The clerk taps the top form, **Form W-BT-004**, with a perfectly manicured nail.

&gt; “One month from the date of Warlord revocation to file your initial intent.”

&gt; “Three months to submit full documentation.”

&gt; “Or, y’know, until someone else claims they beat Crocodile first and wins the rights to bragging and whatever’s left of his buried fortune.”

---

You squint.

&gt; “That *sounds* like enough time…”

&gt; “If I fill out… one page a night?”

You pause.

&gt; “Two if I skip dinner.”

She shrugs.

&gt; “The Marines call it *‘earning your retirement with carpal tunnel.’*”

---

She hands you a folder.

No ceremony. No music. Just **the weight of your own optimism** in slightly damp, government-issued parchment.

&gt; “Take it home, Sensei.”

&gt; “And don’t forget: ink must be **blue.** Black is for Marines. Red is for war crimes.”

---

You hold the forms like they might bite.

Behind you, a younger Marine whispers to his desk partner:

&gt; “Is that the juice guy?”

&gt; “Yeah, I think he *fought a Warlord* and now he’s filing for reimbursement like it’s laundry day.”

---

You don’t respond.

You just tuck the folder under your arm, straighten your spine—

And head back into the light of day.

Because **this** is your legacy now:

**Battle-scarred protector. Educator of youth.  
Filer of paperwork.**

---

**OOC:**
You’ve officially started the **Bounty Claim Side Quest**  
(Estimated Time to Completion: 1–3 in-game months, or 6–8 long rests of miserable scribbling)

You may now:

1. {Return to the patrol with Tashigi and Kiwi-Kop.}  
2. {Check in with Vivi—the civil council meeting has likely begun.}  
3. {Take a break. Gods know, you’ve earned it.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - I slip the papers into the bookbag slung over my shoulder.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Back Alley, Rejoining the Patrol]**  
**Scene: “Pulp and Procedure”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Balanced | Mood: Light Resolve, Rhythm Returning**

---

The papers slide smoothly into the worn bookbag at your hip—**nestling in between old lesson plans, a half-crushed emergency granola bar, and a ballpoint pen with suspiciously little ink left.** You pat the side of the bag like a parent sealing a lunchbox.

&gt; “One page a night,” you mutter.

&gt; “Two if I skip breakfast.”

Pause.

&gt; “…Three if I get fired anyway.”

---

You step back onto the sunbaked cobblestone, rounding the corner toward the alley you left behind.

There they are.

**Tashigi’s finishing the paperwork** (ironic, given your new burden), and **Kiwi-Kop stands vigilant** like a green gelatinous gargoyle—arms crossed, leaking modestly onto a stray cat, which doesn’t seem to mind.

The suspect is tied, slumped, grumbling.

&gt; “Tell your fruit slime it stepped on my dignity.”

You point to the puddle near him.

&gt; “Tell your dignity not to be so absorbent.”

---

**Tashigi straightens**, brushing dust off her sleeve. Her brow rises as you reappear, the bureaucratic stink of paperwork still faintly radiating from your coat.

&gt; “You good?”

You nod.

&gt; “Yep. Begun the noble journey of Warlord Bounty Claim Filing Protocol Section 8-B. A hero’s path.”

Tashigi rolls her eyes.

&gt; “Next thing I know you’ll be issuing citations for sidewalk slippage.”

---

**Kiwi-Kop emits a deep “bloop.”**  
It seems… supportive.

You all stand there a moment.  
The tension of the morning—gone.  
The rhythm of rebuilding—resuming.

---

You take your baton in hand.  
You adjust your bag.  
The pages rustle once as they settle into place.

---

**You’re not a warlord. Not a pirate. Not a soldier.**

You’re just **you**.

But in a city full of cracks and children and quiet danger,  
**you’re enough.**

---

**OOC: The day continues.**

Would you like to:

1. {Join the civil council with Vivi—policy, recovery, and long-term reconstruction.}  
2. {Continue patrolling with Tashigi through the refugee quarter. Rumors of unrest stir there.}  
3. {Take a moment to yourself. Explore your power more deeply—maybe test elemental variations.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - I frown at the juice dripping off Kiwi Kop, starting to flood the nearest sewer grate.

Maybe... I should try this in a more... Permeable part of town next time. I desummon the elemental.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Side Street, Dripping With Promise]**  
**Scene: “Cleanup on Aisle Kop”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Self-Aware | Mood: Reflective, Functional, Slightly Slippery**

---

You glance down at **Kiwi-Kop**, who has taken to mimicking your posture with uncanny accuracy—one squishy arm raised thoughtfully, the other leaking slightly over the top of a storm grate that’s now gurgling with concern.

A poor city maintenance worker further down the street glares at the bubbling runoff, visibly calculating the number of buckets and curse words this cleanup will take.

You wince.

&gt; “Yeah… we probably shouldn’t be letting law enforcement ooze into the plumbing.”

---

With a sigh, you focus.

A familiar tug curls behind your navel—part instinct, part exhaustion, and part resignation that *maybe* not all parts of justice are biodegradable.

You hold out your hand.

&gt; “Alright, buddy. Good shift. Time to clock out.”

---

**Kiwi-Kop emits a long, drawn-out “bloo—”**

And **dissolves.**

With a polite *plop.*

A citrus-scented splash paints the cobblestones where it stood.

A single fig seed rolls into a crack and nestles there, as if in memory.

---

Tashigi, watching from a few feet away, crosses her arms and raises a brow.

&gt; “So… fruit magic cleanup duty is part of your job now too?”

You adjust your coat, now slightly less sticky.

&gt; “Occupational hazard of being a teacher-slash-vigilante. Also, I'm pretty sure I violated at least three environmental ordinances just now.”

---

She chuckles—*actually chuckles*—and falls in beside you.

---

The sun continues rising higher.

The scent of fresh bread and market fruit wafts in from a nearby plaza.  
The echoes of rebuilding sound out from the rooftops above.

And you?

You're *still here*.

**No longer just reacting to chaos.**  
Now? You're *directing* something.

Even if it leaks.

---

**OOC: Where to next, Sensei?**

1. {Join Vivi at the palace for the civil council session. Begin long-term recovery planning.}  
2. {Continue patrol—head toward the refugee zone. Possible Baroque sympathizers have been sighted.}  
3. {Test your fruit deeper—explore new elemental variations in a private location.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - You know, I know we ended up capturing Crocodile, but what happened to his other officers? All Sunday disappeared, and we never properly apprehended the ones back at the Sandora river.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – East Wall Walkway, On Patrol]**  
**Scene: “The Unfinished Ends”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Uneasy Calm, Seeds of Future Conflict**

---

You and **Tashigi** walk along the narrow wall that overlooks Alubarna’s eastern quarter—below, rooftops stretch like plates laid out for a feast the kingdom hasn’t quite prepared for yet. Workers hammer at scaffolds, smoke coils lazily from repaired chimneys, and **hope cautiously returns to its perch**.

And yet…

**You frown.**

It’s not the rebuilding that nags at you.  
It’s the silence.

&gt; “Hey,” you murmur, lowering your voice.

&gt; “I know we captured Crocodile. Slammed him in enough citrus to pickle him for a week.”

You glance sideways at her.

&gt; “But what happened to the rest of Baroque Works?”

---

**Tashigi slows**, the wind tugging lightly at her coat. She doesn't answer right away.

You keep going.

&gt; “I mean… Miss All Sunday? She disappeared in the chaos.”

&gt; “Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger were still fighting Zoro and Nami last I saw—do we know if they were *actually* apprehended?”

&gt; “Mr. 2—Bon Clay—might have escaped in the confusion too.”

&gt; “And the agents at the Sandora River… Mr. 4, Miss Merry Christmas…”

You trail off.

&gt; “We *won*. But we didn’t *finish.*”

---

Tashigi nods grimly.

&gt; “We know.”

Her eyes narrow.

&gt; “Miss All Sunday hasn’t been sighted since Crocodile’s capture. It’s like she vanished with the wind.”

&gt; “Some say she was *never truly part of Baroque Works.* Just an opportunist.”

You arch a brow.

&gt; “Pretty powerful opportunist, for someone who read the Poneglyph like it was bedtime poetry.”

---

She sighs.

&gt; “As for the others…&quot;

&gt; &quot;We’ve confirmed that some of Crocodile’s officers escaped. Mr. 2’s last known appearance was on the outer edge of Alubarna, near a civilian convoy. After that—gone.”

&gt; “No bodies. No arrests. Just empty footprints in the sand.”

---

Her voice tightens—not with panic, but with something colder:

&gt; “It’s not over.”

---

You look out over the city, watching a little boy chasing a lizard with a paintbrush, laughing as he misses every swing.

&gt; “They’re going to regroup.”

Tashigi nods again.

&gt; “They’ll lie low. Regrow their masks. Build something smaller, smarter, meaner.”

She looks at you fully.

&gt; “Maybe not here. Maybe not soon. But somewhere.”

---

A pause.

&gt; “That’s why we stay.”

You nod, once.

---

**OOC: Here are the confirmed fates so far:**

- **Crocodile:** In Marine custody, imprisoned pending extradition to Impel Down.  
- **Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin):** Missing. Escaped during Crocodile's downfall.  
- **Mr. 1 &amp; Miss Doublefinger:** Fate unclear. Possibly escaped in the confusion after the rebel battle.  
- **Mr. 2 (Bon Clay):** Escaped capture. Last seen aiding civilians—may not be hostile, but unpredictable.  
- **Mr. 4 &amp; Miss Merry Christmas:** Unconfirmed. Their battle site was destroyed during the elemental eruption. Possibly buried, possibly gone.  
- **Lower Agents:** Several arrested. Many remain at large. Baroque’s network was deep.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Request access to Baroque Works dossiers to investigate their structure—maybe help track them down?}  
2. {Plan with Tashigi to form a civilian task force—trained eyes in every quarter of Alubarna.}  
3. {Let it sit for now, and move forward with your day—there's enough to handle in the present.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - I might need to need to learn how to keep Kiwi Kop active while I sleep. Wouldn't want to get my throat slit in bed by some vengeful Baroque boy or girl.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Eastern Wall, Sunset Over Sandstone]**  
**Scene: “Eyes Open While I Sleep”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Lightly Paranoid | Mood: Thoughtful, Protective, Quietly Determined**

---

You lean against the worn stone ledge, arms crossed loosely as the shadows grow long across the city. The sun dips lower, dragging Alabarna into a golden hush. It's peaceful now.

*Too* peaceful.

---

&gt; “You know,” you mutter aloud, “I might need to figure out how to keep Kiwi-Kop active while I sleep.”

Tashigi doesn’t respond immediately.  
Just tilts her head slightly.

&gt; “You expecting trouble?”

You scan the skyline.  
Watch two hawks wheel over the merchant district.  
Feel the ache in your ribs from the cannon blast that nearly turned you into pulp.  
Feel the still-fresh memory of **Baroque agents** slithering like ghosts beneath the foundation of a kingdom.

---

&gt; “I’m not *expecting* it,” you admit.  
&gt; “But I’ve seen enough to know the world doesn’t hand out happy endings.”

You exhale, slow and measured.

&gt; “Wouldn’t take much. One bitter leftover with a blade and a grudge. I’m not hard to find. Hell, I filed paperwork under my real name.”

Tashigi snorts softly.

&gt; “You’re dramatic.”

---

You turn your head slightly.

&gt; “You ever worry about it?”

She looks at you sharply.

You clarify.

&gt; “When you sleep. When you’re off-duty. That someone might try and finish the job they started?”

---

A beat.

&gt; “Every night,” she says.

---

That silence stretches again.

Not lonely.

Just honest.

---

You hold up your hand, conjuring a faint, humming orb of **juice-light**, swirling lazily in your palm like sap infused with the last breath of summer.

&gt; “I think… maybe if I keep the elemental small. Less mass. Lower drain.”

&gt; “More of a warden. A lookout.”

You glance at her.

&gt; “Think I can train it to wake me if someone tries anything?”

---

Tashigi watches the juice swirl.

&gt; “That’s not a fruit technique.”

&gt; “That’s a survival instinct.”

&gt; “And probably the most responsible damn idea I’ve heard today.”

---

She pauses, then adds, almost offhand:

&gt; “When you figure it out… show me. Might be useful for others like you.”

She hesitates.

&gt; “Like *us.*”

---

The silence after that?

Feels less haunted.

---

**OOC: You’ve unlocked a new personal goal:**

### **[Passive Summoning – Subconscious Kiwi Construct]**

&gt; You may now begin experimenting with a small, low-energy elemental variant designed for **nighttime defense and alarm detection**.

Attributes may include:
- Limited lifespan (~2–4 hours unattended)  
- Heightened sensory awareness during your unconscious state  
- “Ping” alert upon perceived threat  
- Autonomous dissolve if attacked or overtaxed

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Begin working on a prototype tonight—experiment with fruit output before sleep.}  
2. {Head back to the palace and check in with Vivi before the day ends.}  
3. {Wrap patrol, grab dinner with Tashigi, decompress. Just a little.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - You know any good kebab places? I was told of a few in Rainbase, but I never had the time to try them out. Because... Y'know.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Market District, Dusk]**  
**Scene: “Kebabs and Casualties”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Low Flame Warmth | Mood: Quiet Companionship, End-of-Day Softness**

---

&gt; “You know any good kebab places?”

Your words break the long silence as you and Tashigi descend from the wall, boots tapping against sandstone steps smoothed by generations.

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “Now?”

You give her a tired shrug, twirling your baton lazily over one shoulder.

&gt; “I was told about a few back in Rainbase, but, uh… things got *complicated*.”

&gt; “Hard to critique spice balance when someone’s trying to drop a warlord on your face.”

---

Tashigi actually snorts. It’s small, barely there, but it’s real.

&gt; “There’s a spot near the artisan quarter,” she says, motioning for you to follow as you turn down a narrow, cobbled side street. “It’s old. Family-run. Still standing even after the siege.”

&gt; “The kind of place that doesn’t *look* like much.”

She glances sideways.

&gt; “But then again… neither do you.”

---

You bow exaggeratedly, nearly tripping on a loose brick.

&gt; “I’ll pretend that was a compliment.”

---

**The alley opens up to a tucked-away stall**, half-lit by firelight and strung with makeshift lanterns. The scent hits you instantly:

**Charred lamb, sizzling spice, toasted cumin, fresh mint, and just a whisper of tangy yogurt.**

The grill sizzles behind a short man with a scar like a map across his face and a metal tong clenched in a hand that’s probably seen battle. He gives Tashigi a subtle nod—like they’ve been here before. She responds with an equally subtle lean against the ordering counter.

&gt; “The usual,” she says.

&gt; “And something for my… tag-along.”

---

&gt; “With extra garlic,” you add. “I want to repel any assassins with breath alone tonight.”

&gt; “Proactive defense.”

---

He grunts. Begins flipping meat.

A few moments pass in the comfort of glowing coals and the soft buzz of nighttime Alubarna.

Children laugh from a nearby table.  
Someone plays a lute two streets over.  
You take a seat on a tilted crate and watch Tashigi as she exhales slowly, letting the tension roll off her like steam.

---

You murmur, half-sincere:

&gt; “So is this your way of saying you care?”

She looks at you. Then hands you a wrapped skewer of blistered lamb and grilled dates.

&gt; “This is my way of not listening to you complain on an empty stomach.”

---

You both dig in.

And for a few minutes?

The world isn’t broken.

The war is over.  
The kids are safe.  
The kebabs are perfect.

And somewhere in the distance, a fig seed rolls across a cobblestone.

---

**OOC: You’ve formed a new bond with Tashigi —**  
**“Sword &amp; Citrus – A Comrade’s Comfort”**

She won’t say it aloud. But today?  
You were the right partner to have at her side.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Talk about anything deeper over the kebabs—loss, legacy, justice.}  
2. {Keep it light. Trade stories, maybe even smile.}  
3. {Just eat. In the quiet. Side by side. Let that be enough.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - So, what's your CO up to these days? Any new orders coming in from HQ? 

OOC: Smoker is leading reconstruction from the Marine side. He has also received word that he's getting a promotion to Commodore for &quot;single handedly saving Alabasta from Crocodile&quot;, as said in the news - something he's angrily trying to correct the record on. Secretly, he's also put in a request to promote Tashigi to Ensign and got it approved, something he plans to surprise her with at the next opportunity.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Artisan Quarter, Late Evening]**  
**Scene: “The Captain, The Promotion, and The Skewers”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light with Subtext | Mood: Comfortable, Friendly, Just a Touch of Warmth**

---

You’re two bites into the most absurdly well-spiced lamb skewer of your life when you tilt your head Tashigi’s way, grease on your fingers, a trace of smoke still curling from the kebab stand behind you.

&gt; “So… what’s your CO up to these days?”

You say it casually—like you’re asking about the weather. But she stiffens slightly. Not tension exactly, just… formality. Even in kebab mode.

&gt; “Any new orders coming in from HQ?”

---

Tashigi takes a moment to chew, swallows, then dabs the corner of her mouth with the inside of her glove.  
Because she’s Tashigi, and of course she does.

&gt; “Captain Smoker’s been working with palace liaisons. Coordinating reconstruction. Reestablishing jurisdiction zones. Un-burying Marine barracks that were crushed by Bananagators.”

She says the last part with a deadpan so dry it could sand a table.

---

&gt; “He hates it,” she adds after a beat. “He’s not a desk guy. Watching civilians walk past the rubble when he can’t help every single one of them—it’s eating him up.”

She glances to the side, expression tightening for a second.

&gt; “...But he’s still showing up. Every day. Without fail.”

---

You nod slowly.

&gt; “Sounds like someone I know.”

She doesn’t respond. Just takes another bite and avoids eye contact.

---

But then… a sly flicker of something glints in her eye. Something unspoken. She leans in a bit, elbow resting on the crate between you.

&gt; “Also…”

She drops her voice, almost conspiratorially:

&gt; “He’s fuming over some nonsense the *World Economy News* printed.”

You tilt your head.

&gt; “The one where they said he *single-handedly defeated Crocodile* and *saved the entire country by himself*?”

&gt; “Yeah. Saw that.”

&gt; “Did he throw the paper?”

&gt; “He threw the paper. Then lit it on fire. Then kicked it into the river.”

---

You both laugh.

It’s a little too loud for the quiet corner of the market.

You don’t apologize.

---

Tashigi shifts slightly, more relaxed now. There's something satisfied in her posture, like the burdens of command are a little lighter here, skewers in hand, no reports to write.

&gt; “He’s pretending not to know,” she says softly, “but HQ’s promoting him.”

You raise an eyebrow.

&gt; “Really? Commodore?”

She nods.

&gt; “Won’t admit it. Keeps trying to correct the record, send in rebuttals. They keep printing the same headline.”

&gt; “‘Hero of Alabasta.’”

---

You whistle.

&gt; “Think he’s gonna start carrying business cards with that on it?”

Tashigi snorts into her drink.

&gt; “Not unless the back says ‘Shut Up and Move.’”

---

A pause.

The firelight flickers.

&gt; “...He also put in a promotion request for me.”

Her voice is quieter now. Not sheepish. Just… surprised. Grateful. A little vulnerable.

&gt; “Didn’t tell me.”

&gt; “But I caught the draft before it got filed.”

You blink.

&gt; “That’s some detective work.”

She shrugs.

&gt; “Ensign’s not that big a jump.”

A pause.

&gt; “But it means he trusts me.”

---

You raise your skewer like a glass.

&gt; “To Ensign Tashigi.”

She raises hers in kind.

&gt; “To Mister Pineapple, Slayer of Crocodiles and Inventor of Non-Lethal Fruit Golems.”

---

You clink kebabs.  
It is, unquestionably, the most **Alabastan toast** imaginable.

---

**OOC: Your bond with Tashigi has deepened.**  
She’s allowing herself moments of *relaxation* around you now.  
Of vulnerability. Of human connection, outside the Marine code.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Walk her back to the palace. A quiet end to a long day.}  
2. {Head to the training fields—test your new elemental alarm idea. She might even want to spar.}  
3. {Ask her something more personal—you’ve never had a better moment.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - You know, you really know your way around with that sword of yours. We should spar sometime. Always wanted to pick up a few tricks. I gesture at my baton.

All this? Self taught. Martial art books at the local library, and a class at an old people's home about &quot;defending yourself from the less elderly.&quot; I think ended up getting a yellow belt in some art, I don't even know which, or what it means.

**Scene: “A Walk, a Wandering Blade, and the Secret Yellow Belt”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Intimate, Self-Deprecating Warmth, a Hint of Affection in the Air**

---

The market’s glow falls behind you both, replaced by the **cool hush of moonlit alleys**, the flicker of lanterns, the distant calls of guards doing their rounds. You’re walking back shoulder to shoulder, the kebabs long gone, but the sense of warmth lingering like the tang of spice on your tongue.

---

&gt; “You know,” you begin, spinning your collapsed baton lazily in one hand,  
&gt; “You really know your way around with that sword of yours.”

**Tashigi**, who’d been quietly enjoying the rare sound of peace, gives a faint side-smile.

&gt; “...That’s the nicest way anyone’s ever said ‘you nearly stabbed me the first time we met.’”

---

You smirk, lifting your hands in mock innocence.

&gt; “It’s a compliment!”

&gt; “I mean it. We should spar sometime.”

You jab your baton outward like it’s a fencing foil. It whistles through the air with… enthusiasm, if not elegance.

---

&gt; “Always wanted to pick up a few tricks.”

You pause, tapping the side of your head.

&gt; “Everything I know came from self-study. Martial arts books at the local library. And one community class at a retirement home.”

She stares.

You nod, solemn.

&gt; “Taught by a 93-year-old woman named Lady Riko. The class was called *‘Defend Yourself from the Less Elderly.’*”

---

Tashigi makes a sound—somewhere between a cough and a laugh—trying and failing to contain the grin stretching across her face.

&gt; “You’re joking.”

&gt; “I’m not.”

&gt; “...You *are.*”

&gt; “I got a yellow belt!” you declare proudly.

&gt; “...In something.”

You shrug.

&gt; “I don’t remember what. It had a very long name and some of it might’ve been misprinted.”

---

Tashigi shakes her head slowly, clearly torn between admiration and secondhand embarrassment.

&gt; “And now you’re fighting Warlords.”

You tap your temple.

&gt; “All thanks to Riko-sensei.”

&gt; “She once disarmed an armed robber using only a loaded dice set and sheer disappointment.”

---

You both laugh again.

It echoes off the walls of the city, under the stars.

---

**You reach the palace steps**, the guards nodding at your approach, familiar now with your face—even if your reputation shifts daily between *hero*, *tourist*, *walking fruit punch*, and *marine-adjacent mop wielder.*

---

Tashigi pauses before heading in.

&gt; “...We can spar.”

You blink.

&gt; “Wait, really?”

She looks at you sideways.

&gt; “Tomorrow morning. Training yard. Dawn.”

&gt; “I want to see if that yellow belt is real.”

---

You flash a grin.

&gt; “Only if you promise not to go full death-blade on me.”

She scoffs.

&gt; “No promises.”

---

She disappears through the corridor with a rustle of coat and scabbard.

You’re left on the steps a moment longer, staring out into the calm of a kingdom you helped save.

---

**OOC:**
Tomorrow morning—**sparring session unlocked**.  
Whether you learn something useful… or just get thoroughly bruised… depends on your choices.

But tonight?

Tonight, you rest.  
Kiwi juice in your blood, kebabs in your belly, and a **very confusing yellow belt legacy** tucked somewhere in your soul.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Head to your room and try to prototype your elemental alarm before sleep.}  
2. {Take a walk through the palace gardens. Perhaps you’re not the only one awake.}  
3. {Turn in early. You’ve got a duel at dawn, Sensei.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - I wonder how Vivi's day went. Wander around.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Moonlit Gardens]**  
**Scene: “Petals, Promises, and a Princess at Peace”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Serene, Soft Reflection, A Quiet Thread of Intimacy**

---

You peel away from the palace’s main hallway, choosing a quieter route—one that winds between moon-drenched stone columns and down into the **palace gardens**, where moonflowers sway open in the night air and the sound of distant fountains whispers like someone telling secrets to the breeze.

**The stone under your feet is warm from the day.**  
The scent of cactus blossoms and imported jasmine lingers just enough to soften your nerves.

---

You let your legs lead you, a mix of idle curiosity and gentle concern curling in your chest.

&gt; *Wonder how she’s doing...*

---

You turn a corner—

—and there she is.

---

**Vivi**, seated on a low marble bench beneath the canopy of a **crooked flowering date tree**, her arms wrapped around one knee, the other leg stretched long across the stone.

Her slippers are off, her royal sash discarded beside her. She wears a simple cotton wrap, pale blue and soft like the dusk sky. Her hair is loose, **ruffled by the wind**, and there’s a half-eaten fig on the tray beside her, untouched for what looks like a while.

Her eyes are closed. But her brow isn’t peaceful.

She’s thinking. Deeply.

---

You hesitate at the edge of the garden path.

She senses you anyway.

&gt; “Couldn’t sleep either?” she asks softly, eyes still closed.

---

You shuffle forward, boots quieter than they’ve ever been in your life.

&gt; “I was wondering how your day went.”

A small, tired smile curls at her lips. She opens one eye, then the other. Her voice is barely above the rustling leaves.

&gt; “Busy.”

A pause.

&gt; “Everyone wants something. A treaty signed. A road repaved. A sibling found. A father reassured.”

Another pause.

&gt; “Some people just want me to still be the girl I was before.”

She opens her eyes fully now.

&gt; “That girl doesn’t exist anymore.”

---

You lower yourself onto the far end of the bench. Not too close. But close enough.

&gt; “I think she’s still in there,” you say, after a beat. “She just has… better armor now.”

Vivi lets out a quiet, shaky laugh.

&gt; “I think she traded the armor for war paint.”

---

The garden falls into a silence again.

But it’s different from before.  
Not sad. Not strained.  
Just… two people **sharing a pause**, under stars they both nearly didn’t live to see.

---

&gt; “You staying?” she asks, not looking at you this time.

You blink.

&gt; “In the palace?”

&gt; “In Alabasta.”

You don’t answer right away.

So she glances at you, head tilted slightly, as if to say:

**‘I won’t push. But I need to know.’**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Be honest. You still don’t know—but part of you wants to.}  
2. {Say yes. Say you’re staying—at least for a while.}  
3. {Answer with a question: “Do you want me to?”}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Yeah, I was going to stay, at least until reconstruction in Alubarna is complete. (Clueless) Make sure no roofs fall on you when you're walking the town, you know 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens – Under the Date Tree]**  
**Scene: “Anchored in Citrus and Stone”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Deepening Connection, Gentle Relief**

---

You scratch the back of your neck, eyes drifting toward the moonlit trellises and the vines hanging from the old stonework like memories yet to be sorted.

&gt; “Yeah,” you say, casual. Honest. Like it's the simplest truth in the world.  
&gt; “I was going to stay.”

You glance toward her, a shrug pulling at one shoulder.

&gt; “At least until reconstruction in Alubarna’s done. Got to make sure no roofs fall on you when you’re walking through town, y’know.”

You add a slight grin at the end, trying to keep the tone light. Clueless to the weight of your words.

But **Vivi doesn’t laugh**.

Not right away.

She just… looks at you. Really looks.

---

Her eyes aren’t watery.  
They’re **clear**.  
Steady.

But there’s something in the way her hands curl lightly in her lap—  
The way her shoulders lower—  
The way her chest lifts with the first **real exhale** she’s probably taken all day.

---

&gt; “You always say things like that,” she says.

Her voice is soft.

&gt; “Like they’re nothing.”

---

You blink.

&gt; “Like what?”

She turns her head toward you, moonlight pooling in her hair like a second crown.

&gt; “Like you don’t realize how rare it is to hear them.”

---

There’s a quiet moment.

A cool breeze pushes through the trees.

Somewhere nearby, a guard yawns.  
A fox stirs near the garden wall.

But here—under this crooked date tree—it’s just you two.

---

She smiles.

Genuinely.

&gt; “Thank you.”

A pause.

Then, with more playfulness than before:

&gt; “Though if a roof does fall on me, I’m holding you personally accountable.”

You hold up a hand.

&gt; “Fair. I’ll file an apology form with the Marine Civil Engineering Department. Might take a year.”

---

The quiet laughter shared now is easier.  
No longer defensive.  
No longer tired.  
Just... soft. Real.

---

**OOC: You’ve gained another layer to your bond with Vivi –**  
**“A Rooftop Promise: An Anchor in Rebuilding”**

Where others may come and go with victory banners or headlines,  
**you stayed.**

And **she noticed.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask her how she’s really feeling—about the future, the war, her place in it all.}  
2. {Tell her goodnight, and return to your room to prepare for your dawn spar.}  
3. {Say nothing else. Just sit beside her, until the moon begins to dip.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Once it gets late enough, get up and pat her head.

Don't stay up too late, blue. You're still in your growing years, unlike me.

Head towards my room for a well deserved bath and rest.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Garden Departure]**  
**Scene: “A Pat, a Parting, and a Promise in Passing”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tender | Mood: Contentment, Quiet Caring, A Soft Night Close**

---

The minutes stretch in peaceful silence. The kind of silence only people who’ve suffered together—and chosen to heal—can share. The moon arcs gently overhead, brushing the rooftops with silver. You don’t say a word, and neither does she.

You sit beside her until the garden begins to yawn with the earliest signs of deep night.

Then, slowly, you rise.

The wooden bench creaks softly beneath your absence, and Vivi’s head turns lazily to follow your movement.

You pause, eyes on her for just a beat longer.

Then you reach out, casually—  
And rest your hand lightly atop her crown of wind-tousled hair.

She freezes.

---

&gt; “Don’t stay up too late, Blue,” you murmur, voice warm, teasing.  
&gt; “You’re still in your growing years.”

&gt; “Unlike me.”

---

She doesn't say anything.

But her head doesn’t flinch away, either.  
Her hand lifts briefly, touches your wrist in return—  
A silent *thank you*, and a quiet *stay safe* all wrapped into a moment small enough to miss if you weren't looking for it.

You don’t make it a big thing. You never do.

You just turn with a slight wave, and walk off into the palace corridors.

---

The marble floor cools beneath your boots as you move.  
Your room greets you with flickering candlelight, the scent of fresh linen, and the faint hiss of **steaming bathwater** waiting.

Your coat hits the hook.  
The bag of bounty paperwork hits the desk with a damp thump.  
And you?

You slide into the water like a man claiming his **hard-earned reward**.

---

**OOC:**
You’ve concluded your second day in post-war Alubarna.

**The city is healing.  
You are healing.  
And whether you know it or not…  
They’ve started to depend on you.**

---

**Rest Well, Sensei.  
You’ve got a duel at dawn.**

Would you like to:

1. {Sleep immediately. Wake at dawn for the spar with Tashigi.}  
2. {Take 30 minutes to experiment with your Kiwi Alarm elemental before sleep.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - place a mini kiwi elemental in the drained bathtub, letting any dripping go down the drain. Try to maintain it as I hop into bed, and slowly fall to sleep.

OOC: Extremely low odds of success

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Guest Quarters, Near Midnight]**  
**Scene: “The Watcher in the Water”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Hopeful, Experimental, Uncertain**

---

The bath’s warmth still clings to your skin, a comfort slowly giving way to exhaustion. Steam trails off the marble walls like the last sighs of the day. Your arms ache in that pleasant, lived-in way—equal parts battle fatigue and recovery. Tomorrow, you spar.

Tonight?

You try something new.

---

You pad barefoot across the tiled floor, and kneel by the **now-drained bathtub**.  
A few **trickles of kiwi juice** still cling to the porcelain from earlier, glinting softly in the candlelight. You touch your palm to the edge, pulse your focus through your fingertips.

**Slow. Gentle. Not an attack. Not a wave.**

Just… a whisper.

A request.

---

&gt; *“Be my eyes while I sleep.”*

---

The juice ripples.  
Quivers.  
Something forms—slowly.  
**A bud. A nub. A tiny shimmer of semi-cohesive form.**

The size of a coconut.

Its body is more **plop** than **soldier**, and you *immediately* know this is nowhere close to Kiwi-Kop. It lacks arms. Legs. Any real shape. It jiggles in place like flan left too long on a warm counter.

But still—  
It wobbles toward the drain, sits directly on top of it, and **doesn’t leak.**

You blink.

&gt; *It’s plugging the noise.*

Then—

**“Bloop.”**

A soft chirp.  
Barely audible.  
A little hopeful.

---

You stare.

It wobbles.

You nod, slow.

&gt; “...Good enough for a first try.”

---

You leave the bathroom door cracked open, flick off the lanterns, and crawl under the covers.

Your body sinks deep. Your eyelids hang heavy.  
Your senses flicker like the last glow of coals under a kettle.

---

And behind it all…

**A tiny bloop.  
Then silence.**

---

**OOC: Experiment Log – Night One: Subconscious Kiwi Alarm Prototype**  
&gt; **Status:** *Stable. Unintelligent. But real.*  
&gt; **Drain:** Minimal. Estimated functional time: 90 minutes

And you?

You sleep.

**End of Day 2**  
**Next: Day 3 – Dawn Sparring with Tashigi**

**Would you like to:**

1. {Begin with the sparring match next scene.}  
2. {Wake up earlier—have breakfast or check for an update from Vivi or the Marines first?}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Observe the dried patch of juice in the tub. Well, as expected, it didn't last the night.

OOC - On a scale of -100 (pure hatred) to 100 (pure love), describe my character's current relationship levels with relevant characters. -75 would be extreme dislike, 75 would be devoted friend.

**Scene: “Post-Dreams and Pre-Duels”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Lightly Reflective | Mood: Emerging Calm, A Dash of Scientific Disappointment**

---

The sun pierces through the palace curtains like a polite but insistent school bell.

You groan, roll over, and blink blearily into the glow of morning.

Your joints ache. Your mouth is dry. Your dreams were weird. Something about Snack Pack leading a parade.

And the **first thing you do**—because of course you do—is shuffle across the floor, tug open the bathroom door, and peer into the **tub**.

---

There’s no golem. No bloop.

Just a faint **stain of dried juice**, clinging to the porcelain like a failed science project and the ghost of a good idea.

You sigh.

&gt; “Well. That tracks.”

You flick the light switch.

&gt; *Flick.* *Flick.*

No movement. No chirp.  
The thing is deader than Crocodile’s ego post-defeat.

---

Still.

That was a start.

---

You towel your face, splash on water, and reach for your coat.

There’s a duel waiting.  
And breakfast.  
Possibly in that order.

---

**Relationship Levels (Current Arc Status):**

**Vivi Nefertari** – *Score: 78*  
&gt; She sees you as a protector, a peer, and someone who never demanded the spotlight. Your words and actions remind her of the best parts of her kingdom’s ideals. There's warmth in her glances now, comfort in your presence. She may not know what you are to her yet—but she trusts you deeply.

**Tashigi** – *Score: 70*  
&gt; Mutual respect forged through battle and quiet kebab-sharing. She sees you as an ally, an anchor, and—though she’d never admit it—a growing source of calm in her whirlwind life. She’s starting to view your presence as... dependable. And maybe more.

**Smoker** – *Score: 45*  
&gt; Professionally skeptical. Personally impressed. He doesn't fully understand you, but he recognizes genuine effort and a willingness to *not be useless*. He’d trust you to guard his flank in a fight… though maybe not to fill out a field report without adding drawings.

**Straw Hat Crew:**
- **Luffy** – *Score: 50*  
  Thinks you’re funny, juicy, and fun. Doesn’t know if you’re a hero or a weird fruit-dad. Trusts you anyway.
- **Zoro** – *Score: 25*  
  Barely acknowledges you unless you’re holding a weapon. Hasn’t decided if you’re worth remembering.
- **Nami** – *Score: 40*  
  Grateful you didn’t turn them in. Especially grateful you didn’t try to collect their bounties. Has a running tally of how many times you’ve played “hero” without charging anyone.
- **Usopp / Chopper / Sanji** – *Score: 60 (Group Avg.)*  
  They think you’re either cool or hilarious. Sanji isn’t quite sure what to make of your proximity to Vivi.
- **Robin** – *Unknown*  
  Her status as Miss All Sunday remains a thread dangling in the wind.

**King Cobra** – *Score: 55*  
&gt; Finds you honorable, if extremely bizarre. Deeply respects your promise to “Blue.” Still unsure if the *baton thwack* was bravery, foolishness, or both.

**Rain Dinners Hotel Management** – *Score: -87*  
&gt; You will **not** be receiving a security deposit refund. They *may* have filed a property destruction claim.

**Would you like to:**

1. {Head down for breakfast. You may run into Vivi, Cobra, or Smoker.}  
2. {Stretch and prep for your sparring match. Tashigi’s probably already there.}  
3. {Detour to check any mail or messages left for you overnight.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - head to the mail room in the palace. I wonder if they folks back home processed my resignation yet. Or heard the rumors in the tabloids about my alleged heroics (that teacher from our local school did what?!)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Mail Room, Morning]**  
**Scene: “Letters, Leaves, and the Legend of That One Teacher”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Curious, Slightly Dreadful | Mood: Light-Hearted, Homebound Nostalgia**

---

The palace mail room is surprisingly modest for a royal estate—just a long counter, several cubbies sorted by department and status, and a sleepy postmaster flipping through dispatches while sipping cactus coffee thick enough to coat a spoon in rebellion.

---

You step up, clearing your throat.

The postmaster peers at you over the rim of his mug.

&gt; “You the fruit-slinger from guest room 2B?”

You sigh.

&gt; “That’s me.”

He grunts and hands you a surprisingly **thick bundle** of letters and scrolls tied up with twine and juice-proof wax.

---

You step off to the side and start going through them, sorting into two piles: **“Important”** and **“Cringe.”**

---

### LETTER 1: From Your School Administration  
**Red envelope. Official wax seal. Principal Okada’s handwriting.**

&gt; “Dear Mr. Cheng,  
&gt; We received your resignation letter. We would like to inform you that:  
&gt; - You are still considered *on extended leave* pending review.  
&gt; - Your absence during school break is not considered misconduct, assuming you’re still alive.  
&gt; - Please confirm you are, in fact, still alive.  
&gt; - If you have not been eaten by pirates, please respond with proof of survival and intent.  
&gt; - Your chalk drawer has been repurposed.”  

**PS: “One of the students saw your face in the World Economy News. Please advise if this is a hoax.”**

---

### LETTER 2: From One of Your Students  
**Lined paper. Crayon drawings. Signed “Masato.”**

&gt; “Sensei!! Are you a pirate now??  
&gt; Did you beat up Crocodile?? My big brother said you used fruit to make a dinosaur made of goo!!!  
&gt; Is that true??  
&gt; Also, did you ride a duck?? Can I see a duck??  
&gt; Please write back. School is boring with Mr. Ichikawa. He smells like eggs.  
&gt; - Masato”  

(Drawing included: You holding a sword bigger than Tashigi’s, riding a dragon labeled “Snackpak.”)

---

### LETTER 3: From the Tabloid Clipping Service  
**Stamped: ‘EXPEDITED – HERO RECOGNITION DIVISION’**

An enclosed clipping from the World Economy News:  
&gt; **“Teacher or Terror? The Kiwi Knight of Alabasta!”**  
&gt; “Eyewitnesses claim the previously unknown Eatone Cheng—listed as a *part-time bounty hunter* and *full-time substitute teacher*—engaged Warlord Crocodile using mysterious fruit-based summons!”  
&gt; “Government officials have not confirmed whether this man will be recruited by the Marines or charged with the destruction of luxury property across Rainbase.”  

(Two photos: One of you collapsed in Vivi’s lap; another, a poorly rendered artist depiction of you riding your own juice elemental like a rodeo champion.)

---

You exhale.

You run your hand through your hair.

You consider going back to bed.

---

But in truth… it’s a little heartening.

They haven’t forgotten you.  
They’re waiting.  
And Masato wants to meet a duck.

---

**OOC: You now have three actionable items:**

1. **Reply to the school.** Confirm your safety and future intentions.  
2. **Write back to your student.** Maybe include a sketch or story.  
3. **Send a rebuttal to the tabloids.** Or lean into it. Maybe start charging autograph fees?

---

Would you like to:

1. {Quickly respond to one or more letters before your sparring match.}  
2. {Tuck them away for later and head toward the training yard.}  
3. {Show the letters to Vivi or Tashigi—maybe the drawing of “Snackpak.”}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 / 3 - 
To the school: Thank you for the extended leave status. I plan to stay in Alubarna to assist with reconstruction in Alabasta. The WEF article is unfortunately, mostly true.
To the student: It wasn't a dinosaur, but it sure looked felt like one. Your teacher fought a big bad pirate to save a princess. I'll come visit sometime with souvenirs. Place a royal palace postcard and local snacks in the envelope.

 Mail off the two letters.

Head to the guard's barracks, where the sparring field, and Tashigi, awaits. I keep the letters that I read tucked under my arm.

OOC: Vivi may have caught wind of the spar 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Guard Barracks Training Yard, Morning]**  
**Scene: “Steel and Citrus at Sunrise”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Calm to Focused | Mood: Playful Anticipation, Growing Discipline**

---

With your **letters sealed and stamped**, your conscience lighter and your soul slightly stickier from fame, you head down the corridor, passing early morning palace staff and the occasional duck trooper getting lost on the third floor again.

The two letters rest neatly beneath your arm.  
The postcard sticks out with a little cactus stamp and a tiny smiley face you don’t remember drawing.

---

As you round the long exterior walkway leading toward the **guard barracks**, the crisp air hits your face—morning sun glinting off the polished clay tiles of the **sparring yard**, where guards train in tight, disciplined formations.

But today?

**A different audience waits.**

---

**Tashigi is already there**, standing beneath the shade of a training arch, **coat draped neatly over a post**, white undershirt tucked into belted trousers, **sword already unsheathed and gleaming**.

She’s **stretching. Calm. Focused. Controlled.**

But you know her well enough now to notice the twitch of her jaw as she spots you.

&gt; “Took you long enough.”

---

You lift your hands defensively.

&gt; “Had a post office emergency. Hero stuff. Autographs. International mail.”

You slide the letters into your coat pocket, give your baton a lazy twirl, and take your spot on the sand-dusted sparring circle.

---

Just beyond the edge of the training wall, **a quiet observer peeks through** a lattice screen.

**Blue hair. Curious gaze.**

Vivi doesn’t speak, but she watches.

**Quietly rooting.**

---

Tashigi adjusts her grip.

&gt; “No powers,” she says simply. “No summons. Just baton versus blade.”

You blink.

&gt; “But my entire fighting style is based around improvisation, cowardice, and mildly sticky distractions.”

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “That’s a no, then?”

---

You grin.  
Extend your baton with a *snap*.

&gt; “Alright, alright. Let’s see how much Lady Riko’s yellow belt has held up.”

---

**OOC: Sparring Match Initiated!**

This is a friendly match, with minimal risk of injury—but your **dexterity, reaction time**, and **creative use of basic baton skills** will all factor into performance.

No Devil Fruit powers.  
No elementals.  
Just **grit**, **timing**, and possibly **screaming like a gym teacher being chased by geese**.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Go aggressive out the gate. Press her hard, see if you can catch her off guard.}  
2. {Start defensive—observe, adapt, and wait for an opening.}  
3. {Talk during the fight. Distract her. Ask personal questions mid-combat, teacher-style.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - I don't know the full extent of her skills, just that she's good. Maybe not as sharp as the that green haired kid, but she's up there.

OOC: Combat rolls should be catastrophically weighted against me

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Training Yard – Sparring Circle]**  
**Scene: “Clash of Steel and Substitute”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Focused | Mood: Tactical, Doomed (But With Dignity)**

---

You grip your baton—not extended, not flared, just solid—and keep your stance **light, knees bent**, the way those half-faded library books always said to.

Across from you, **Tashigi’s sword dips**, just slightly—**the opening feint of a swordswoman who doesn’t need to win, but can’t *not* fight seriously.**

---

You take a breath.

&gt; *Observe. Read. Adapt.*

You may be outmatched—but you’re a teacher.

You know how to **watch**.

---

**Combat Roll (Defense-Focused)**
- Tashigi: (1d20+8) → **17 + 8 = 25**
- You: (1d20+2) → **4 + 2 = 6**

---

**The first strike is fast.**

**Too fast.**

You *barely* see the blade move—her bokken whips through the air and cracks **clean across your extended baton**, sending a jolt through your arms that rattles your teeth and unbalances your stance.

Your counter comes too slow—she sidesteps, spins, and **taps you once on the shoulder**, then flicks your calf on the follow-through.

---

&gt; “Point,” she says. Crisp. Focused.

You stumble back into your stance, blinking.

&gt; “Okay, okay—didn’t think you were gonna go full demo reel from the start.”

---

She exhales slowly.

&gt; “You told me you wanted to learn.”

---

**Second Exchange – You Adjust**

You lower your center of gravity, adjust your grip.

She circles, testing.

You sidestep one lunge, then barely dodge a sweeping horizontal slash—her form textbook, **almost too clean** to counter.

&gt; *She fights like she’s always being judged.*

---

**Combat Roll (Adaptation Attempt)**
- Tashigi: (1d20+7) → **14 + 7 = 21**
- You: (1d20+3) → **11 + 3 = 14**

---

You manage to block two strikes—not gracefully, but with **tenacity**. She nods once, approving.

But when you go for a counter, you’re just half a beat slow—her sword taps your hand, *pop*, then your knee, *tap*, and with a half-spin she brings the wooden blade up just under your chin.

She doesn’t swing.

She just holds it there.

---

&gt; “Point.”

She lowers it gently.

&gt; “And you’d be dead.”

---

You huff.

&gt; “Not if I threw juice in your eyes.”

She smirks. Doesn't disagree.

---

**A few meters away, Vivi winces sympathetically… and then scribbles something down in a notebook.**  
(She might be rating you. She might be doodling Snack Pack again.)

---

You ready yourself.

Tashigi lifts her blade again.

There’s no mockery in her expression.  
No ego.

Only respect.

Because even if you’re **getting your arse handed to you**, you’re **not giving up**.

And that?

Counts for more than points.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Attempt one big surprise maneuver—something creative, chaotic, possibly humiliating.}  
2. {Shift to a purely evasive style—see how long you can survive.}  
3. {Call it here, respectfully. Ask for critique—after all, you’re here to learn.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - Maybe I need faster footwork 

OOC: combat rolls remain catastrophically against me, likely for the entirety of the whole spar

**Scene: “The Art of Not Dying (Immediately)”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Scrappy | Mood: Dogged, Determined, Mostly Dignified**

---

You adjust your stance.

Not lower. Not tighter.  
**Looser. Lighter. Ready to move.**

If you can’t win, **maybe you can last.**

&gt; “Alright,” you mutter, adjusting your footing in the sand.  
&gt; “Let’s see how long I can run from judgment.”

---

Tashigi narrows her eyes.

&gt; “You’re not planning to fight?”

You grin.

&gt; “I’m planning to survive. Different martial art.”

---

She exhales. And lunges.

---

**Combat Roll – Evasion Mode Activated**  
- Tashigi: (1d20+8) → **19 + 8 = 27**  
- You: (1d20+4) → **7 + 4 = 11**

---

**First pass:**

You dodge left.  
She’s already there.

Her bokken taps your side *twice*, then your shoulder as you pivot away.

You roll, and sand fills your collar.  
A move so ungraceful it loops back into respectable.

---

&gt; “Point,” she says.

You grunt.

&gt; “Warmup round.”

---

**Second pass:**

You sprint.

Not toward her—*around* her.  
Wide circles. Kicking up sand.

She watches, amused.

Then?

She darts in like a hawk.

---

**Combat Roll – Endurance Attempt**
- Tashigi: (1d20+6) → **13 + 6 = 19**
- You: (1d20+4) → **13 + 4 = 17**

---

This time, you *barely* escape the first two strikes.  
You duck one.  
Trip over your own coat.

*BUT YOU RECOVER.*

Your baton swipes wildly—accidentally deflecting her blade with a **loud CLACK**, purely from falling sideways.

---

Tashigi halts, blinking.  
Not hurt. Just stunned.

&gt; “...Did you just parry by collapsing?”

You pant.

&gt; “Advanced technique. Taught to me by Lady Riko-sensei in the ‘Avoid the Hip Fracture’ kata.”

---

A laugh.  
Short. Sharp.  
But real.

Tashigi steps back, sword down.

&gt; “You’re a disaster.”

You lean on your baton.

&gt; “I am a **resilient** disaster.”

---

**Off to the side, Vivi applauds softly.**  
Like a parent watching a kindergartener dodge their first punch.

You give a little bow.  
Fall over slightly mid-bow.

Recover. Dignity intact (mostly).

---

**OOC: You did not win. Not even close.  
But you earned her respect. And the audience’s.**

Sometimes surviving long enough to get hit *less* is still a win.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Call it here and ask for pointers. A real student moment.}  
2. {Suggest another round—with some very minor fruit assistance, maybe?}  
3. {Collapse dramatically and ask for water and possibly a medal.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Genuinely compliment Tashigi's skills 
I look over at the wall at Vivi. You enjoy watching Marine brutality, blue?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Training Yard – Post-Sparring Cooldown]**  
**Scene: “Sword, Sweat, and Sincere Words”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Respectful | Mood: Mutual Admiration, Playful Recovery**

---

You drop to one knee—half to catch your breath, half because the last spin move you attempted pulled a muscle that hasn’t been named in medical literature yet.

You look up at Tashigi, still holding her practice blade in a loose grip, posture clean, hair only *slightly* mussed.

&gt; “You’re good.”

You mean it. There’s no cheek, no sarcasm.  
Just quiet honesty, with a wheeze of effort.

&gt; “Like, *really* good. The kind of good that makes me glad we’re on the same side of the warlord-chopping equation.”

---

Tashigi’s brow lifts slightly.

&gt; “You’re not so bad yourself,” she replies.

Then smirks.

&gt; “I’ve never seen someone dodge with such… commitment to panic.”

You grin, shaking out your wrist.

&gt; “Panic is a valid martial art.”

---

You tilt your head toward the wall where **Vivi’s blue hair peeks out like a spy in training**, her notebook now closed, her expression unreadable—but her amusement **palpable**.

You raise your voice just enough to carry.

&gt; “You enjoy watching Marine brutality, Blue?”

Her head pokes out further.  
She does not look even remotely sorry.

&gt; “Only when it’s well-earned,” she says with a laugh.  
&gt; “Besides—watching you get *absolutely demolished* was oddly therapeutic.”

---

You fake a wounded gasp.

&gt; “You hear that, Tashigi-chan? No appreciation for finesse. Not even for my advanced defensive rolling technique.”

&gt; “I call it the Juicy Evasion Spiral.”

---

Tashigi walks over, offers you a hand.

You take it—only a little sore—and she hauls you to your feet.

&gt; “Same time next week?” she asks.

You dust yourself off.

&gt; “Sure. And maybe next time, I’ll last more than… what was that, five minutes?”

She considers.

&gt; “Six. If we count the collapse.”

You sigh.

&gt; “I’ll take it.”

---

**OOC:**

- Tashigi’s respect for you has **ticked up** slightly. Not because you fought well—but because you *wanted to learn*.  
- Vivi has now seen you get beaten into the sand and still crack jokes. That matters to her more than heroics ever did.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Walk with Tashigi to breakfast—perhaps Vivi joins.}  
2. {Check in with Smoker. He may have an errand or update for you.}  
3. {Head to the gardens for a breath of quiet, after all that rolling.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - show them the letters. From school, students, and tabloids.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Corridor to the Breakfast Hall]**  
**Scene: “Letters, Laughter, and a Lap of Fame”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Wholesome | Mood: Light, Heartfelt, Connected**

---

Your legs are still twitching with phantom pain from the Tashigi Special (™), but at least you're upright and on your way to breakfast—with two of the strongest-willed women you’ve ever met flanking you like bodyguards who just so happen to also sass you into humility.

You rummage through your coat and pull out the **letters**, thumbing the edges thoughtfully.

&gt; “Hey,” you say, holding them up. “Wanna see something funny?”

Tashigi looks over, mildly suspicious.

Vivi glances back with curiosity already blooming in her expression.

---

You hold up the first—**Principal Okada’s Letter**.

&gt; “This one’s from my school. They think I’m on… *extended leave.*”

You clear your throat.

&gt; “Quote: ‘Please confirm you are, in fact, still alive.’”

Tashigi nearly snorts her tea. Vivi chokes down a laugh behind a hand.

---

You tap the second letter, then hand it over to Vivi with exaggerated care.

&gt; “This one’s from a student. Kid named Masato. Very serious. Very academic.”

They both lean in, reading the crayon-scrawled message:

&gt; _“Sensei! Are you a pirate now?? Did you beat up Crocodile??”_

And then the drawing.  
Of you.  
Holding a sword the size of the palace tower.  
Riding a poorly drawn gator with a mustache and labeled “Snackpak.”

---

Vivi bursts into laughter, clutching the drawing.

&gt; “You *have* to frame this!”

Tashigi leans over her shoulder.

&gt; “It’s disturbingly accurate.”

&gt; “I never wore that many belts,” you mutter.

---

And finally—the **tabloid clipping**.

You flash it with mock pride:

&gt; **“The Kiwi Knight of Alabasta!”**  
&gt; “Hero of the People or Just Mildly Sticky Menace?”

Vivi covers her mouth, shoulders shaking.  
Tashigi flat-out laughs, her usually reserved demeanor cracking like a dropped teacup.

---

&gt; “Mildly sticky menace,” she repeats under her breath.

&gt; “That’s going on your gravestone,” Vivi adds.

---

You grin as you tuck the letters back into your coat.

&gt; “Y’know… I was worried they’d just move on without me. But it’s kind of nice, knowing someone out there’s still paying attention. Even if it’s just a student with wild artistic delusions.”

---

Tashigi’s smile softens.

&gt; “They’re proud. That much is clear.”

Vivi nods, eyes thoughtful.

&gt; “It means they still see the teacher. Even after everything.”

---

You pause, that weight settling in your chest again.  
Not heavy. Just… **real**.

---

You walk on together, laughter lingering like perfume in the corridor.  
And for the first time in a while, the path ahead feels a little less uncertain.

---

**OOC: Your bond with both Vivi and Tashigi has deepened through shared vulnerability and laughter.**  
**They see not just the man who stood beside them—but the one who still belongs to the world beyond war.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Join them for breakfast. See if Cobra or Smoker drops in.}  
2. {Sit with Vivi privately, maybe share more from your life.}  
3. {Offer to train a new palace guard recruit team with Tashigi today.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Head to the dining hall. I'll drop my response letters at the post office later

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Royal Dining Hall, Morning of Day 3]**  
**Scene: “Breakfast of Survivors”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Comforting | Mood: Familiar, Light-Bonded Banter**

---

The palace doors part as the three of you enter together, and you’re hit with the warm aroma of **spiced eggs, grilled cactus blossoms, and fresh flatbreads** stacked high beside bowls of minty yogurt and sweet melon slices.

You half expect trumpets and a scroll announcing *“Now Entering: The Sticky Defender of the People”*—but thankfully, **no fanfare.** Just the **clink of cutlery**, the **low murmur of guards and aides**, and the gentle hum of **a kingdom trying to return to normal**.

---

**King Cobra** is already seated, robe loosely tied, sipping something thick and caffeinated.  
He raises an eyebrow as your trio enters.

&gt; “Good morning,” he rumbles. “I see the morning spar didn’t kill you.”

You salute lazily.

&gt; “The secret is to collapse early and often. Builds morale.”

---

Tashigi smirks. Vivi rolls her eyes, already moving to take her usual spot at her father’s right.

You… awkwardly hover.

Until Cobra gestures to the seat across from him.

&gt; “Sit. Before I assign you as the royal mop again.”

---

You oblige.

---

**Moments later, Smoker arrives**, trailing a mild cloud of steam behind him, a large scar freshly bandaged near his left temple. He gives you a long, flat look.

&gt; “Still alive, huh?”

&gt; “Define ‘alive,’” you reply, through a mouthful of grilled onion.

He grunts. Takes the seat next to Tashigi.

---

For a while, **breakfast proceeds like a quiet little miracle**:

- **Smoker and Cobra** discuss **marine coordination and civil rebuilds**, though Smoker continues trying to correct the tabloids about his “solo heroism.”
- **Tashigi keeps glancing at you** like she might ask for a rematch at any moment.
- **Vivi passes you a bowl of fruit**, pointedly sliding the kiwi slices to your side.
- You share a few more **letters** for their amusement, including one from the school cafeteria lady who threatens to pickle your kneecaps if you don't return her missing ladle.

---

And somewhere in between mouthfuls and mirth—

You feel it.

That **thread of belonging**.  
A subtle, warm undercurrent.

You’re not just a tourist anymore.  
Not just a “sticky menace.”  
You’re **a thread in the tapestry** now.

---

**OOC: Scene Concludes**  
You’ve gained:

- **+5 Relationship (All):** Shared meal, comfort, humor.  
- **+1 Reputation (Palace Staff):** Known as “That Guy Who Fought a Warlord and Eats a Lot of Melon.”  
- **Inventory Note:** You still have your response letters, tucked in coat. Ready to mail post-breakfast.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Speak privately with Cobra after breakfast about more permanent residency.}  
2. {Return to town with Tashigi to continue patrols.}  
3. {Spend some of the morning with Vivi before the next wave of royal duties takes her.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - I really want to confirm my residency status, and make sure I'm registered in the tax system. Also that if I have an official job title or a salary (to pay taxes on). I don't want to be a mooch forever, after all.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Cobra’s Study, Midmorning]**  
**Scene: “Papers, Position, and Paying It Forward”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Responsible | Mood: Sincere, Light Bureaucratic Comedy**

---

Breakfast ends on a warm note—plates cleared, laughter shared, guards trying not to openly giggle at Vivi’s dramatic reading of your school cafeteria lady’s ladle ultimatum.

But you’ve got things to handle.

**Grown-up things.**

---

You quietly pull **King Cobra** aside just as he’s rising from his chair, still loosening the belt of his robe like a man who longs for the sweet embrace of a post-breakfast nap.

&gt; “Your Majesty, I was hoping we could… talk briefly? Something I’ve been meaning to get squared away.”

---

He gives you a long, side-eyed glance.

&gt; “Is this about the baton thing again?”

&gt; “No, no, we’re good on the kneecap front.”

&gt; “Good,” he says dryly. “They still ache.”

---

**Moments later—**  
You're in **Cobra's study**, a comfortably dusty room of dark wood and old tomes, the **air perfumed with ink, desert parchment, and sun-baked nostalgia.**

He gestures toward a long desk with various forms already laid out—he may be a king, but he clearly also doubles as the Kingdom's HR department when necessary.

You awkwardly clear your throat.

---

&gt; “So... I’m staying. At least for a while. Maybe longer.”

Cobra leans on the desk, lacing his fingers.

&gt; “Good.”

You blink.

&gt; “Wait, that’s it?”

&gt; “You saved my daughter’s life, my country’s capital, and quite possibly a few future monarchs that haven’t even been born yet. If you want to settle here, *you* tell *me* what you need.”

---

You fumble for your notes.

&gt; “Right—well, for starters: I'd like to register for **permanent residency**. I’d also like to be listed in the **tax system**—wouldn’t want to be labeled a mooch.”

Cobra raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “You… *want* to pay taxes?”

You nod solemnly.

&gt; “With great civic benefit comes great fiscal responsibility.”

---

He stares at you for a beat too long.

Then slowly pulls a form from a drawer.

&gt; “This one’s for **residency status**. Includes optional medical coverage, palace contractor benefits, and local access to kebab subsidies.”

&gt; “Oh, and this one’s the **employment affidavit**. We don’t exactly have a checkbox for ‘fruit-based freelance hero’—but I can write in something like *‘Royal Reconstruction Consultant.’*”

You blink again.

&gt; “That’s... an actual job title?”

&gt; “With salary,” Cobra nods. “Standard for civic advisors and post-crisis morale liaisons.”

&gt; “With taxes,” he adds, amused.

---

You take the pen with reverence.

&gt; “I never thought signing a W-2 could feel so victorious.”

---

**OOC: Administrative Victory Achieved!**  
You are now officially a **resident of Alubarna**, listed in the **Royal Tax &amp; Census Registry** as a:

&gt; **Royal Reconstruction Consultant (Provisional)**  
&gt; Status: Civic Morale Liaison / Bounty Risk Triage Specialist  
&gt; Compensation: Modest salary, subsidized housing (if needed), free kebab stand access on weekends.  

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Visit the palace clerk to submit the forms, then return to Tashigi.}  
2. {Swing by Vivi’s office with your new official ID—perhaps show off a little.}  
3. {Take a stroll through the capital to let it all sink in.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - Hey! Guess who got promoted from royal bum!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Ministerial Wing, Vivi’s Office]**  
**Scene: “Paperwork and Promotion Bragging Rights”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Playful | Mood: Earnest, Lighthearted Pride**

---

The **ministerial wing** of the palace is a very different flavor of regal—quieter, all **hushed sandal steps on polished stone**, interrupted only by the shuffling of papers, the scratching of pens, and the occasional nervous squeak of a junior scribe trying not to spill tea on century-old maps.

---

You wind through the corridors, forms neatly tucked under one arm and your new **Royal Reconstruction Consultant badge** glinting faintly on your chest—**laminated**, **official**, and **probably sticky-proof.**

You pass a guard who gives you a curious once-over.

You give him the slow nod of a man with taxpayer status and kebab rights.

---

**Vivi’s door is open.**  
She’s seated at a wide desk piled with more documents than one human should be expected to process in a lifetime.  
Her pen’s in motion. Her brow’s furrowed.

And when she hears your knock, she looks up with a tired smile.

&gt; “Hey. What’s up?”

You strike a pose.

Hands on hips. Badge prominently displayed.

&gt; “Guess who just got promoted from royal bum to official palace staff.”

---

She tilts her head.

Eyes dart to your badge.

Then back to you.

&gt; “...Royal Reconstruction Consultant?”

You grin.

&gt; “With kebab access. On weekends.”

---

She laughs. It’s short, but genuine.

Then rises, walks over, and gives your badge a little tap.

&gt; “So you’re official now, huh?”

&gt; “Fully certified. Might even pay taxes someday.”

&gt; “Now you’re just showing off.”

You shrug.

&gt; “Civic pride.”

---

She pauses, expression softening.

&gt; “I’m glad you’re staying.”

There’s no teasing in her tone now. Just truth.

&gt; “We need people like you.”

---

You blink, a bit caught off guard.

&gt; “You mean mildly injured, legally employed part-time fruit guys?”

&gt; “Exactly those.”

---

She returns to her desk, pulling out a small, slim folder from a drawer.  
The royal seal on the front is newer—drafted within the last day or two.

&gt; “Since you’re official now…” she says, placing it in your hands,  
&gt; “I had this drawn up.”

Inside is a **welcome packet**.  
Complete with:

- Your **official citizen code**  
- A map of **preferred vendor kebab stalls**  
- And—adorably—a **handwritten note** at the bottom:

&gt; “Your school’s lucky to have had you.  
&gt; Alubarna is luckier now.”

---

You stand there a moment too long.

Trying to figure out where to file that feeling in your heart.

Eventually you just nod, tuck the folder into your coat, and grin like a student who just passed a pop quiz without studying.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Invite Vivi for a walk through the market—you’re technically on duty now.}  
2. {Return to Tashigi and Smoker to report your change in status.}  
3. {Take the rest of the day slow. Find a rooftop. Watch the city.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - Good luck with the paperwork, blue. Let me know if you need any pointers, I'm an expert at it.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Returning to the Marines]**  
**Scene: “Paper Cuts and Promotions”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Professional Pride, Teasing Warmth**

---

&gt; “Good luck with the paperwork, Blue,” you say, slipping the folder into your coat and tossing her a little salute.  
&gt; “Let me know if you need any pointers—after today, I’m basically an expert.”

---

Vivi snorts softly behind you as you turn and head for the courtyard, her voice following like the dry wind of the desert:

&gt; “Only if I want it covered in juice and filed under ‘improvised weaponry.’”

---

You grin to yourself the whole walk down the corridor.

---

A few turns later, you find yourself near the **Marine coordination center**, a converted wing of the palace where Smoker and Tashigi have set up temporary operations. Civil engineers and uniformed officers shuffle maps, clipboards, and casualty reports like chess pieces across the desert's aftershocks.

You spot **Tashigi**, already suited back up in her standard uniform, hair pinned tighter than usual. She looks up the moment you approach—eyes squinting.

&gt; “You look smug.”

You flash your new ID badge like a kid showing off a perfect test score.

&gt; “I’m legitimate now. Fully-licensed. Kebab-access-verified.”

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “Congratulations. That means you’re finally taxable.”

&gt; “My proudest moment.”

---

Just then, **Smoker** steps out from one of the interior briefing rooms, lighting both cigars at once like a man actively trying to shorten his paperwork lifespan.

His eyes flick to you.

&gt; “You file in with the civil side?”

You nod.

&gt; “Royal Reconstruction Consultant.”

&gt; “Catchy,” he mutters. “What, are you doing foundation checks with your juice powers?”

&gt; “Only the *most foundational of responsibilities*, sir.”

---

Smoker exhales twin streams of smoke and grumbles something about “damn freelancers infiltrating the chain of command.”

He gestures toward the main desk, where a sealed envelope sits. It's heavy. Official.

&gt; “Paperwork came in from Marine HQ,” he says. “I was gonna tell her later—figured she was too busy clobbering civilians with wooden swords.”

Tashigi’s eyes narrow.

&gt; “...Captain?”

Smoker offers the envelope with all the grace of a man offering someone a particularly stressful birthday gift.

&gt; “**Congratulations, Ensign.** Effective immediately.”

---

Tashigi blinks.

Then looks down at the envelope in her hand like it’s warm to the touch.

&gt; “You pulled rank with HQ?” she asks, voice low, almost disbelieving.

&gt; “I put in a recommendation.” He shrugs. “HQ agreed. You earned it. That’s the job.”

She looks a little stunned.

Just for a second.

Then glances your way—like she might want to pretend it’s just a morning like any other.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Congratulate her respectfully—with some light teasing.}  
2. {Salute, dramatically. Maybe even bow. She deserves the moment.}  
3. {Play it cool, offer to buy her a kebab to celebrate. You *do* have official kebab privileges now.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - well, we knew it was coming. Enjoy the moment regardless 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Marine Coordination Wing, Morning]**  
**Scene: “Salutes and Small Victories”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Heartfelt | Mood: Warm, Earned Recognition**

---

Tashigi stares at the promotion letter in her hand like it’s heavier than it should be. The weight of expectation, of proving herself, of always trying to catch up to ghosts with swords in their hands—**you see it all in her eyes.**

You knew this was coming.

But it still hits different when it’s *here.*

---

So you do what’s right.

You straighten up.

Stand a little taller.

And then—with all the ceremony of a soldier, and none of the sarcasm of the teacher who once greased himself through an entire warzone—you give her a proper, sharp **salute.**

&gt; “Congratulations, Ensign Tashigi.”

Your voice is steady.

Sincere.

---

She looks up, caught off guard.

&gt; “You’re serious?” she mutters, almost defensively—like she expected a quip about paper-pushing or your baton finally having to answer to a superior.

You don’t budge.

&gt; “Dead serious. You earned that title. Fully. I saw it happen.”

A beat.

&gt; “Multiple times. Usually while I was bleeding behind you.”

---

Tashigi’s cheeks tint slightly. Not with embarrassment. With that rare, subtle kind of pride that only ever comes after being seen clearly and recognized for who you are.

She salutes back—clean, sharp.

Then lowers her hand and rolls her eyes—just a little.

&gt; “Alright, alright. You’re going to make Vivi think you’re getting *responsible* or something.”

---

Smoker grunts behind you both, clearly satisfied with the awkward emotional tension and immediately reaching for his report stack like he didn’t just help alter someone’s future.

&gt; “If you’re done saluting each other like rookies at a boot camp parade,” he mutters, “we’ve got two more rebel groups to debrief, and some fresh intel about Baroque Works remnants in the southern basin.”

---

You glance at Tashigi.

&gt; “Duty calls, Ensign.”

She snorts. Quiet. Soft.

&gt; “Still sounds weird.”

You grin.

&gt; “Sounds earned.”

---

**OOC: Tashigi’s bond with you deepens.**  
Not romantic—not yet. But something steady. Something built.

**Mutual respect. Quiet faith.**

And the beginning of a partnership worth defending.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Accompany Tashigi on her next patrol—maybe investigate the southern basin leads.}  
2. {Swing by Vivi’s office to relay the good news. She’ll want to celebrate it.}  
3. {Sneak off to try one of those kebab stalls with your hard-won food privileges. Possibly bring one back as a trophy.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Not many people dare face a logia warlord with nothing but a sword. You deserve that more than anyone else.

my ears perk up at the mention of Baroque works.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – South Gate Barracks, Late Morning]**  
**Scene: “Remnants in the Sand”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Investigative | Mood: Tension-Building, Quiet Determination**

---

You and Tashigi are already halfway down the marble stairwell before Smoker even finishes the word “southern.”  
She doesn’t say anything, but you can see the shift in her step—the controlled urgency, the Marine sense honed by battle and guilt and **unfinished business.**

---

You match her pace.

&gt; “Not many people dare to face a Logia warlord with nothing but a sword,” you say, your voice steady despite the bounce of descending steps.  
&gt; “You deserve that rank more than anyone else I’ve seen wear a uniform.”

She doesn’t respond immediately. Just lets her hair blow back in the dry courtyard breeze as you both cross the sandstone plaza toward the **South Gate Barracks**.

Then, finally, her voice—low:

&gt; “I still lost.”

You nudge her arm lightly with your elbow.

&gt; “And I still saw you *try.* With everything. That’s not losing, Tashigi-chan. That’s leading.”

---

**Your words hang between you**, not as flattery, but as shared memory.

The kind that binds people.

The kind forged in chaos, sealed in silence, and remembered in the way a companion walks beside you, not behind.

---

You arrive at the **southern watch post**, where two Royal Guards flank a **tightly folded map on a makeshift table**, along with **an open crate of confiscated weapons**—rusty, mismatched, but far too organized for a few desert looters.

One of the officers salutes as you approach.

&gt; “Ma’am. Civilian Advisor.”

&gt; “Royal Reconstruction Consultant,” you correct automatically.

Tashigi smirks faintly.

&gt; “Report.”

The guard nods.

&gt; “Two patrols found signs of movement around an abandoned waystation near the southern basin line. Footprints circling what used to be a Baroque Works supply cache. Light, fast, organized. No rebel colors. No royal banners. We think… it might be **remnant agents.**”

---

You squint at the map.

Your ears, already perked at the name “Baroque Works,” twitch further.

&gt; “That cache was near the old sandstone quarry, right?”  
&gt; “Perfect place for an ambush, if they’re staging something.”

Tashigi folds her arms.

&gt; “They could be trying to recover something Crocodile left behind.”

You glance at her.

&gt; “Or tie up loose ends.”

---

She nods once.

&gt; “We leave in ten. Two guards, us, light gear.”

&gt; “Want me to bring Kiwi Kop?” you ask, only half-joking.

&gt; “Only if it doesn’t flood the whole basin.”

&gt; “No promises.”

---

**OOC: A patrol mission is forming—more than a routine walk, less than a full siege. Think: Recon &amp; Response.**

Objectives may include:

- Identifying remnant agents  
- Preventing recovery of Baroque Works materials  
- Capturing any surviving leadership figures (ex. Mr. 7, Mr. 11, etc.)  
- Avoiding further civilian conflict

---

Would you like to:

1. {Prep with palace gear—light armor, travel cloak, maybe a few potions/snacks.}  
2. {Head out immediately with minimal equipment, catch them before they scatter.}  
3. {Split roles—Tashigi leads front, you flank solo with a mini Kiwi scout active. Risky but stealthier.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - I left my old bounty hunter's gear at home. Guess I'll use their kit. It doesn't fit perfectly, but it sure looks fancier.

To Tashigi's comment about losing - Rank doesn't always mean winning. I heard a rumor of a Commodore in the East Blue that got annihilated by some pirate group in the Conomi islands. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace – Outfitting Room, Before Departure]**  
**Scene: “Reconstruction Consultant, Reporting for Field Duty”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Honest, Battle-Ready, Quiet Camaraderie**

---

You adjust the straps on your borrowed **field vest**, cinching the slightly too-wide chest plate with a grunt as the palace quartermaster checks for loose stitching. The gear’s clearly made for a **stockier frame**, but you make it work—nothing a little belt-tightening and strategic Kiwi slick couldn’t fix in a pinch.

It’s simple gear:  
**Sturdy boots**, **weather-treated shoulder pads**, **a desert cloak**, and a **palace-marked sash** with your official insignia stitched into the hem.

&gt; “Looks good on you,” one of the young guards mutters as he hands you a travel flask.  
&gt; “If you stand in the right lighting, you almost look like someone who wins fights.”

&gt; “Hey, I *survive* them,” you counter.  
&gt; “That’s a form of winning.”

---

As you step out into the main yard where **Tashigi’s already waiting**, boots planted, arms crossed, sword freshly cleaned, she glances over her shoulder at you.

Eyes flicking over the gear.

&gt; “You clean up alright.”

You smirk.

&gt; “And you still look like you could parry a thunderstorm.”

---

She starts walking, and you fall in beside her. Two guards follow, light crossbows on their backs.

As the **southern wind picks up**, you pull your hood up loosely, ready for the grit and sun. Your baton’s strapped across your back—Sea-Prism tip polished, handle scuffed from too many recent nightmares made real.

---

Then—quietly, as the gate starts to lower—you speak again.

&gt; “About what you said earlier. That you lost.”

She doesn’t answer immediately.

&gt; “Rank doesn’t always mean winning, you know. I once heard about a **Commodore in the East Blue** who got annihilated by some pirates at the **Conomi Islands**.”

Tashigi glances at you.

&gt; “Arlong.”

You nod.

&gt; “That’s the one. Guy got chewed up by a shark-man and his goons. Rank meant nothing when the fight came.”

You give her a sidelong glance.

&gt; “But you? You *stood* against a Warlord with a sword and your spine. That’s more than a title. That’s character.”

---

Tashigi doesn’t respond for a long moment.

Then—quietly:

&gt; “I’m starting to understand that.”

And she means it.

---

**[Mission Start: Desert Remnant Sweep]**  
**Location: Sandstone Quarry, Southern Basin**  
**Team: You, Tashigi, 2 Royal Guards**  
**Objective: Investigate movement at former Baroque supply cache. Engage only if necessary.**

**Gear Acquired:**
- Desert Cloak (+ minor sun resistance)  
- Reinforced travel vest (+1 to minor wound threshold)  
- Satchel with: 1 health poultice, 1 desert ration, 1 juice stabilizing canteen  
- Loaned palace comm shell (short-range Den Den Mushi, 2 km effective)

---

As the gates open, and you begin your ride across the southern trail, dust trailing behind your boots like ghostly echoes of a war barely ended—

You realize something.

You’re not chasing peace anymore.

You’re helping build it.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Talk with the guards en route—learn more about recent sightings.}  
2. {Walk in silence. Focus. Feel the land. Let the tension build naturally.}  
3. {Deploy a mini Kiwi scout down the ridge when the quarry nears. Risk early detection.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Shoot the shit with the guards. Talking about worming my way through alleys during the final battle.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[South Alubarna Trail – En Route to Quarry]**  
**Scene: “Desert Chatter &amp; Gooey Glory”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Bonding, Morale Boost**

---

The four of you march in a loose column, the **sun flaring off the dunes** like a furnace full of mirages. Your cloak flaps lightly in the breeze, your boots crunch grit beneath. Tashigi walks ahead with the calm, unreadable face of someone who’s keeping her mind sharp—blade ready to draw at a moment’s notice.

But the **two guards**, a pair of young royal infantrymen named **Jalim and Mikk**, trail just a few paces back.

They whisper for a while.

Until one finally blurts:

&gt; “Hey, sir—*Consultant*, I mean—are the rumors true?”

You turn, raising an eyebrow.

&gt; “Which rumors?”

Jalim leans forward with wide eyes.

&gt; “The ones where you turned into a giant… *juice dragon* during the final battle! They said you swam through a puddle like a fish and exploded out of a vent!”

Mikk elbows him.

&gt; “No, idiot, that was Snack Pack—the Bananagator he *tamed*. Get it right.”

---

You give a long sigh. And then start **grinning**.

&gt; “Alright, alright, settle down. I’ll tell you how it happened.”

---

As the sun climbs and the trail winds toward the first crumbling ridge of the **old sandstone basin**, you regale the guards with your gloriously exaggerated tale:

- **You**, crawling through alleys like a **greased-up predator**, leaving trails of *citrus doom* behind you.
- The **concussive headbutt** into a Baroque agent’s plated chest, which you dramatically refer to as *“Kiwi Blitzkrieg.”*
- The **Emerald Titan** erupting from a pool of fruit and desperation at the 5-minute mark—*“an elemental of tropical vengeance,”* you explain, hands waving for dramatic effect.
- And your *strategic* napping that “lured Crocodile into a false sense of victory.”

---

By the end, both guards are *howling*, Mikk trying not to trip over his own feet.

Tashigi, from the front, calls back without turning:

&gt; “You forgot the part where you flopped over Vivi’s lap and muttered about Snack Pack in your sleep.”

You pause.

&gt; “That was a *tactical morale reset.*”

---

Jalim pipes up.

&gt; “Sir, if I die today, I just want to say I’m glad I got to patrol with the Sticky Knight of Alubarna.”

You hold up a hand.

&gt; “Sticky *Consultant*, thank you.”

---

The tone shifts as you reach the **crest of the ridge**, and the **quarry stretches below you**: stone ruins, a cracked supply depot, faded Baroque markings barely visible on the sandstone.

Everything’s quiet. Too quiet.

---

**OOC: Morale boost achieved. Guards are loyal, in good spirits.**  
You may gain a small bonus to rolls involving teamwork or protection of the guards.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Deploy Kiwi Scout for a look inside the depot before descending.}  
2. {Send one guard around the flank while you descend with the rest.}  
3. {Enter quietly as a group—slow, deliberate, minimize noise.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - hold on Tashigi-chan. Check this out.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Southern Sandstone Quarry – Overlook Ridge]**  
**Scene: “Fruit Reconnaissance”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical | Mood: Lightly Dramatic, Focused**

---

You hold up a hand as the wind tugs at your cloak.

&gt; “Hold up, Tashigi-chan. You’re about to witness some *real* tactical innovation.”

She pauses mid-step, turning with a single arched eyebrow.

&gt; “If this ends with you falling down the hill again, I’m drawing my sword.”

You grin and step toward the edge of the ridge, crouching down as you draw moisture from your palm. The air hisses slightly as **a translucent puddle of green-yellow kiwi juice** spreads across the dusty stone beneath you.

You narrow your eyes.

Focus.

---

&gt; “Operation: Kiwi Recon engaged.”

---

**The puddle ripples—then coils upward into a tiny, gelatinous figure.**  
Two arms. A bulbous upper body. No legs, but a trail like a snail behind it.  
Eyes? Technically, no. But you **will** it to know where to go.

It gives you a little *splurt*.

&gt; “That’s Kiwi Scout 1,” you say to the others, wiping your hands.  
&gt; “He’s a reconnaissance specialist. Probably unionized.”

Jalim and Mikk exchange stunned glances. One whispers, “...he’s *so* small.”

&gt; “He’s proud,” you reply.

---

You gently place him at the edge of a broken slope leading into the depot’s ruins.

He oozes down, silently, his **slick trail of juice hidden in the color of the sand.**

---

**OOC: SCOUT DEPLOYED.**

**Recon Roll (Kiwi Scout Stealth &amp; Sensory Relay)**  
- Kiwi Scout Stealth: (1d20+2) → **17 + 2 = 19**  
- Enemy Perception: (1d20+1) → **4 + 1 = 5**

---

**SUCCESS.**

---

You close your eyes as the **sensation of the scout’s movement pulses through your palm**—soft vibrations, like gentle footfalls echoed through syrup.

Inside the depot… it’s **quiet. But not empty.**

You feel:

- Two heat signatures—human. One moving. One seated.  
- Scattered crates, likely opened recently.  
- A faint, sharp smell—like **oiled steel and smoked parchment. Gunpowder? Traps?**  
- The **distinct rumble of a Den Den Mushi**, either active or recently used.

---

&gt; “There are at least two people in there,” you mutter.  
&gt; “One pacing. One sitting, probably watching. Doesn’t feel like they’re panicking.”

Tashigi kneels beside you, listening closely.

&gt; “Could be leadership. Or a holdout cell.”

&gt; “They cracked some of the old supply crates. There’s... weapon scent. Could be prepping something nasty.”

---

You look up at the rest of the team.

&gt; “They haven’t noticed us yet. If we want to move, we move smart.”

---

**OOC: Excellent scout read. Surprise round available if you choose to engage.**

Would you like to:

1. {Send Tashigi and a guard to circle around while you and the second guard breach from above.}  
2. {Attempt to intercept the Den Den Mushi—find out who they were talking to before they finish.}  
3. {Engage all together—fast and overwhelming, try to subdue before they react.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - you think we should call for backup? I recall the kiwi scout, and grow it near human size

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Southern Sandstone Quarry – Pre-Assault Position]**  
**Scene: “Kiwi Titan: Recon Edition”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Strategic | Mood: Rising Tension, Controlled Chaos**

---

You rise from your crouch and glance toward Tashigi, still kneeling, her sword unsheathed just slightly—just enough for you to catch a **glimmer of readiness** in her eyes.

&gt; “Think we should call for backup?” you ask in a low murmur.  
&gt; “This could be nothing. Or it could be another chapter of Crocodile’s memoirs.”

Tashigi doesn’t immediately answer.

She peers toward the depot’s battered rooftop, eyes narrowing, calculating wind, distance, elevation, sightlines.

&gt; “No. If we move now, we have surprise. If we wait, they vanish. Or worse—finish whatever they’re trying to pull together.”

She turns to you.

&gt; “We take them.”

You nod. The decision made.

---

You raise your hand and **call back Kiwi Scout**—the trail of glistening juice suddenly doubling back like a reverse drip, coiling into your palm with a faint squelch and shimmer of light.

Tashigi flinches slightly.

Jalim stares in awe.

Mikk: “What the hell—”

---

You concentrate, pulling deeper on your fruit’s **viscous reserve**. The juice gathers in thick coils, and you slam your hand into the dirt as it *erupts upward* in a wet roar.

**Kiwi Kop emerges.**

No legs. Just mass—**four feet high**, barrel-chested, **bubbling with sticky density.** Two arms shaped more like clubs than fists, and a **faint juice steam** wafting off his shoulders like he’s been waiting to hit something all week.

He flexes.

You nod.

&gt; “Alright, bud. Keep up. Don’t punch Tashigi.”

He ripples in acknowledgment. Maybe a thumbs-up. Hard to tell. You’ll count it.

---

**Tashigi signals.**

The two guards draw weapons.

And you, Kiwi Kop, and the team move in fast, **cutting down the slope in a practiced arc**, hugging the stone as you close in on the **broken depot door**.

You whisper.

&gt; “Breaching on my mark…”

---

**OOC: You now have the initiative. Surprise round unlocked. Enemy unaware. Two hostiles confirmed.**

Kiwi Kop will take one auto-assist action per round (distraction, body shield, pinning attack).

Would you like to:

1. {Lead the breach—kick in the door and go loud. Have Kiwi Kop rush center.}  
2. {Slip in through the broken window, flank left while Tashigi and guards breach the front.}  
3. {Use Kiwi Kop as a distraction—send him in first while you and the team cover exits.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Kiwi Kop can take hits. We fleshy humans can't. He takes point.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot – Surprise Breach, Round One]**  
**Scene: “Kiwi Kop Kicks the Door”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical | Mood: Controlled Chaos, Imminent Clash**

---

&gt; “Kiwi Kop—*breach and distract.*”

The elemental doesn’t answer in words—just rumbles low in the pit of its citrus core and barrels forward with a **squelchy battle cry** that sounds like a blender hitting overdrive.

---

**WHAM!**

The depot’s front door **explodes inward** with a wet **crack**, splinters flying as juice sprays against the entryway like a tropical crime scene. One of the guards lets out a stunned gasp.

**You charge right after.**

Tashigi’s blade flashes in the sunlight, and both guards flank tight—**textbook triangle formation** behind your fruit-fueled battering ram.

---

**Inside:**

The depot’s dim, musty interior is half-collapsed, the roof held up by old scaffolding and warped beams. Crates line the far wall, many pried open. An **inactive Den Den Mushi** sits on a box—its receiver glinting in the dusty light.

And the two occupants—**definitely Baroque Works remnants.**

- **Agent 1 (standing):** Tall, wiry, wrapped in desert layers. Wields a pair of **boomerang blades**, etched with the Baroque logo. Eyes widen just as Kiwi Kop crashes through.
- **Agent 2 (sitting):** Shorter, heavyset, **fumbling with what looks like a detonation talisman** or scroll. He scrambles backward, too slow.

---

**Surprise Round Triggered.**

**You act first. Choose one:**

1. {Order Kiwi Kop to pin the sitting one before he finishes arming the explosive. You handle the standing one.}  
2. {Focus on disabling the standing blade-wielder. Let Tashigi and guards handle the other.}  
3. {Juice spray the whole room. Control terrain. Let everyone move freely while enemies slip around.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Bomb! Secure it!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot – Combat Engaged, Round One (Surprise)]**  
**Scene: “Sticky Disarmament”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Controlled Chaos, Citrus Precision**

---

&gt; “**Bomb! Secure it!**” you bark, voice sharp, firm, commanding.

You thrust your arm forward—and **Kiwi Kop lurches into action** like a living tidal wave.

---

**Action: Kiwi Kop – Pinning Grapple Attempt on Seated Agent (Explosives Handler)**  
- Kiwi Grapple: (1d20+6) → **17 + 6 = 23**  
- Agent Resist: (1d20+3) → **11 + 3 = 14**  

**Result: SUCCESSFUL PIN.**

---

The citrus elemental **surges across the floor**, slapping its bulk down on the seated agent like a crashing tide. The enemy lets out a muffled *“GGAHHRGH!”* as he's smothered beneath a mountain of sticky pressure.

The **detonation scroll drops** from his hands and **clatters harmlessly** onto the floor, glimmering faintly with latent heat.

Kiwi Kop ripples, adjusting his bulk to press down harder—just enough to prevent any sudden movements.

&gt; “Target restrained!” one of the guards shouts, stepping in to flank and **retrieve the explosive** with tongs from his kit.

---

**Meanwhile…**

The **standing agent recovers** quickly, letting out a low growl. His twin boomerangs whip out in a V-shaped arc.

&gt; “We were promised an escape. We *were told* the war was still ours!”

**Combat Triggered: Agent 1 – Boomerang Attack at You (Disrupt the Commander)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+5) → **14 + 5 = 19**  
- Your AC (with field gear): 15  
- **HIT.**

---

One blade **ricochets off your shoulder**, slicing through the cloak and drawing a sharp **sting** across your bicep. Pain blooms—manageable, but it’ll bruise deep.

&gt; “Tch—Juice guy or not, I’ll carve through all of you!”

---

**Tashigi reacts.**

&gt; “Not if I take your blades first.”

**Tashigi Action – Disarming Counterstrike (Flash Draw)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+8) → **16 + 8 = 24**  
- Damage: (1d10+3) → **9 + 3 = 12**  
- Special: DISARM check (Contested):  
   - Tashigi: (1d20+5) → 19  
   - Agent: (1d20+2) → 7  

**Result: CRIT MOMENT.**

---

Tashigi darts forward with a fluid **iaijutsu slice**, her blade catching the returning boomerang mid-arc and **slamming it into the floor** with a crunch of steel and sand.

The enemy stumbles, wide-eyed.

&gt; “You—!”

&gt; “Ensign Tashigi,” she snaps, stance perfect.  
&gt; “Remember the name.”

---

**Combat Summary – Round 1:**

- **You:** Lightly injured (shoulder), standing.  
- **Kiwi Kop:** Fully active, restraining Agent 2 (immobilized).  
- **Agent 1:** Disarmed (one weapon), staggered.  
- **Tashigi:** Full health, dominating melee.  
- **Guards:** Secured the detonation scroll. One guard covering exits.

---

**Next Move Options:**

1. {Spray Agent 1 with slippery juice—turn terrain against him, aid Tashigi’s next strike.}  
2. {Close the distance and engage with your baton. Try to KO him.}  
3. {Order Kiwi Kop to shift pressure—maybe squeeze out information from Agent 2.}

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot – Combat Round Two]**  
**Scene: “Juice Meets Jaw”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Heroic | Mood: Tense, Focused, Righteous Impact**

---

**You drop your stance, baton in hand—fully extended now, the glint of Sea-Prism Stone catching a sliver of light through the dust-hazed roof.**

Your shoulder’s throbbing where the boomerang caught you, but you push through it. That bastard aimed to maim, maybe kill. The kids you protect back home? This is what you keep them *away* from.

---

You step forward—no hesitation.

Tashigi locks eyes with you as you pass.

&gt; “Take him.”

&gt; “With pleasure.”

---

**ACTION: Close Combat (Baton Strike – Sea-Prism Tip, Target: Agent 1)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+5) → **16 + 5 = 21**  
- Agent’s AC: 15  
- **HIT.**  
- Damage Roll: (1d8+2) → **7 + 2 = 9**  
- Status: **Staggered, CON Save (Stun from Sea-Prism):**  
   - Agent Roll: (1d20+1) → **5 + 1 = 6**  
   - **FAIL.**

---

**CRACK.**

The baton lands *square across his ribs*, sending a *sickening thump* through the depot. The Sea-Prism tip glows briefly as it connects—**nullifying energy**, scrambling nerves, breaking his stance.

The agent **gurgles**, drops his second boomerang, and **collapses to one knee**—stunned, windless.

---

One of the guards gasps.

&gt; “Whoa. That was—was that Sea-Prism? Is he still breathing?”

&gt; “He’s fine,” you mutter.  
&gt; “Just not going anywhere for a while.”

---

**Kiwi Kop continues sitting merrily on the explosives guy**, who’s now flailing uselessly with only a muffled groan escaping beneath pulpy pressure.

---

**Tashigi doesn’t smile—but her voice drops an octave.**

&gt; “Nice swing. Your form’s improving.”

You let out a half-chuckle.

&gt; “All those beatings from you finally paid off.”

---

**Combat Ends – Total Victory.**

- **Agent 1:** Unconscious, captured.  
- **Agent 2:** Restrained by Kiwi Kop.  
- **Explosives secured.**  
- **No casualties.**  
- **Tashigi:** Slightly impressed. Maybe a little more than slightly.

---

**Loot / Clues:**

- 1 Den Den Mushi (was active recently, still warm)  
- Open crates of **unmarked weapons** and **Baroque Works insignia** armor fragments  
- A folded map showing **tunnels leading east of Alubarna**, with multiple X marks along old **rebel staging camps**  
- A sealed envelope, waxed in **Crocodile’s sigil** – unopened

---

Would you like to:

1. {Help restrain the agents for interrogation—maybe see what the envelope says.}  
2. {Check the map and report this to Smoker immediately. Potential sleeper cells.}  
3. {Open the envelope in private first. You’re the one who bled for this.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Optio X: Crush the detonator. 

That should remove the threat of that crate of explosives in the corner.

**POV: You**  
**Tone: Precautionary | Mood: Controlled, Cautious, Dust-Settled Tension**

---

The air is still buzzing from the clash—**the scent of scorched dust and citrus still heavy.** Kiwi Kop emits a gurgling purr as he maintains pressure on the squirming explosives handler, who is slowly realizing that oxygen, like ambition, is in short supply beneath a juice elemental.

You glance at the **scroll-sized detonator**, sitting on the nearby crate—its runes glowing faintly, trembling with unspent potential. Your eyes flick to the stack of **aged explosive crates** tucked along the wall, **Baroque Works sigils half-burned into the wood.**

Your fingers twitch toward your baton.

---

&gt; “Nope,” you mutter.  
&gt; “We don’t play with live fireworks in a wooden depot.”

**With one fluid motion—**

You **slam the Sea-Prism baton down** on the detonator scroll.

**ROLL: Baton Strike – Delicate Device, Non-Magical Neutralization**  
- (1d20+4) → 17 + 4 = **21**  
- Result: **SUCCESS**

---

The baton connects with a sharp **CRACK**, shattering the talisman into two curling, fizzling strips. A pulse of heated air ripples across the room, but the runes extinguish—**like a flame smothered by willpower and citrusy disdain.**

The nearby crates stop humming.

&gt; “Well,” one of the guards breathes out, “I just unclenched muscles I forgot I had.”

---

Tashigi nods in quiet approval, giving the crates a careful inspection.

&gt; “No secondary trigger. Scroll was the main conduit. Nicely done.”

You give a mock bow.

&gt; “Preventing sudden combustion: just part of the job now, ma’am.”

---

The depot falls into that **strangely sacred post-battle silence**, broken only by the faint squeaks of the Den Den Mushi still sitting on the crate. It's not transmitting anymore, but it **was active.**

And that envelope—still sealed, still untouched—rests quietly in the shadow of the weapons rack.

---

**Kiwi Kop slowly raises one syrupy arm, giving you a thumbs-up. Probably.**  
You're not sure what that gesture means in his species.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Open the envelope and read what Baroque left behind.}  
2. {Pass the envelope to Tashigi, letting her handle it as ranking officer.}  
3. {Secure the site and call in reinforcements. You’ve cleared the quarry, but there may be more out there.}

**Tone: Suspicious | Mood: Slow-Build Realization, Controlled Curiosity**

---

You crouch over the remains of the detonator scroll, baton still humming faintly from the impact.

At first, it’s just **charred parchment**, still smoldering faintly at the edges. Standard **Baroque-issue explosive rune work**—you’d seen similar schematics during a post-battle briefing from a palace engineer.

But there’s something… **off.**

---

You squint.

The inner layer of the scroll—curled like a burnt cinnamon roll—has **an additional inscription** underneath the primary trigger runes. Hidden by the top parchment. Smaller. Carved **not with ink**, but **pressed indentations**, nearly invisible unless you were up close.

You trace your fingers gently along the grooves.

It’s **not a second explosive command.**

It’s…

&gt; *&quot;D.E. – 402. NW of Alubarna. Burn after use. He suspects.&quot;*

Your brow furrows.

D.E.?

---

You glance up as **Tashigi takes the sealed envelope**, her expression unreadable as she slips it into a protected pouch on her belt.

&gt; “Chain of evidence. Smoker should see it first,” she mutters.

You nod slowly—but your focus is still on the **new inscription.**

You mutter under your breath:

&gt; “Not just a bomb. This was a *message.* Hidden beneath the trigger.”

---

And the timing…

The scroll was still active.

Which meant **whoever was listening... might’ve been waiting for a signal.**

Or worse—

They might’ve **heard everything up to the moment you crushed it.**

---

**OOC: You’ve uncovered a covert coordination network. “D.E.” is a code. Possibly a person. Possibly a site. Possibly a trap.**  
You have a lead: **“402 – NW of Alubarna.”** Perhaps a rendezvous point, bunker, or fallback zone.

**Clue quietly logged.** Only you noticed the hidden message.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Keep this information private for now—too soon to trust anyone fully.}  
2. {Tell Tashigi discreetly when the guards aren’t listening.}  
3. {Tell Smoker directly once you return to the palace. Let him decide.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option X - This isn't a detonator... It looks more like a timer...

You freeze.

Your gaze slowly turns from the cracked scroll beneath your hand…  
…to the **row of crates** in the far corner.

The ones with the **Baroque sigils** half-sanded away.  
The ones you’d assumed were inert.  
The ones Tashigi now stands beside—one boot casually planted on a reinforced lid, pulling down a bundle of weather-worn folders from a high shelf.

---

And then the gears in your mind begin to **click.**

**It wasn’t a remote detonator.**  
**It was a delay fuse. A countdown.**

A *start* trigger.

---

The scroll you crushed…  
*Didn’t deactivate anything.*  
It **started something.**

You catch a faint sound—**not a hum**, not magic—but the **deep, mechanical *ticking*** you’d missed beneath the citrus stink and adrenaline.

The **crates are hot again.**  
Too hot.

---

&gt; “Tashigi—”

Your voice is tight, rough, forced through a throat suddenly too small.

&gt; “Tashigi, MOVE.”

---

**OOC: PAUSED.**  
(When ready, we will continue with a timed threat event: ticking time bomb. Lives on the line.  
React quickly. Narrate or act. Every moment counts.)

&gt;&gt; USER: In one movement, pure instinct, I run over and wrap my arms around Tashigi's waist, then spin her around, facing away from the crate. I will Kiwi Kop to get behind me and attempt to smother the crate. Before I can offer an explanation to her flustered/embarrassd squawk, or push her away, the drowned crate detonates.

Not as catastrophically as it could've been (otherwise we'd all have become sketchy kebab meat), but it's still big. Heavy injuries expected.

&gt; *Tashigi’s too close.*  
&gt; *There’s no time to yell.*  
&gt; *There’s only time to act.*

---

**You’re at her side in one breath.**

Your arms lock around her waist—**not with finesse, but with ferocity.**

She lets out a startled, indignant gasp:

&gt; “Wh–!?”

But there’s no time.

You **pivot**, slam your boots into the dirt, and **twist her away from the crate** just as a tremor runs through the floorboards like the bones of a dying beast.

---

&gt; “Kiwi Kop! *NOW!*”

The elemental answers with a **guttural roar**, flinging itself over the nearest crate like a sloshing shield wall—its limbs stretching into **a great dome of syrupy resistance**.

Too little time.  
Too much explosive.

---

**BOOM.**

The **crate erupts.**

A flood of sand, shrapnel, and smoke **slams into your back like a giant's hammer.**  
**Kiwi Kop absorbs the brunt of it**—but even his saturated body **ripples and shatters**, shards of juice flinging outward like flecks of acid rain.

**You bear the rest.**

---

**CONSEQUENCES:**

- Shockwave Damage: (2d10+5) → **9 + 7 + 5 = 21**  
- Mitigation from Kiwi Kop: **-8**  
- Mitigation from Gear: **-3**  
- Final Impact: **10 HP direct trauma + blast concussion**

**Result: Brutally injured. Cracked ribs. Burned shoulder. Temporarily deaf in one ear.**

---

You hit the ground hard, **Tashigi tumbling on top of you**, shielded from the brunt of the explosion. Her arms scramble around you the moment the world stops spinning.

&gt; “EATONE?!”

Her voice is muffled—**everything’s muffled.** Like you're underwater, brain still vibrating inside your skull.

---

Your cloak is half burned.

Your badge is dented.

Your back feels like it’s trying to **separate from your spine**.

And still—

You’re breathing.

She is, too.

The guards scramble. One’s yelling. The other’s coughing through smoke.

You see a **giant streak of emerald juice** slowly pooling under what’s left of Kiwi Kop—splattered against the far wall, **broken but loyal to the last drop.**

Tashigi’s face hovers over yours—smeared with ash, eyes blazing.

&gt; “Why would you—? What the hell were you thinking?!”

Your hearing’s still not fully back.

Your heartbeat’s too loud.

But you manage a rasp.

&gt; “Instinct.”

Then a faint smile.

&gt; “...Tactical morale reset.”

---

**OOC: You’re alive. Kiwi Kop is out of commission. Tashigi is safe.**

But something *more sinister* is now confirmed:

**Baroque Works left sleeper explosives wired to *timed detonation orders*, not remote signals. Meaning others may be active elsewhere.**

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Wave off help, try to stand. Let her yell while you focus on the mission.}  
2. {Let her yell. You’re not getting up anytime soon. Take the scolding. You earned it.}  
3. {Ask someone to check the map. “402 NW of Alubarna.” You have a sinking feeling.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 2 - it feels like Mr. 4 and his stupid cannonballs all over again. I groan, unable to get up. Look Tashigi up and down for any injuries 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot – Aftermath, Scorched Ground]**  
**Scene: “Bruised, Broken, Breathing”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Exhausted | Mood: Gut-Punched Gravity, Fierce Concern**

---

You lie on the floor like a man who just got used as a **fruit-based meat shield**, because, well… **you were.**

Your back screams.

Your legs don’t want to work.

Your ears are ringing.

Your ribs feel like they’re holding a personal grudge.

And for a flicker of a second—just a second—you swear you can still hear **Snack Pack’s battle cry** in the recesses of your memory.

---

&gt; “Uuugh... not again…” you mutter with a dry wheeze.  
&gt; “Feels like Mr. 4’s stupid cannonballs all over again.”

You **groan**—not out of pain this time, but out of sheer exhausted *offense.*

---

You **tilt your head** weakly toward Tashigi, eyes scanning her.

She’s ash-dusted, her coat torn along one shoulder, and her hair’s half-fallen from its clip. But she’s upright. Breathing. Not bleeding. And most importantly—

**Still whole.**

---

Her hands are on you—**checking your pulse**, fumbling for wounds—her movements jerky, wild with adrenaline. Then she sees your eyes locked on hers.

&gt; “You—You absolute *idiot.*”

&gt; “Valid.”

&gt; “You threw yourself on me like some *dramatized ballad hero!* Do you think that makes you noble?! That could’ve—You almost—!”

Her hands clench into fists on your collar. Her jaw trembles.

But her eyes don’t leave yours.

&gt; “You didn’t have to.”

You manage a pained smile.

&gt; “Actually... I kinda did.”

---

She stares a beat longer.

Then—

**gently**—lets your collar go.

And stays right beside you, knees in the dirt, her blade laid across her lap like an extension of her body.

---

**Behind her, the guards are shouting for a medic.**  
Someone’s dragging the remaining agent up from where Kiwi Kop pinned him.  
The other starts poking the blackened crates cautiously with the **blunt end of his spear**.

---

&gt; “Check every seal,” Tashigi calls without turning.  
&gt; “These weren’t mines. They were *warnings.*”

Then to you, softer:

&gt; “You see a bomb again, pineapple? **Shout first.** Dramatically throw yourself into harm *second.*”

You groan again.

&gt; “Noted.”

---

**OOC: Severe wound sustained. You're currently in the &quot;crippled&quot; state—limited combat ability until healed.**

**Tashigi: unharmed physically. Emotionally? Rattled. Deepened bond. Respect laced with anger and fear for your safety.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask to be carried back to town with full dramatic flair. Make it awkward.}  
2. {Insist on staying for the evidence sweep. Let Tashigi scold you more while you lie there.}  
3. {Mention the “402 NW” code quietly, while you’re down—let her investigate it further.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Ohhhhhhh I'm going to need more of that palace healthcare again. I hope they don't bill me this time.

And don't tell me that I shouldn't have shielded you. You could've died. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot – Emergency Evac, Post-Incident]**  
**Scene: “Heroic Mush, Part II”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Pained Humor | Mood: Protective Instinct, Emotional Tension, Slow Exit**

---

You lie there like a man who just went five rounds with a sandstorm and lost a fight to a crate.

With a **raspy wheeze**, you raise one shaky arm toward the sky like a tragic theater actor, your other hand resting over your ribs like you’re auditioning for a particularly *dramatic* play called *&quot;Oh No, My Spine.&quot;*

&gt; “Oooooohhhh... I’m gonna need more of that **palace healthcare** again. And this time... I really hope they don’t bill me.”

Tashigi exhales hard, fighting the smirk trying to tug at the corner of her mouth.

---

She crouches back down, her gloved hand gently nudging your cheek to keep your head elevated while one of the guards approaches with a **folding stretcher**.

&gt; “You’re a mess.”

&gt; “Correction: I am a *heroic* mess.”

You look up at her with all the composure of someone who just got thrown by the plot—and *landed in friendship*.

---

&gt; “And don’t even try to tell me I shouldn’t have shielded you.”  
&gt; “You could’ve *died*, Tashigi.”

She opens her mouth.

Closes it again.

---

A flicker of frustration crosses her face—but it’s not **anger**.  
Not really.

It’s guilt. It’s fear.  
And maybe—just maybe—it’s something even heavier.

&gt; “And if *you* died, then what, huh?” she mutters.  
&gt; “Do you know what that would’ve done to Vivi? To me?”

Your grin falters just slightly.

Then you speak, quieter this time.

&gt; “But you *didn’t* die.”

&gt; “You lived. That's... all I needed to make peace with it.”

---

The guard snorts as he finishes unfolding the stretcher.

&gt; “You two want me to give you a minute, or should I go build you a chapel?”

&gt; “Shut it,” Tashigi and you say at the same time.

---

**OOC: Palace medical wing is on standby.**  
You’ll be evacuated, placed under observation, and restricted from combat for the next few days.

---

As Tashigi kneels beside the stretcher and guides your battered body onto it, her touch is *surprisingly gentle*. She doesn’t look away once. Doesn’t hide the way her brow furrows, or how her lips twitch when you wince.

She mutters under her breath, barely audible.

&gt; “Next time, we go down together.”

---

Would you like to:

1. {Reply seriously—tell her that’s not an option. Someone always has to live.}  
2. {Reply with humor—“If you want a joint grave, at least let me pick the headstone.”}  
3. {Stay quiet. Just give her hand a squeeze while you’re carried away.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 1 - Fuck no. If I can save a life, I'm saving a life. If I can your life, I'm definitely saving your life.

Use some kiwi juice to soothe some of the burns.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[On the Road Back to Alubarna – Evacuation Stretcher, Late Afternoon]**  
**Scene: “Conviction on the Cobblestone”**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Vulnerable, Steeled, Intimate**

---

The stretcher creaks beneath you, carried carefully by one guard in front and another at the rear. **The desert wind has shifted cooler**, evening clouds rolling in to cast **dappled shadows** across the sand-blasted trail leading back to the capital.

Tashigi walks beside you, quiet, hands folded behind her back like a cadet on silent duty. Her expression is fixed forward—guarded. But you can feel the tension **in her shoulders**, the way her steps slow each time she looks at you out of the corner of her eye.

She thinks she’s hiding it.

She’s not.

---

&gt; “Next time,” she’d said.  
&gt; “We go down together.”

---

You grunt, managing to raise a **shaking hand**, drawing the smallest bit of kiwi juice to your palm.

It’s golden, sticky-sweet this time—**your subconscious desire to comfort reflected in its flavor.** You gently smear it over a **nasty patch of burn** at your side, hissing under your breath as the cool salve begins to **ease the pain** and slow the bubbling soreness.

Then you turn your head toward her. Voice hoarse, but **unyielding**.

&gt; “Fuck no.”

She blinks, taken aback.

You push through the pain, lock eyes with her.

&gt; “If I can save a life, I’m saving a life. *Any* life.”

&gt; “If I can save *your* life?”

You breathe out slowly. A bit of blood catches on your lower lip, but you wipe it off with the back of your sleeve.

&gt; “Then I’m *definitely* saving your life.”

---

The guards exchange a glance but wisely say nothing.

Tashigi slows in her step, staring at you now—fully, openly. Like she doesn’t know whether to yell at you, slap you, or sit down beside you and never leave again.

---

Finally, she mutters, voice low, nearly swallowed by the wind:

&gt; “...you really are the most irresponsible responsible adult I’ve ever met.”

&gt; “I contain multitudes,” you rasp.

She shakes her head. Then—slowly—reaches out and **places one gloved hand lightly over yours**, careful of the juice but still… grounded. Present.

She doesn't let go the rest of the walk back.

---

**OOC: Scene concluded.**  
You are returned to the palace under immediate care.  
Your wounds are now considered **healing**, but you remain **combat-ineffective** for 2 in-game days.  
**Tashigi remains close**. She speaks little, but your bond has solidified beyond mere duty.

**Progression Gained:**
- [x] Kiwi Fruit – Passive Use: Minor Soothing/Healing Effect (Limited use, non-combat)  
- [x] Emotional Anchor: “Tashigi’s Survival = Non-Negotiable Priority”  
- [x] New Title (Unofficial): *The Most Irresponsible Responsible Adult* – as dubbed by Ensign Tashigi

---

Would you like to skip to your return to the palace infirmary, or rest with Tashigi present for one final post-mission moment?

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Arrive at the palace in the stretcher. Rumors of the Kiwi Knight being killed chasing Baroque agents float around.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna – Royal Palace, Outer Courtyard]**  
**Scene: “The Return of the Fallen(?)”**  
**POV: You (Stretcher-Bound), Tashigi (Beside You)**  
**Tone: Somber Arrival | Mood: Shifting from Grief to Confusion to Relief**

---

The **palace gates swing open**, and for a moment, the sun gleams dramatically over the domes and spires of the capital like a **hero’s last curtain call.**

Except the hero is on a **wooden stretcher**, bruised, bleeding, and swearing under his breath about **insurance coverage.**

---

**Rumors beat you to the palace.**

By the time the guards rush to receive you, a **buzz has rippled through the city’s recovery crews** and soldiers.

Whispers abound.

&gt; “He’s the one who summoned the elemental…”  
&gt; “They say he shielded Ensign Tashigi from a bomb—didn’t make it.”  
&gt; “I heard he went out like a knight. Didn’t even scream.”  
&gt; “What was his name again? Kii-something?”  
&gt; “Snackpack-sensei?”  
&gt; “No, *Pineapple-sama.*”  
&gt; “...Didn’t he work at a school?”  
&gt; “A *what?!*”

---

You catch fragments of the crowd, voices blending together like a surreal eulogy.

A Marine lieutenant starts saluting when he sees the stretcher.

A few palace medics **pause with visible surprise** when they realize you're—somehow—**still breathing.**

---

&gt; “Wait—he’s alive?”  
&gt; “That’s him? He’s not... juiced?”

One medic fumbles with a clipboard. Another drops his flask.

&gt; “He’s even making *jokes.*”

---

Tashigi walks beside the stretcher like a quiet specter, her hand still loosely resting on the frame. She says nothing to the gathering crowd, **eyes forward, jaw tight.**

But the **rumor tide doesn’t stop.**

Not even as the medics lift you inside.

Not even as the infirmary doors swing shut behind you.

---

**Inside the medical wing**, Vivi paces frantically beside your assigned bed, having just been briefed. Her eyes go wide as they wheel you in, and she bolts to your side.

&gt; “You’re not dead!!”

&gt; “Was hoping to keep that part a surprise,” you croak.  
&gt; “Didn’t want to spoil the ending.”

---

She leans down, brushing her fingers through your hair—not scolding, not teasing—just relief, raw and unfiltered.

Tashigi speaks quietly behind her.

&gt; “He shielded me. Took the worst of it.”

&gt; “Again?” Vivi mutters, brows knitting.  
&gt; “He’s going to keep doing this, isn’t he?”

&gt; “Unfortunately... yes,” Tashigi replies, her voice almost fond. Almost.

---

**OOC: The palace believes you nearly died.**

- Your legend among local soldiers, reconstruction teams, and even some young nobles has *intensified*.  
- Rumors range from heroic sacrifice to tragic romance to *you transforming into juice at will* (thanks, Snack Pack rumors).  
- The tale of the **Kiwi Knight**—a wandering bounty hunter who gave his life protecting a marine and a princess—is already **taking root in song.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Play dead a little longer. Ham it up. You're in too much pain to stop them.}  
2. {Insist you’re fine. “Not dead yet!” You want credit for surviving, damn it.}  
3. {Reach up, grab Vivi or Tashigi’s wrist, and make a quiet joke to lighten their relief.}

&gt;&gt; USER: ​Option 3 - you ladies really need to stop standing in front of explosives. It's become a bad habit.


OOC: Vivi heard rumors of my demise much before my arrival at the palace. Some descriptions more grisly than others.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace – Infirmary, Late Afternoon]**  
**Scene: “Rumors of My Juicing Have Been Greatly Exaggerated”**  
**POV: You (flat on your back), Vivi &amp; Tashigi (too relieved to punch you)**  
**Tone: Warm Reprieve | Mood: Emotive, Quiet Humor, Reconnection**

---

The bed creaks softly as you're lowered in by the medics, who murmur about bandages, salves, and trauma compression wraps. Your coat, half-burnt and citrus-splotched, is folded with mild reverence and placed aside like some kind of national artifact.

Meanwhile, **Tashigi stands guard like a silent sword at your bedside**, and **Vivi hasn't stopped gripping your forearm** since you were wheeled in. Her hand trembles, but she hasn't noticed—or maybe she has, and she just doesn't care.

You open one eye halfway. Enough to meet both of theirs.

Then, voice raspy but dry as the Alabastan wind, you croak:

&gt; “You ladies really need to stop standing in front of explosives...”

A beat.

&gt; “It’s become a *very* bad habit.”

---

**Tashigi stiffens.**

**Vivi gasps.**

And then—

&gt; “*YOU JERK!*” Vivi yells, her voice cracking.

She swats at your shoulder before remembering you're bandaged like a fruit-themed mummy.

&gt; “I thought you *died!* Do you know what I heard?! That you *exploded*! That there was nothing left but a puddle and a smile!”

&gt; “I heard you got vaporized trying to protect me,” Tashigi adds with unamused flatness.  
&gt; “Or melted into a permanent juice puddle and slid into the sewer.”

&gt; “...Well, that last one’s not completely off,” you mumble.

---

Vivi wipes at her eyes angrily, cheeks pink.

&gt; “There were *poets* outside the gates reciting lines about the fallen Kiwi Knight.”

&gt; “I nearly kicked one,” Tashigi says with a shrug.

---

You grin, wincing through the movement.

&gt; “Good. Let ‘em write it all down. But make sure they spell my name right on the statue.”

&gt; “Statue?!” Vivi yells again.

&gt; “...Statue,” Tashigi echoes, barely holding back a snort.

---

**OOC:**

- **Relationship scores with Vivi and Tashigi deepened.**  
  - Vivi: ~80/100 (Endearment, Trust, Deep Concern)  
  - Tashigi: ~78/100 (Loyalty, Guilt, Protective Instinct)

- **You are restricted to the infirmary for the rest of the day.**  
- Palace guards *still whisper rumors* that the real you may have died and been replaced with a wax figure or *“a very clever juice clone.”*

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask for news from the city. What’s the aftermath looking like post-Baroque?}  
2. {Ask for a snack. Preferably something that doesn’t look like citrus.}  
3. {Thank them—honestly—for being alive. For staying. For giving you someone worth protecting.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I could sure use something to eat. To fill up the big ol' hole in my back the bomb made.

OOC: Describe a detailed, long scene of Vivi before my arrival, rumors amok of my death saving some marine from an explosive demise.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Flashback Scene – Royal Palace, Three Hours Before Your Arrival]**  
**Location: Alubarna – Upper Garden Courtyard**  
**Characters: Vivi, Guards, Civilians, Rumors, Shadows of Truth**  
**Tone: Somber, Restless | Mood: A Princess Under Siege by Hope and Fear**

---

The garden courtyard of Alubarna—once a sanctuary of soft color and perfumed stillness—has become a place of uneasy whispers and **haunted footfalls**. The bougainvillea hang limp. The fountains murmur like mourners.

And Vivi stands there, **alone at first**, her arms wrapped tightly around her middle as the sky swells toward late afternoon.

The reports had started pouring in barely an hour ago.

&gt; “Explosive detonation. Sandstone depot.”  
&gt; “Two Marine operatives—one possibly injured. One unaccounted for.”  
&gt; “The bounty hunter. The... Kiwi man. He was shielding her.”

Vivi had **demanded names**, specifics. She got none.

Just fragments.

Just enough to **build a funeral from imagination.**

---

She paces.

Her slippers scuff gently across the red stone tiles as nobles and guards filter in and out around her, giving her space—but not silence. Never silence.

&gt; “They say he shielded her with his body. Just threw himself over the crate.”  
&gt; “He conjured that juice creature again, but it wasn’t enough.”  
&gt; “Left nothing but his baton.”  
&gt; “The Marine girl—barely conscious—was carried out by survivors.”  
&gt; “He stayed. Went down with the depot.”

Someone left a **pouch of kiwis** on a nearby bench. Out of respect.

She hasn't touched them.

---

**Tashigi hasn’t returned.**  
**You haven’t returned.**  
**Only the smoke from the depot had risen.**

---

A messenger boy—barely older than her younger self, really—had tried to cheer her up with an optimistic report:

&gt; “My uncle’s a sand-runner. He said he saw someone crawling through the dunes earlier—looked juiced up and muttering about taxes. Maybe it was him!”

She had smiled at that.

A weak, **paper-thin smile**, meant only to keep the boy from crumbling with her.

---

Then she had turned away, stepped behind one of the date palms, and **cried so quietly even the leaves didn’t hear her.**

---

&gt; *“I should have stood closer.”*  
&gt; *“I should have seen it.”*  
&gt; *“I should’ve been the one—”*

Her hands clenched so hard they left **crescent marks on her palms.**

Vivi, the princess. The survivor of Baroque Works. The infiltrator. The peacemaker. The symbol of the country reborn.

But **not even all that armor could stop the ache.**

---

And then—

Not long after the sun shifted angles in the sky—

The distant **gate guards shouted.**

The palace bell rang, not for attack or ceremony—

—but for **return.**

---

A stretcher.

Two guards.

One broken, sarcastic, juice-covered man giving finger-guns to the confused crowd.

And Tashigi walking beside him, face unreadable, grip white-knuckled on the rail.

---

Vivi had **run.**

No decorum.

No royal poise.

She’d **shoved two ministers aside** in the marble corridor, **scattered scrolls and shock** across the throne wing, and nearly **tripped on her own skirt rounding the infirmary hall.**

---

By the time she saw you, conscious, sarcastic, oozing in more ways than one—

She had to resist the urge to slap you **and cry into your shoulder at the same time.**

---

**[Flash Forward – Present, Infirmary Room]**

She holds your hand now.

You mutter between shallow breaths:

&gt; “I could really use something to eat. Fill up the big ol’ hole in my back that bomb made.”

She blinks, startled—like she’d forgotten you could still make jokes.

And then she laughs, softly.

&gt; “You’re ridiculous.”

She steps away, just long enough to bark at a startled aide:

&gt; “Get this man *food.* Preferably something **not** juice-based.”

---

**OOC: Vivi’s bond with you is now unshakeable.**  
She saw your death.  
She felt the grief.  
And she got you back.

And not even the World Government could take that from her now.

---

Would you like to continue the scene with Vivi and Tashigi, or rest quietly until food arrives?

&gt;&gt; USER: I sure this doesn't result in any chronic back pain. Hey, Tashigi-chan, your back feeling alright?

I talk airily, as if I weren't wrapped up in bandages like a moth's cocoon.

**POV: You (Cocooned), Tashigi (Flat-Stared), Vivi (Trying Not to Laugh)**  
**Tone: Lighthearted | Mood: Post-Crisis Whiplash, Found-Family Vibes**

---

Your voice floats lazily through the infirmary chamber, as if you weren’t currently **swaddled tighter than a noblewoman’s firstborn** in layers of antiseptic wraps, herbal poultices, and warm compresses.

&gt; “I *sure* hope this doesn’t result in any chronic back pain...”

You sigh dramatically, shifting about half an inch before groaning at the betrayal of your ribs.

&gt; “Hey, Tashigi-chan—*your* back feeling alright?”

---

There’s a pause.

You hear a choked sound from the right.

**Vivi is stifling a laugh**, her hand covering her mouth, trying to appear respectful. She's failing spectacularly.

Tashigi, however—

She stands just to your left, arms crossed.

And gives you the kind of look that **could’ve bent steel.**

---

&gt; “Mine’s fine,” she says flatly, “unlike someone who used it like a sandbag filled with fruit pulp.”

You grin up at her. You can’t see her, not from this angle, but you can feel her *glower* rolling over your cocooned form like a thundercloud with glasses.

&gt; “You’re welcome,” you chirp.

---

&gt; “You’re incorrigible,” she replies, stepping over and pressing a fresh, blessedly cold towel to your neck.

&gt; “And you’re terrible at accepting help.”

&gt; “I’m great at accepting breakfast,” you counter.

---

Vivi raises an eyebrow.

&gt; “You’re also apparently good at accepting near-death experiences. That’s what—third time?”

&gt; “Two and a half,” you mumble. “I wasn’t technically dead after the gator cannonball. Just *really inconvenienced.*”

---

A palace aide finally arrives with a silver tray laden with **warm honey bread, a small side of grilled spiced fish, dates, cheese**, and to your surprise—

&gt; “No kiwis?” you ask.

The aide blinks.

&gt; “...The princess gave *strict* orders.”

Vivi crosses her arms and nods proudly.

&gt; “I banned them from your diet. Medical reasons.”

---

**OOC: You’ve earned full recovery within 48 in-game hours.**

During this time, you can:

- Continue deepening relationships with key NPCs (Vivi, Tashigi, palace staff, Smoker)  
- Prepare for next steps (investigating Baroque remnants, the “402 NW” lead)  
- Explore the palace and interact with the increasingly colorful rumors around you  
- Or just... be a weird local hero with chronic back pain and a sense of civic duty.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask about any word from Smoker or Marine HQ. What’s the response to the depot bombing?}  
2. {Ask Vivi and Tashigi what they’ll do once things quiet down.}  
3. {Focus on eating. “Hero work’s hungry work.” Let them talk while you snack.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Enjoy the bread.

OOC - A long, detailed scene of Vivi and Tashigi contemplating recent events. When they were still fighting Crocodile, every disaster seemed normal. Manageable. But now that peace is returning, something like this... Stings. And the possibility of Eatone's death 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace – Adjacent Courtyard, Evening]**  
**Scene: “Aftermath Echoes”**  
**POV: Vivi &amp; Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Uneasy Calm, Emotional Vulnerability**  
**Setting: The sun is falling behind Alubarna’s western domes, casting long golden streaks through vine-draped colonnades. A low wind carries the scent of cactus blossoms and scorched masonry dust. The city breathes—but doesn’t quite exhale. Not yet.**

---

**The infirmary grows quiet**, your slow, steady chewing the only sound behind the thin curtains.

Warm bread. Honey drizzle. A faint sigh of satisfaction.  
**Eatone Cheng is, for now, safe.**

But outside the curtained ward, under the open arch of a crumbling terrace where vines curl around burned sandstone columns—two women stand in thoughtful silence.

**Vivi, in her modest desert-blue dress, arms crossed. Tashigi, in partial Marine uniform, her sword hanging loose at her side.**

They’ve fought warlords.

They’ve faced assassination squads.

They’ve stood at the cliff’s edge of **a nation's collapse.**

And yet—

---

&gt; “This felt... different,” Vivi finally says.

Her voice is soft. Not weak, but restrained—like a harpstring drawn too tight.

Tashigi doesn’t answer right away. Her eyes are fixed on the **pool of moonlight gathering beneath a statue**—the one of Queen Nefertari Lili. A symbol of long-lost courage and ancient burdens.

&gt; “It was smaller,” Tashigi says at last. “Quieter. Just a crate. Just two agents.”

&gt; “But if he hadn’t been there...”

&gt; “I would have died.”

Vivi flinches at how plainly Tashigi says it. There’s no bravado. No denial. No elaborate rationalization.

Just *truth*.

---

&gt; “I thought he was dead,” Vivi whispers. “I believed it. I *felt* it. Like someone had taken something—no. Someone. Someone I hadn’t even realized I’d come to count on.”

Her arms tighten around herself.

&gt; “It’s strange. When we were still fighting Crocodile, everything was chaos. The idea of someone dying felt... remote. I knew it was possible, but I *couldn't focus* on it. There was always another battle, another plot.”

She swallows hard, blinking into the fading light.

&gt; “But now that it’s quiet... now that we’ve won...”

&gt; “Every threat feels louder,” Tashigi finishes. “Sharper.”

---

They stand a moment in silence, letting the breeze roll over them, brushing away heat and grief that refuses to fully settle.

&gt; “You ever think about how he’s not like us?” Vivi asks suddenly.

&gt; “You mean *not legally allowed to hold a sword?*” Tashigi replies dryly.

Vivi gives a soft huff of a laugh, but shakes her head.

&gt; “I mean he’s not royalty. Not military. He’s not even really a bounty hunter. He’s just... a man. A teacher. Who got caught up in something that should never have touched his life.”

---

Tashigi closes her eyes. She remembers the feel of his grip on her waist right before the blast. The heat. The ring in her ears. The sickening moment where she was sure he was gone.

&gt; “He doesn’t act like a soldier,” she murmurs. “But he fights like someone who’s trying to protect something he doesn’t think he deserves to hold.”

&gt; “Or someone,” Vivi whispers.

---

Another long silence.

Then Vivi turns, slowly, her voice lower now.

&gt; “I’m glad he didn’t die.”

&gt; “...Me too.”

---

From behind the curtain, your voice drifts sleepily:

&gt; “Did I hear my name? Or is this just the honey bread talking...?”

---

Tashigi rolls her eyes with a sigh.

Vivi smiles, warmth returning like morning sun over the ruins.

&gt; “It’s definitely the bread.”

---

**OOC: Bond Event Unlocked – “Quiet Moments After the Storm”**  
- **Vivi:** Connection solidified. Emotional reliance deepening.  
- **Tashigi:** Trust hardened through crisis. Protective instincts have crystallized.  
- Their relationship with each other has also deepened—tied together by shared battle, mutual loss, and the man they nearly lost.

---

Would you like to continue from the infirmary the next morning, or explore a brief night scene first—perhaps dreams, or quiet conversations with either woman?

&gt;&gt; USER: Night Scene. I am peaceful asleep. Still looking like a burnt cocoon.

**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Tender, Reflective, Healing**

---

The moonlight streams through the **arched window**, casting soft silvers across the stone floor, where once only dust and firelight danced.

You lie still in your bed, your form wrapped in **so many bandages** you resemble some vaguely tropical-themed sarcophagus. Your hair is matted against the pillow, a patch of dried juice clinging to the corner of your jaw.

Your chest rises and falls in a steady rhythm—**a survivor’s breath**, deeper than it was when they first brought you in.

No twitching.

No groaning.

Just peace.

You don’t hear the **soft footfalls** that cross the room, sandal against stone, nor the **swish of a Marine coat** folding neatly onto a chair. You don’t feel the **presence at your bedside** settle in with a sigh.

But she’s there.

---

**Tashigi sits in the chair beside you**, legs crossed, her sword propped nearby but **not within immediate reach**—a rare vulnerability from a woman who sleeps with a hand on the hilt.

She watches you in silence.

The bandages on your face make you look **younger**, somehow. A little ridiculous. A little tragic. A lot brave.

&gt; “Still looks like he’s going to mutter something about paperwork,” she murmurs, half to herself.

She pulls a small cloth from her sleeve and gently, without waking you, **dabs a bit of dried juice from your cheek.**

---

In the stillness, **Vivi arrives not long after**, dressed in a pale robe, hair down over her shoulders. She pauses when she sees Tashigi already seated.

There’s a flicker of **mutual embarrassment**, and then—understanding.

No words.

She walks over and takes the other chair.

---

For a while, neither of them speak.

They simply sit—one princess, one soldier—listening to the quiet, feeling the **absence of bombs, blades, and barking orders.**

Feeling the **presence** of someone who should’ve died, and didn’t.

---

After a long moment, Tashigi speaks, her voice soft:

&gt; “He said I wasn’t allowed to die. That he’d save me, every time.”

Vivi looks at you, then at Tashigi.

&gt; “And yet he keeps almost dying *himself.*”

&gt; “Selfish idiot.”

&gt; “Big-hearted idiot.”

&gt; “...Yeah.”

---

They fall silent again.

The night deepens.

Your breathing never falters.

---

Eventually, **Tashigi’s head leans sideways**, resting lightly against the bed frame.

**Vivi leans forward**, folding her arms beside your pillow, forehead resting atop them, close enough to feel your warmth.

---

And so the cocooned man sleeps…

Surrounded by the two lives he saved.

And guarded, in silence, by those who now silently vow to protect *him.*

---

**OOC: Scene End.**  
Would you like to begin the next day with morning recovery—or a soft wake-up with visitors still nearby?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - dream of warmth. Also wake up feeling unusual sources of nearby warmth.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace – Infirmary, Dawnlight Filtering In]**  
**Scene: “Shared Heat”**  
**POV: You (Dreamer, Slowly Waking)**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Vulnerable, Soft, Faintly Embarrassing**

---

You drift, somewhere between sleep and sensation.

**No fire. No pain. No explosions.**

Just… **warmth.**

A soft cocoon of it, not just from the bandages, but *around* you. A memory of comfort—like an old classroom blanket, or a late afternoon sunbeam catching you asleep on a teacher’s lounge chair. There’s citrus in it, yes, but it’s mellow now. Reassuring. Homey.

And other things:

**The weight of silk. The faint scent of perfume. Leather, metal polish, and wildflowers.**

And then—movement.

Something shifts beside your pillow.

Another presence shifts near your arm.

**Both warm. Both real.**

---

Your eyelids peel open slowly, blinking against the morning haze. The light isn’t blinding—it’s **soft**, filtered through gauze curtains fluttering gently in the dawn breeze.

You don’t remember falling asleep this peacefully.

And yet… you haven’t woken alone.

---

To your immediate left, resting with uncharacteristic vulnerability, **Tashigi’s head lies slumped near your shoulder**, tucked just against the crook of your arm. One of her hands is gently curled against her jacket, her **glasses slightly askew**, hair uncharacteristically down and **resting against your bicep.**

To your right, curled halfway on the bed, her arms folded gently atop the edge of the mattress, **Vivi breathes slowly**, her cheek pressed against her forearm, hair like a curtain across her eyes. She murmurs something unintelligible in her sleep—a twitch of a smile crossing her face.

---

You freeze.

The heat from both sides is unmistakable.  
So is the way they’re **unconsciously leaning in**—seeking warmth. Or something more.

And you… are **the warmth.**

---

&gt; “...Okay,” you whisper hoarsely to no one.  
&gt; “Definitely not dead. This is way too cozy for hell.”

Your ribs groan a little when you shift.

Neither of them stirs.

---

For one perfect moment, you’re **held in place not by wounds—but by affection**.

And despite the aching, the scars, the months of blood and sweat and citrus…

**You don’t move.**

You just lie there.

And let yourself be cared for.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Stay still and quietly enjoy it. Let them wake naturally.}  
2. {Try to slowly, delicately sit up… and likely disturb both.}  
3. {Say something. A joke. A whisper. Something to mark this moment.}</pre>
