Arriving in Rainbase: Crocodile's Plan Unveiled
Before we begin, please summarize this portion of the Alabasta arc from One Piece canon, as Vivi and the Straw Hats just arrive in Rainbase, while Crocodile delegates missions to his Baroque Works Office Agents of their respective tasks for the final takeover of Alabasta. The Straw Hats have not entered Rain Dinners yet. Then load it into your memory. You may go over the 5000 word limit for this summary.

Do not place my character in yet.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **Initializing RPG-Bot. Game Loaded: *Fate Core System*. Theme: *One Piece: Grand Adventure*. Tonality: *Action-Packed*. Role: *Storyteller*.**

Scenario acknowledged: *Mid-Alabasta Arc - Arrival in Rainbase, Before Straw Hats Enter Rain Dinners.*

**ð Canonical Summary - One Piece: Alabasta Arc | Act III: Rainbase, Crocodile's Plan Unveiled**

---

**Setting the Stage: Alabasta's Crisis**

The desert kingdom of **Alabasta** stands on the edge of civil war. Once a thriving monarchy under **King Nefertari Cobra**, the kingdom is now fractured by unrest, drought, and rebellion. The people blame their monarch for the country's suffering, while the true mastermind behind the chaos remains hidden in the shadows-**Sir Crocodile**, one of the Seven Warlords of the Sea and the president of the secret criminal organization **Baroque Works**.

Under the codename **Mr. 0**, Crocodile has manipulated events across Alabasta, orchestrating a coup d'Ã©tat using subterfuge, misinformation, and assassinations. His ultimate goal is the **Poneglyph** hidden beneath **Alubarna**, which he believes will grant him the **Pluton**, an ancient weapon of mass destruction.

---

**Rainbase: The City of Dreams**

At the edge of the desert lies **Rainbase**, a coastal resort city and gambling mecca. The city houses **Rain Dinners**, a grand casino operated-and secretly fortified-by Crocodile. It doubles as Baroque Works' regional command center. Protected by canals and traps, Rain Dinners is nearly impenetrable to the average citizen or pirate, and serves as Crocodile's temporary base of operations during this phase of his plan.

The city's tone is paradoxical: vibrant on the surface with laughing tourists and gleaming towers, but humming underneath with tension, corruption, and secrets. Navy presence is weak, thanks to Crocodile's *&quot;heroic&quot;* status among the public for supposedly defending Alabasta from pirates.

---

**The Straw Hats Arrive**

After a grueling trek through the desert and an emotionally volatile reunion with **Ace**, **Monkey D. Luffy** and his crew finally reach Rainbase alongside **Princess Nefertari Vivi**. Their objective: confront Crocodile and put a stop to the rebellion before the kingdom falls apart. Unbeknownst to them, Crocodile is not only aware of their arrival-he has anticipated it.

Vivi is fraught with worry. The revolution has reached its boiling point, and she knows time is running out. The Straw Hats, battered by the desert, are still determined to protect her and the people of Alabasta. They're not seeking treasure or fame here-this is personal.

As they approach Rain Dinners, the crew splits: **Luffy**, **Vivi**, **Zoro**, **Nami**, **Usopp**, and **Chopper** go directly toward the casino. Meanwhile, **Sanji** is left behind to find another entrance after being told to stay hidden, giving him a chance to move separately and avoid detection by Crocodile's forces.

---

**Baroque Works: Plans in Motion**

Inside Rain Dinners, **Crocodile**, ever calm and composed, sits at the apex of a grand strategy meeting with his top agents: **Miss All Sunday**, **Mr. 1**, **Miss Doublefinger**, **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**, **Mr. 3** (believed dead), and various lower-ranked agents. His tone is precise, his demeanor cold. He details the final stages of the plan:

- **Operation Utopia** is to begin.
- The **Royal Army** and the **Rebel Army**, manipulated through false flag attacks and propaganda, are to clash in **Alubarna**, the capital city.
- Crocodile will eliminate King Cobra, seize the throne, and acquire the ancient weapon.

Each Baroque Works agent is assigned a mission:
- **Mr. 1 &amp; Miss Doublefinger**: Eliminate King Cobra and seize Alubarna.
- **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**: Impersonate King Cobra using his **Clone-Clone Fruit** to further destabilize the monarchy.
- **Mr. 4 &amp; Miss Merry Christmas** (en route): Lead a sabotage mission within the rebel lines.
- **Mr. 3**: Presumed missing or dead (Crocodile is not aware he survived Little Garden), his failure has forced contingency plans.

**Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin)** remains enigmatic-her loyalty to Crocodile seems secure, but her motivations are veiled. Her role is to guide Crocodile to the Poneglyph once it is uncovered.

Crocodile gives a final, chilling order: capture or kill the Straw Hats and Vivi, should they interfere again.

---

**The Trap is Set**

Rain Dinners has been prepped for intruders. Inside its glitzy halls and behind its slot machines lie deadly secrets:
- **Banana Gators**, monstrous creatures, patrol the underground prison chamber.
- Entire corridors are designed to collapse, flood, or trap.
- The main chamber has a **Seastone Cage**, meant to capture Devil Fruit users.

Crocodile prepares to personally confront any Straw Hats foolish enough to challenge him-especially Luffy. He remains confident, believing that no one in Alabasta, not even the Marine forces, can stop his plan now.

---

**Marine Presence**

**Captain Tashigi** and **Smoker** of the Marines are also in Rainbase, quietly pursuing leads on Crocodile and Baroque Works. However, the Warlord system complicates their pursuit; Smoker is forced to operate unofficially, knowing the World Government shields Crocodile from prosecution. Still, they've intercepted intelligence hinting that the Straw Hats are also targeting Crocodile-and might become unlikely allies.

They, too, plan to infiltrate Rain Dinners.

---

**Timeline Sync Point**

The Straw Hats are just outside Rain Dinners. Sanji is separated. Vivi is anxious. Luffy is enraged. Crocodile is ready.

Rainbase hums with neon energy and hidden danger. The storm that will determine the fate of Alabasta is about to break.

---

**Rainbase Features:**

- **Rain Dinners Casino:** Opulent gambling palace and Baroque Works HQ. Has underground prisons and Seastone cells.
- **Canals &amp; Riverfronts:** Gator-filled waters surround the city. Fast water travel available.
- **Shady Alley Markets:** Home to bounty brokers, arms dealers, and spice smugglers.
- **Rainbar Inn:** Common hub for travelers and rogues alike.

- **Marine Outpost (Secret):** Smoker and Tashigi's base of operations, hidden among the warehouses near the docks.

---

**Notable NPCs Active in Rainbase:**

- **Sir Crocodile (Mr. 0):** Cold, calculated, and cruel. Master of the Suna Suna no Mi (Sand-Sand Fruit).
- **Nico Robin (Miss All Sunday):** Intelligent, secretive, and dangerous. Knows how to read Poneglyphs.
- **Mr. 1 (Daz Bones):** Ruthless assassin with the Supa Supa no Mi (Steel Blade Fruit).
- **Mr. 2 Bon Clay:** Mercurial and theatrical, but a deadly fighter.
- **Captain Smoker:** Lawful and relentless. Smokes two cigars at once.
- **Tashigi:** Justice-driven, slightly clumsy, and determined to bring down Baroque Works.

**Loaded to Memory: Rainbase Canonical Events (Pre-Rain Dinners Infiltration)**  
You may now introduce CHARACTER: *Eatone*. Let me know when you're ready to begin.

&gt;&gt; USER: It's summer break at the school I teach at right now, and I feel like it's a good time as any to treat myself. After reading through a travel brochure, I was led to Rain Dinners, rated the #1 resort in Alabasta. The rumors of political unrest are slightly worrying, but the unusually low prices for the stay (probably due to the unrest) were too good to pass up. I step off a tourist's barge and enter Rainbase, following chintzy signs directing me towards the opulent casino.

I may or may not notice a character(s) of interest sneaking through the city.

OOC: My character knows little to nothing about Alabasta's politics, the Straw Hats, Baroque Works, or Crocodile.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð Summer in the Sands - Session Start: Rainbase Arrival**  
**ð² RPG-Bot Active | World: One Piece - Grand Line**  
**ð§ Character: Eatone | Bounty Hunter, Secondary School Teacher | Kiwi Juice-Juice Fruit User**  
**ð Location: Rainbase, Alabasta | Time: Late Afternoon | Weather: Sweltering Heat, Desert Winds with Rare Breezes off the Canal**

---

The blazing Alabastan sun beats down like a celestial furnace as your **tourist barge** glides lazily through the turquoise canal threading through **Rainbase**. Towering sandstone buildings adorned with **gaudy golden fixtures** rise around you, their silhouettes hazy with the heat shimmer. As the boat nears the Rainbase dock, you're greeted by a **steel drum band** made up of bored-looking musicians in floral shirts, half-heartedly playing a tune titled *&quot;A Gamble in the Dunes.&quot;*

A **mascot gator** in a casino uniform waves you in with robotic cheer-one of **Rain Dinners'** many marketing ploys.

You step off the barge. Your boots hit sun-bleached stone. The city's humid air is thick with spice, sweat, and sea mist. Neon signs flicker in lazy loops, advertising everything from &quot;5-Berri Blackjack Tables&quot; to &quot;World-Famous Banana Gator Shows!&quot; You clutch the **folded Rain Dinners brochure** you picked up at a ferry station earlier. &quot;Five stars!&quot; it had said. &quot;Family-friendly fun and exciting nightlife, under the protection of the Hero of the Dunes himself!&quot;

You're here for **rest**, maybe a little adventure, and-if the opportunity presents itself-a nice, low-risk bounty or two.

&gt; But something doesn't sit quite right.

Despite the music and the promo-glitz, there's a subtle, sour **nervousness in the air**. Armed casino guards with *Baroque Works* emblems tuck themselves into the shadows of every alley. **Locals avoid eye contact.** Tourists? Fewer than you expected. Many street stalls have shuttered early, and merchants whisper with wary glances at the opulent casino at the city's heart-**Rain Dinners**, a glittering tower adorned with rotating golden crocodile statues.

As you follow the signs toward the main resort entrance, you momentarily catch sight of **a small group of individuals slipping quietly down a side alley**. Their movements are quick, practiced-too deliberate for drunk tourists. One of them wears a **straw hat**. Another has a **long green sword at his hip**. A blue-nosed animal waddles behind them wearing a backpack.

You blink, but they vanish behind a corner. No one else seems to notice-or care.

---

**LOCATION: Rainbase - Entry Plaza**
- **Rain Dinners Main Gate**: A wide arch flanked by lavish fountains spewing mist into the air. A **lounge singer** croons an Alabastan jazz melody from a stage inside the lobby.
- **Side Alley (Just Passed)**: The figures went this way. Dimly lit, partially blocked by crates.
- **Canal Boardwalk**: Leads to merchant ships and shady taverns. The rain glimmers on the cobblestones.
- **Observation Gator Tower**: A tourist attraction-ride a Banana Gator-shaped elevator up to see the desert!
- **Local Bounty Board**: Near a post office, tucked between ads for sand lotion and drink coupons.

---

**You are wearing:**
- A light tan jacket (sleeves rolled up), slacks, and comfortable sandals.
- Over one shoulder, a cross-body bag with bounty hunter credentials tucked *behind* your teacher ID.

**You are carrying:**
- A reusable juice canteen
- A compact bounty hunter's Den Den Mushi (off)
- Some extra cash, drink tickets, and Rain Dinners coupons
- A small teaching notebook with lessons half-scribbled on heatstroke prevention and desert ecosystem ecology

---

**What would you like to do?**

1. {Keep walking toward Rain Dinners, play the oblivious tourist, and enjoy a free fruit cocktail.}
2. {Head down the alley to see what the mysterious group is doing-it could be nothing, or it could be a juicy lead.}
3. {Stop by the bounty board. See if there's any easy, low-risk bounties to nab while on &quot;vacation.&quot;}
4. {Use a discreet Kiwi Juice probe technique (a spritz under the soles of your feet to stealthily track moisture trails) to follow the group without being noticed.}
5. {Do something completely idiotic but potentially brilliant: step up onto a table and loudly call out, &quot;HEY! IS THAT A TALKING DEER?&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Eh...? As a frequent traveler, I know the best sights are often off the beaten path. Perhaps they're heading towards a little-known hole-in-the-wall kebab place.

OOC: My main weapon is an expandable baton with a Seastone tip, purchased tearfully after many months of saved teacher's wages.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Action Selected: Option 2 - &quot;Eh...? Could be a kebab spot.&quot;**  
**ð¬ Passive Ability Activated: Responsible Adult Instinct - *&quot;That group looked like they were up to something... or maybe just hungry. I should at least check it out. Quietly.&quot;***  
**ð§ Equipment Updated: Expandable Seastone Baton - Carried in an inner pocket of your travel jacket.**

---

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rainbase - Side Alley Behind the Glitter**

The main promenade fades behind you as you slip off the main path and into the **side alley**, the brightness of the desert sun giving way to half-shadow and filtered light bouncing off stacked crates of casino supplies-**fake coins, glittery feather boas, barrels of juice syrup (some inferior imposter Kiwi, you note with disdain)**.

Your sandals crunch over discarded betting slips and spice wrappers. The alley narrows, curving gently, eventually opening onto a **forgotten street** behind the Rain Dinners compound-one only **locals or sneak-savvy veterans** would know about. There's a single rusty lantern hung from a bent pole above the archway, fluttering with paper ads in Alabastan script: **&quot;Wanted: Delivery Boy - Must Not Ask Questions.&quot;**

Ahead, you catch them again-**that same group**, slipping silently past a **caged Banana Gator pen**, now moving even more cautiously. One figure-a short woman with tangerine-colored hair and a confident stride-turns briefly and scans the area. You freeze behind a crate, holding your breath. She seems to look right through you... then keeps moving.

Their body language is telling:
- The **swordsman** is keeping rear guard.
- The **blue-nosed reindeer** has changed shape-now walking upright like a human, muttering nervously.
- The **young man in the straw hat** is walking up front, arms crossed, looking fired up, but oddly... hungry.

They clearly don't want to be seen. And they definitely aren't tourists.

You edge closer, one hand brushing your coat pocket, resting over the cool, weighty feel of your **Seastone Baton**, just in case.

Then-**a whisper, from behind you.**

&gt; &quot;Yo. You new in town too, musclehead-sensei?&quot;

You spin.

A figure leans against the alley wall, half-hidden by shadow. A man dressed flamboyantly in a pink-and-blue swan coat, **dancer's slippers** on his feet, and heavy makeup around his eyes.

He bows-dramatically.

&gt; &quot;**Mr. 2 Bon Clay, at your fabulous service!** Don't mind me, just people-watching. Funny thing about people... they're so good at sneaking but *so bad at hiding!* Teehee!&quot;

His eyes narrow. He tilts his head, lips pursed like he's holding back something *juicy*.

&gt; &quot;And here you are, little sidewinder. Out of uniform, off the books, and in the thick of the biggest party in the kingdom. Curious~. Say... who're you here to see?&quot;

You get the feeling this guy *knows more than he's saying.* He's testing you. Flamboyant, but no fool.

---

**NPC Engaged: Mr. 2 Bon Clay**  
**Known Traits: Clone-Clone Fruit user, deceptive, flamboyant, unpredictable**  
**Hidden Traits: ???**  
**Secret: He is observing the Straw Hats under Crocodile's orders-but might not be entirely loyal to Crocodile's cause.**  

---

**Time: Late Afternoon**  
**Weather: Cooling slightly; breeze from the canal picking up dust**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Feign ignorance. &quot;Just sightseeing. Is this where the kebab place is?&quot; Play dumb and extract info from Bon Clay.}
2. {Pretend to know who he is, butter him up, and ask if he's heading to Rain Dinners. Try to get him talking.}
3. {Casually mention the group you saw, see how he reacts. Risky, but might give you leverage.}
4. {Politely excuse yourself and try to tail the group further. Might require stealth check.}
5. {Lie. Tell him you're undercover security from the resort. Roll to bluff.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - You... you know me? I look him up and down. Are you one of the parents of my kids? I pull out my notebook and ruffle through the class roster, looking for someone with the last name of 'Clay'

(Honest)

OOC: I teach at a school in another Kingdom, also in the Grand Line.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Action Selected: Option X - Honest Confusion**  
**ð&shy; Social Check: Honesty vs. Suspicion**  
**(Rolling for Mr. 2 Bon Clay's Insight - result: 4 on the ladder [Fair])**  
**(Rolling for Eatone's Honesty + Role as Teacher - result: 6 on the ladder [Great])**  
**â Outcome: SUCCESS - Bon Clay is caught off guard.**

---

The alley hangs in a moment of awkward stillness.

You tilt your head, expression *genuinely confused*, squinting at the theatrical man with a look halfway between recognition and concern.

&gt; &quot;You... you know me?&quot;

You begin rummaging through your **notebook**, flipping past diagrams of sandstorms and a half-sketched kiwi juice cooling system. Bon Clay blinks as you scan page after page of rosters, class projects, and notes written in your tiny, educator's handwriting.

&gt; &quot;Are you... one of the parents of my kids?&quot; you ask, eyes flicking up. &quot;Wait-Clay, Clay, Clay... no... Clancy? Clive? Clarence...&quot;

You trace a finger down the list like you're doing a parent-teacher conference audit.

Bon Clay's jaw slackens ever so slightly. His posture wavers. It's the kind of deeply disarming honesty that hits with the subtlety of a cannonball made of awkwardness.

&gt; &quot;Whaaat-!? PFFFT-AHAHA! *What even is this?!* You're not bluffing? You're seriously just some nobody schoolteacher? Bounty hunter-slash-teacher? What is this, a desert sitcom!?&quot;

He throws his arms up in a twirl and lets out a **shriek of giddy laughter**, staggering back and nearly knocking over a crate of glitter-bombs (which mercifully do *not* detonate). His guard drops like a sandbag off a camel cart.

&gt; &quot;Ohhhh I *like* you already, honeybun. No, I am *not* a parent. Probably couldn't hold a steady relationship long enough to raise a fish, let alone a child. But Clay would be a fabulous last name, wouldn't it? âLittle Clay Junior, back from dance class!' Aww~&quot;

He leans in again, a bit closer this time, but with genuine intrigue.

&gt; &quot;So what *is* a schoolteacher doing here in Croco-land, hmm? Don't tell me you're here to collect one of the *big bounties*... unless...&quot;

His voice drops. His eyes flicker toward the direction the group vanished, just beyond a tall fence lined with tourist banners for &quot;The Banana Gator Spectacular.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...unless you're tailing that group too. The ones with the antlers and the abs.&quot;

---

Bon Clay seems amused by you, and you've successfully **lowered his guard** for now. Your honesty reads as *so ridiculous*, it's completely believable. You've bought yourself some space to either dig for info-or slip away.

Your instincts tingle. Something in his tone... the way he said &quot;Croco-land&quot;... He might be bluffing about his role here. He's fishing. Hard.

---

**NPC Status: Bon Clay - Open, Talkative, Emotionally Tilted Toward You (currently Friendly)**  
**ð§ Eatone Status: Unharmed | Baton: Hidden | Juices: Stable &amp; Cool**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Keep playing the honest tourist-teacher. Ask him what's going on in the city-especially about that group. See how far this act gets you.}
2. {Come clean: &quot;Okay, part-time teacher, part-time bounty hunter. And I smell something fishy.&quot; Try to build a rapport based on shared weirdness.}
3. {Deflect completely: ask about *his* shoes, his outfit, or start talking about school dance recitals. Maybe make a friend out of this?}
4. {Politely excuse yourself, &quot;gotta check on my travel companion,&quot; and try to catch up to the mysterious group.}
5. {Go bold: invite Bon Clay to lunch at the kebab stall you're now 20% sure exists. Who knows, maybe this weird man is a lead-or a future ally.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I hold up my printed-out confirmation for a 5-night stay at Rain Dinners. Sorry sir, I'm off the clock. Just here for pleasure. I saw that strange group sneaking around, wasn't sure if they were locals heading to a hidden hole-in-the-wall kebab shop, or criminals. Figured I'd make sure either way.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;I'm off the clock. Just here for pleasure.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Social Roll: Honest Confession + Mild Suspicion + Disarming Humor**  
**(Eatone's Roll: +2 Empathy +1 Rapport - Result: 5 [Great])**  
**(Bon Clay's Roll: -1 Distracted +3 Cunning - Result: 4 [Good])**  
**â Outcome: SUCCESS - Bon Clay opens up further, still suspicious, but charmed**

---

You pull out a slightly crumpled, sweat-dampened **paper voucher**, marked in bright pink ink:  
**&quot;CONFIRMED - 5-NIGHT LUXURY PACKAGE, RAIN DINNERS. Includes: Welcome Cocktail, VIP Spa Soak, Complimentary Gator Show Seating.&quot;**

Bon Clay blinks.

You shrug, **offering a sheepish smile**, as if to say *&quot;yeah, I came for the pool, not the politics.&quot;*

&gt; &quot;Sorry sir, I'm off the clock. Just here for pleasure. Saw that strange group sneaking around. Wasn't sure if they were heading to some hole-in-the-wall kebab shop or...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;...you know. Criminals. Figured I'd make sure either way.&quot;

Bon Clay stares at you for a beat... and then laughs again, softer this time, more genuine.

&gt; &quot;Pfft-oh *bless your juicy heart!* You remind me of a desert bird with no sense of direction but a great sense of style. What are you, *Kiwi-scented with a badge?* Ha! You really *are* something else.&quot;

He folds his arms, eyeing the voucher like it's a contract to your soul.

&gt; &quot;Rain Dinners, huh? Well... funny you should mention that group. Because, get this: that little deer guy? *Not a costume.* And the one with the hat? Word on the grapevine is that he once punched a Sea King in the *gums.*&quot;

He leans in, suddenly serious.

&gt; &quot;And you didn't hear this from me-but if you're planning to stay in that glitzy casino of deathtrap-y doom... watch your back.&quot;

A pause. His tone shifts. Dramatically.

&gt; &quot;*Things are going to get dramatic soon.* Rain Dinners isn't just a resort. It's the staging ground for the biggest heist, coup, or catastrophe this kingdom's seen in decades.&quot;

Then, with a wink and a flourish, he pulls a **folding fan** from seemingly nowhere, slaps it open, and waves himself down.

&gt; &quot;But what do *I* know? I'm just a lonely dancer looking for love and dessert in a war-torn country.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;...Also I *highly recommend* the curry gator kebabs down by the west docks. Not fancy, but *oof* the spice is to *die* for. Maybe I'll see you there~&quot;

And with that, Bon Clay twirls on his heel, leaving a puff of glitter in the air, and flutters down the alley in the opposite direction of the group you'd spotted.

---

**ð Info Gained:**

- Bon Clay recognizes the group as **dangerous outsiders**, specifically mentioning the &quot;deer&quot; and &quot;hat-wearing one.&quot;
- He *knows* something is about to go down at Rain Dinners.
- He suspects you're not entirely what you appear to be-but he likes you.
- The **curry gator kebab stand** may actually be real (West Docks, open evenings).

---

**Time: Early Evening - Sun beginning to dip behind Rainbase's casino skyline**  
**Weather: Still hot, but cooling. Sand blowing lightly on wind currents. Tourists heading indoors.**

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head back toward the main Rain Dinners entrance. Keep up the tourist act, check in to your room, and quietly scope the place.}
2. {Follow the mysterious group from a distance. You've confirmed they're no kebab-seekers. Time to see what they're really after.}
3. {Detour toward the west docks. Visit the kebab stand. Maybe someone there is worth talking to-or maybe Bon Clay left a message.}
4. {Contact a bounty hunter connection via Den Den Mushi. Get a pulse on local contract rumors around Rainbase.}
5. {Head to the Marine warehouse near the docks. You've heard whispers they have a secret outpost here-worth a poke?}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - I... what? What's that about a death-trap? I thought Rain Dinners was family friendly! Call my good pal (A junior Marine officer) in my home-island's bounty office, and ask if he's heard anything about Rain Dinners.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 4 Selected - &quot;What do you mean *death-trap*?!&quot;**  
**ð Contacting: Junior Marine Officer - Bounty Office, Your Home Island (Name: Enzo)**  
**ð&shy; Social Check - Casual Inquiry with Urgency (Eatone Rapport +2, Enzo's Loyalty +3) = Result: SUCCESS**

---

You stare down the alley Bon Clay vanished into, blinking like someone just told you your favorite juice brand funds pirates. You glance at your **Rain Dinners voucher** again, the glittery letters now reading more like a *warning label* than a promotion.

&gt; *&quot;I thought this place was family-friendly...&quot;*

A single bead of sweat rolls down your cheek. It's not from the heat.

With a sigh, you slide your hand into your side satchel and pull out your **compact Den Den Mushi**, a smaller model commonly used by freelance bounty hunters on limited budgets. It twitches awake sleepily, little snail eyes blinking.

&gt; &quot;T'zzzt... Hello?&quot;

You flip open your notebook to a folded page marked **âTrustworthy Contacts - Marine Side'**, and tap the entry labeled:

**Lt. (Jr.) Enzo Bellamo - Bounty Office Liaison, North Bridge Precinct**  
**&quot;Likes: Hot gossip, hates: being woken up before noon.&quot;**

You twist the dial. The Den Den's face morphs into **Enzo's sleepy-eyed snail likeness**, complete with oversized reading glasses and a half-eaten rice ball.

&gt; **&quot;Eatoooone?&quot;** he slurs, voice half-asleep. &quot;Bro, I told you last time: I can't do anything about vacation pay being taxed. What is it now?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Enzo,&quot; you say quickly, stepping deeper into the alley for privacy, &quot;Rain Dinners. Alabasta. Ever hear of it being a *death-trap?* I booked a 5-night stay.&quot;

There's a *long pause*.

You hear rustling paper. Then-rapid-fire shuffling.

&gt; &quot;Wait, Rain Dinners? Like... *the casino* Rain Dinners?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yeah, the one with the complimentary cocktails and Banana Gator show.&quot;

&gt; &quot;HOLY JUICEBOXES, *EATONE, GET OUTTA THERE!*&quot;

The snail nearly bounces out of your palm.

&gt; &quot;Bro, I dunno if this is official intel or just smoke in the ranks, but I've heard some *serious crap* about that place. A couple of mid-level Baroque Works agents were intercepted near Loguetown two months ago. Talked in their sleep. Said Rain Dinners is a **front**. Like, whole operation-a warlord's nest or something.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Which warlord?&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's the scary part-**they didn't say.** The officers clammed up after a Cipher Pol agent got involved.&quot;

You whistle low.

&gt; &quot;Listen, I can't file anything without getting demoted, but between you and me? **Pull out if you can.** Lay low, don't mention your Devil Fruit, and if anyone offers you a *banana cocktail with a funny aftertaste*, **run.** Oh-and one last thing.&quot;

There's a shuffling sound. He lowers his voice.

&gt; &quot;A Marine captain and a sword-girl went missing in that area a day ago. Unofficial. Not confirmed dead.&quot;

The line *clicks*-and Enzo's snail yawns, muttering, &quot;Good luck, bro,&quot; before powering down.

---

**ð Info Gained:**

- **Rain Dinners is suspected of being a front for a powerful Warlord.**
- Cipher Pol has interfered in keeping intel buried.
- **A Marine captain and officer (likely Smoker and Tashigi)** have disappeared recently in the region.
- **Banana cocktails might be laced with something**-possibly tranquilizers or poisons used on Devil Fruit users.
- **Baroque Works agents** use Rain Dinners as a safehouse.

---

**Time: Early Evening | Light dimming, neon signs flickering on**  
**Location: Side Alley behind Rain Dinners, near Banana Gator exhibit**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Proceed to check in to Rain Dinners-*but with maximum caution*. Activate all teacher instincts and keep your juice sense primed.}
2. {Rush to follow the group from earlier. If they're trying to take down Rain Dinners, they might be your best chance at survival.}
3. {Visit the kebab stand-play it off like a tourist, maybe gather more rumors from locals off the casino payroll.}
4. {Try to find the missing Marine duo. Head toward the dockside warehouses, where you suspect a hidden outpost could be.}
5. {Leave Rainbase. This vacation is officially cursed. Catch the next barge out. (*May result in XP loss due to unfinished arc*)}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I... Eh? What the hell is going on here? Rain Dinners has a 4.9 star rating on the World Economy News Paper! Why is everyone freaking out about it? Whatever, I'm getting my damn complimentary drink one way or the other. If I smell trouble, I'm riding a Kiwi-juice waterfall straight out the balcony.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;4.9 Stars? Then I'm cashing in.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Social Stance: Alert Tourist | Inner Monologue: *&quot;When in doubt, drink juice and stay near the exits.&quot;***  
**ð¹ Goal: Check into Rain Dinners, claim complimentary drink, maintain tactical awareness**  
**ð§ Devil Fruit Readiness: Kiuikyuui JÅ«su JÅ«su no Mi (Kiwi Juice-Juice Fruit) - Primed for escape cascade**

---

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rain Dinners Main Lobby - Rainbase, Alabasta**  
**Time: Twilight, early evening | Weather: Dry, warm desert breeze | Atmosphere: Opulent, suspiciously sterile**

---

You step from alley to avenue, shaking the sand from your sandals like a man determined to enjoy **at least one damn perk** of his hard-earned summer break.

Rain Dinners looms ahead: a towering casino-temple of **gleaming glass and sun-bleached gold**, with neon crocs slowly rotating above the main gate like **guardians of gluttony**. Every brick of the place screams *luxury meets ominous cult headquarters*.

The glass doors open with a hiss of cool, artificially moist air. Your face is instantly hit by a **mist of fruit-scented humidity**-ironically, not kiwi.

&gt; *Strike one.*

Inside, the **main lobby** sparkles with light. Dozens of **slot machines chime and ding** in hypnotic rhythm. **Tourists in floral shirts** clutch coin trays and spill drinks on velvet carpets. Above it all, a mural depicts **a heroic figure made of sand** holding a goblet aloft, with the words: *&quot;RAIN DRAWS ALL FORTUNES TO SHORE.&quot;*

There are **no visible exits** except the way you came. Hmm.

A **uniformed hostess** approaches, wearing too much mascara and an unsettlingly wide smile.

&gt; &quot;Welcome, traveler! May I take your voucher?&quot;

You hand it over, trying to look both casual and **ready to flip a juice-fueled backflip** if necessary.

She scans the slip, nods, and waves a **Banana Gator valet** forward-wearing a bowtie, naturally. It grabs your luggage (a single backpack with your sandals, baton, and backup worksheets) and hurries off. She hands you a small token marked **&quot;COMPLIMENTARY DRINK - 1 USE ONLY.&quot;**

&gt; &quot;Please enjoy your time in Rain Dinners. We hope your fortune blooms in the desert winds~&quot;

She bows and vanishes as fast as she came. Not weird at all.

---

**You are now inside: Rain Dinners - Main Floor**

ð *Current areas visible:*

- **Complimentary Bar Lounge**: A lavish, semi-circular bar with lounge seating and a jazz band playing faintly. There's a strange scent to the air-**a mix of perfumes and sea salt**, with a faint hint of... tranquilizer?  
- **Gaming Floor**: Rows of tables-blackjack, dice games, and some weird Alabastan variation of pachinko.  
- **Elevators to Guest Suites**: Guarded by stoic bouncers in white suits with **gold crocodile pins.**  
- **Banana Gator Aquarium**: A massive tank at the far wall-creatures slosh around in dim blue light, their eyes *very* intelligent.

**You feel watched. But not by any one person. The whole building feels like it's listening.**

You take a seat at the bar, token in hand. A bartender with a curled mustache approaches.

&gt; &quot;What's your poison, sir?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;May I recommend the **Rain Delight**-banana-kiwi-coconut, with a *special touch* from the head chef?&quot;

---

**Devil Fruit Passive Activated: Kiwi Juice-Olfactory Sensory Scan**  
*(Sniff test roll - Eatone's fruit instinct +1, cleverness +1 = Result: 3 [Good])*

Your nose twitches. Your senses hone in.

**That &quot;Rain Delight&quot; has a trace amount of seastone powder or sea prism ash-something subtle but potent.** Probably wouldn't kill you... but enough to weaken a Devil Fruit user like yourself.

You glance to your side. Two tourists are already sipping the drink. One is blinking slowly. The other... is snoring upright.

&gt; *Strike two.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Accept the drink, pretend to sip, then discreetly dump it into a decorative vase. Play along, stay under the radar.}
2. {Ask for something off-menu. &quot;Just kiwi juice, thanks.&quot; See how the bartender reacts.}
3. {Stand up, ask loudly: &quot;Hey, anyone else feel dizzy, or is that just the banana funk in the air?&quot; Risk drawing attention, but might spark a scene.}
4. {Excuse yourself and follow the Banana Gator valet. You want to keep eyes on your luggage and make sure your suite is secure.}
5. {Initiate escape plan: create a thin kiwi-juice waterfall along the floor near the bar, ready to activate at a moment's notice. Just in case.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Also ask if he has any Kebab restaurant recommendations.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Complimentary Drink? Cheers, pal. *Just one more thing... you know any good kebab spots?&quot;***  
**ð&shy; Social Blend: Calm Tourist + Subtle Disruption + Culinary Curiosity**  
**ð² Bluff Roll (Feigning Sip): +2 Clever +1 Subtlety = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**ð² Bartender's Suspicion Roll: -1 Distracted +2 Professionalism = Result: 1 [Average]**  
**â Outcome: SUCCESS - You play it cool, avoid consumption, and get unexpected intel**

---

You give the bartender your most **vacation-core smile**, token in hand.

&gt; &quot;Yeah, sure, I'll try the Rain Delight. What's the worst that could happen?&quot;  

He chuckles professionally and begins mixing-glass tumbling in one hand, a flick of citrus in the other. The result is a beautiful, frothy concoction in a tall, hourglass-shaped glass. Garnished with **a dehydrated banana slice, a pink umbrella, and... suspiciously blue sugar dust**.

You **raise the glass**, take a whiff (sweet, tropical, with that faint *metallic sting* only your Devil Fruit-tinged senses can pick up), then tip it back-

-but it's a *fake sip*, well-practiced after years of avoiding students' mystery cooking experiments. A flick of your wrist and **the juice trickles smoothly down the back of your hand**, pooling in a napkin below your arm.

&gt; *Kiwi Juice Internal Commentary: &quot;We don't play around with âspecial touches.'&quot;*

You set the glass down, sighing with &quot;satisfaction.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Not bad,&quot; you say, then lean in like a man making small talk after a long day of travel.  
&gt; &quot;Say, pal. You know any good kebab spots? Not the tourist ones. Something *authentic.*&quot;

The bartender blinks. His eyes narrow slightly-but your tone's too casual, too convincingly &quot;off-duty.&quot; He glances left, then right, and lowers his voice.

&gt; &quot;...West docks, look for a guy named **Yazir.**  
Sells **spiced gator kebabs with cactus honey glaze** out of a cart near the *old banana crate warehouse.* You'll know it by the red lantern hanging off the side.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Oh, and sir?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;...If you *do* go there, don't wear that guest badge on your chest. Folks around that alley? Let's just say they don't gamble in Rain Dinners.&quot;

His eyes flit briefly toward the **aquarium** at the back of the casino. For just a second, you swear you see something **massive shift in the blue-black water**-long, scaled, and staring.

---

**ð Info Gained:**

- Successfully avoided ingesting Rain Dinners' suspicious &quot;Rain Delight.&quot;
- Learned about **Yazir's Kebab Cart** - Location: *West docks, near old banana crate warehouse, red lantern landmark.*
- Subtle indication that **non-casino locals avoid the area entirely.**
- The bartender may not be loyal to Baroque Works-possibly just trying to survive.

---

**Inventory Update:**
- Complimentary Drink Token: â Used
- Banana cocktail: âï¸ Siphoned and dumped, no effect  
- Kiwi juice reserves: Stable, minor increase in residual citrus reactivity

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head toward the west docks now. Follow the lead to Yazir's kebab cart-might uncover rebel-friendly contacts or more information.}
2. {Check out the aquarium. Something big is in there. Could be relevant. Could be horrifying.}
3. {Head to your room via the guarded elevators. You've stirred enough curiosity-maybe it's time to scout your surroundings.}
4. {Go to the gaming floor. Act the part, play some cards, and eavesdrop for intel.}
5. {Ask the bartender about the aquarium. If he's loose enough to mention the kebabs, maybe he'll spill more.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - The heck was that?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;The heck was *that?*&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Lightly alarmed, still casual - Curious Tourist Mode Activated**  
**ð² Social Check: Inquiry + Instincts = (Eatone Rapport +2, Kiwi Senses +1) = 3 [Good]**  
**ð² Bartender's Willingness to Talk = (Loyalty to Casino -1, Fear +2) = 1 [Average]**  
**â Outcome: SUCCESS - He responds, but cautiously, choosing his words very carefully.**

---

You stare into the depths of the **Banana Gator Aquarium**, your eyebrows furrowing.

For a moment, the glass had rippled-*not from outside disturbance, but from inside.* Something **moved** in there. Something *big*. The water swirled briefly, then settled, leaving nothing but the vague outline of a long fin or tail. A massive eye glimmered in the dark, then vanished again into the gloom.

&gt; &quot;The heck was *that?*&quot;

Your voice cuts through the soft jazz and shuffling of poker chips, loud enough for the bartender to hear, but still within the safe bounds of *plausible tourist obliviousness.*

He pauses while wiping a glass, his hands stilling just long enough to betray that yes-you definitely *weren't* imagining things.

He leans in, glancing quickly at the **security cameras** perched in the upper corners of the lounge.

&gt; &quot;...Just part of the attraction, sir. The Banana Gators are native to Alabasta. Very rare, very exotic. Part of the... charm.&quot;

You raise an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;That looked a lot bigger than a Banana Gator.&quot;

He meets your gaze, slowly sets the glass down, and speaks in a much quieter voice:

&gt; &quot;*They* call it â**Galeon.**' Not a gator. Not local. Came in months ago by special request... *personally approved by the owner.*&quot;

His voice lowers again, the weight of the words clear.

&gt; &quot;The... kind of creature that doesn't swim in a tank unless someone *very powerful* wants it there. I've seen it eat things whole. Things that scream.&quot;

There's a long pause before he straightens, plastering a *resort-issue smile* back on his face.

&gt; &quot;But it's not *your* concern, sir. You're on vacation! Maybe... head to the spa, yes?&quot;

A nearby **security goon** with an earpiece shifts his gaze briefly toward you. Just once.

The bartender's tone tightens. He no longer wants to talk.

---

**ð Info Gained:**

- The creature in the aquarium is named **Galeon** - *not a Banana Gator*, *not native*, *and potentially used as a living trap.*
- It was personally brought in under orders from &quot;the owner&quot; - likely **Sir Crocodile**.
- Galeon may serve as a *biological deterrent* or even an execution method.
- **Casino security is listening.**

---

**Time: Early Night | Casino Lights Now Fully Active**  
**Music: &quot;Sand Between My Cards&quot; - Lounge Jazz with Dramatic Undertones**  
**Location: Rain Dinners - Main Bar Area**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head immediately to the west docks. Time to find Yazir's kebab stand and get out of this death-lounge.}
2. {Excuse yourself calmly, head to your suite to regroup. Might be best to plan your next move from a secure room.}
3. {Continue engaging with staff and play the friendly tourist. Try to draw out more info on &quot;Galeon&quot; or &quot;the owner.&quot;}
4. {Try to make contact with the mysterious group you saw earlier-maybe they've got more intel on what this place is hiding.}
5. {Ready a Kiwi Juice decoy maneuver. Leave a &quot;juice replica&quot; at the bar while you slip away, just in case you're being tracked.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - Odd. I wonder if those weirdos were staying here as well. Might as well take a walk around the casino floor.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 4 Selected - &quot;Maybe those weirdos are guests too...&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Curious, Cautiously Social | Status: Infiltrating As A Tourist**  
**ð² Passive Check: Observational Awareness (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Kiwi Juice Sensory Overlay) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**ð² Stealth Check (Not to draw too much attention while wandering) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**â&nbsp;ï¸ Result: Partial Success - You keep it cool... but *someone* clocks you.**

---

**LOCATION SHIFT: Rain Dinners - Casino Floor**

The bar fades into soft murmurs and neon haze as you rise, dust off your travel jacket, and casually stroll into the **heart of the casino floor**.

The vibe hits instantly-like stepping into the eye of a lavish, **predatory storm**.  

Golden carpets with crocodile-print filigree stretch across the room. **Slot machines blink and chime** like sirens luring sailors. **Dice roll, cards slap**, and drinks clink. Laughter rings out-but too loud, too forced. It's the laughter of gamblers praying not to lose the shirt off their backs.

All around you, **guards in white suits** stand *just far enough* from the tables to seem ornamental, but their eyes don't blink much. You clock two with **hidden batons**, one with **sea prism handcuffs**, and one guy pretending to be a tourist while palming something under his coat.

You **pass by several clusters of patrons**, noting potential NPCs:

### ð¥ Notable Casino Patrons (Visible)
- A **large, bald man in a crimson sash**, surrounded by a small entourage, aggressively playing a game of sand-craps and yelling, &quot;KING COBRA AIN'T GOT SHIT ON MY LUCK!&quot;
- A **hooded figure** near the pachinko machines... who keeps glancing over his shoulder like someone's watching *him*.
- A pair of tourists making out in a dark corner-**one of them has a Baroque Works tattoo on their neck**, mostly hidden under a scarf.
- A hunched old woman with sharp, intelligent eyes, **writing on a napkin** and muttering numbers.

And then-

As you pass by the **poker tables**, something twitches at the edge of your Devil Fruit senses.

**Kiwi juice resonates** faintly near the **VIP corridor** beyond a velvet rope. A small trace-a moisture displacement ripple, like something organic recently moved through at speed. Your trained nose catches a whiff of sweat, animal dander, and a *faint berry-sugar trail.*

It's that little **blue-nosed reindeer again**.

You didn't see him go in-but his scent is fresh. He, or one of the Straw Hats, must have **snuck past security.**

Then, a chill up your spine. You turn just in time to see a man at the far end of the hall lower his newspaper.

**Square jaw. Glaring eyes. A silver-gray cigar hangs from his mouth.**  
He locks eyes with you, briefly.

**It's *Smoker the White Hunter.***  
You blink-and he's gone, like mist.

&gt; Was that real? Or has this place finally gotten to you?

---

**ð Updates:**

- At least **one Straw Hat crew member is inside Rain Dinners**, near or beyond the VIP section.
- You may have just seen **Captain Smoker**, or someone impersonating him.
- Your movement hasn't gone unnoticed. A **security agent** (dressed as a patron) is now subtly trailing you from the drinks kiosk.
- This place is a lot *deeper* than a normal casino.

---

**Time: Night Proper | Casino Fully Operational | Security Level: Medium**  
**Current Status: Undetected by hostiles, but on soft watch**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Try to sneak past the velvet rope and investigate the VIP hallway. Maybe Chopper-or another Straw Hat-is deeper inside.}
2. {Approach the hunched old woman muttering to herself. She may be counting cards... or hiding information.}
3. {Confront the security agent tailing you-but make it casual, like you just bumped into him. See what he's really watching.}
4. {Exit the casino floor and head toward the docks now. Too much is building up in here-you need outside air, and maybe a kebab.}
5. {Head back toward the aquarium. See if you can spot Smoker again-or confirm if what you saw was real.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I blink, trying to see if my eyes were tricking me about seeing the Marine Captain. I've heard of him in the news.

Observe the security guard tailing me.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Wait... was that *Smoker*? No, focus. Who's this tailing me?&quot;**  
**ðµï¸ââï¸ Passive Check: Famous Faces Recognition - (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Lore/Newsroll) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**ð² Observation Check on Security Tail - (Eatone +2 Careful +1 Subtle Kiwi Juice Sensory) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð² Opposed Roll - Tail's Stealth (Skilled Agent: +2 Deceit, +1 Bluff) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: SUCCESS - You ID the tail and gain leverage on him without exposing yourself**

---

**You blink**, the casino's lights warping around you in a prismatic blur of glitter, neon, and tension. That had to be **Smoker**-*The White Hunter*, Marine Captain, notorious for going off-script and chasing pirates like a bloodhound through bureaucratic red tape.

You've read about him in the **World Economy News Paper**, usually buried under headlines about sea battles and rising bounties. *&quot;Justice Obsessed Marine Tracks Pirates Through The Grand Line - Collateral Damage Unknown.&quot;*

&gt; *&quot;If he's here... then this place is even more messed up than I thought.&quot;*

But you file it away. Right now, **someone else is watching you.**

You reach for your juice senses-pressing your fingers to the inside of your palm like you're cracking a knuckle-and feel the **moisture ripple around a nearby drink station.** Kiwi Juice molecules split across your skin in hair-thin tendrils, mimicking the humidity of the air... and **you catch him.**

### ð¯ Target: Undercover Security Tail
- **Male, mid-thirties**, faux-stubble that looks too perfect to be natural.
- Wearing a **patterned short-sleeve shirt**, holding a tourist drink he hasn't sipped once.
- His eyes? Watching reflections in mirrors. Watching *you*.
- Under his shirt: a **hidden baton holster**, left hip. Just like yours-except *not Seastone-tipped.*

You slow your pace, then fake a pause at a card table, acting like you're deciding whether or not to bet. As you do, you feel a surge of professional satisfaction.

&gt; He's good. But not *teacher-on-break, battle-trained bounty hunter with Devil Fruit intuition* good.

Then-he flinches.

Just a little. He knows you spotted him. You catch the tiny adjustment in posture: his feet shift. His drink hand tightens. **He's bracing.**

&gt; If you approach now, you have the upper hand.

---

**ð You've Gained:**

- **Visual confirmation of your tail**, including weapon placement and likely training level.
- He works for the **Rain Dinners private security team**, probably linked directly to Baroque Works.
- He's not here to eject you-*yet.* Most likely observing your path and checking your loyalty.
- You're still technically &quot;safe,&quot; but now *dancing at the edge of the crocodile's jaw.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Approach casually. &quot;Hey there. You watching me or the girl at the bar?&quot; Make it playful, but let him know *you see him*.}
2. {Pull a sudden maneuver-spill your drink, fake a stumble, test how quickly he reacts. See if he's wired to subdue or just watch.}
3. {Move toward the back of the casino where foot traffic is heavier. Lose him in the crowd and slip away toward the VIP hall.}
4. {Leave the casino floor entirely and head to the west docks. Whatever's happening here, you now know you're not the only agent.}
5. {Use your Devil Fruit: secretly deposit a slick, invisible kiwi juice trail across the floor behind you-if he follows, he'll trip. Juice trap roll required.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I... is this a problem with my reservation? I'm pretty sure I booked the correct dates when I made it.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Oh no... is this a *reservation* issue?&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: NaÃ¯ve Tourist + Light Anxiety = Expert Bluff Disarmament**  
**ð² Social Roll - Honest Confusion Gambit: (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Situational Plausibility) = 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Security Agent Bluff Resistance: +1 Training, -2 Caught Off Guard = -1 [Terrible]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: CRITICAL SUCCESS - Tail mentally disarms, lowers guard, and assumes you're a soft target**

---

You turn, drink still in hand (untouched, of course), and approach the tailing man with a polite, slightly distressed expression that would melt any customer service rep's will to live.

&gt; &quot;Hi, uh, sorry-excuse me?&quot; you say, half-sheepish.  
&gt; &quot;You've been watching me for the past few minutes, and I just wanna ask... is this a problem with my reservation?&quot;

You flash him your **Rain Dinners room keycard** and the **used drink voucher**, the very picture of a confused man just trying to have a normal vacation while resisting a world-class mental breakdown.

The tail blinks.

He stiffens, shoulders tensing... then rapidly *untenses* as the situation hits him all at once. You can *see* it:

&gt; *&quot;Ah, damn. Just another over-cautious sweep. He's just some schoolteacher from another island. Probably thinks this place is a real resort.&quot;*

He forces a short laugh-*too short*-and shakes his head like he's embarrassed **for you**.

&gt; &quot;No, no, sir. Sorry. We've just got a lot of first-time guests getting lost in the maze of lounges. I'm part of guest relations security.  
Just making sure no one's straying into the VIP zones without an escort. For safety. That's all.&quot;

His tone's just barely professional, but *he's buying it*. You've thrown him off his rhythm.

He pulls out a **small, crystal-paned tablet** from his belt and taps into it.

&gt; &quot;Uh, let me confirm your room, actually. What's the last name on your reservation? Shouldn't take more than a minute.&quot;

He's already halfway convinced it's a software error or an overzealous scan. You're a **non-threat** in his eyes now.

---

**ð Info Gained / Advantages:**

- Tail has completely dropped his guard - you're not flagged as a threat anymore.  
- He's part of **Rain Dinners internal surveillance**, not a high-level Baroque agent.
- He's carrying a **guest registry device**, likely linked to all room keys and casino access points.
- You now have an opening to **feed him false info**, stall, or potentially dig for more-without being suspected.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Feed him your real name and reservation info-play it 100% straight. Gather intel on what they log, and if you're already flagged.}
2. {Give a **slightly wrong** name and see if he corrects you-test how close they're monitoring you.}
3. {Fake an &quot;Oh! Sorry, I actually left my wallet in the room!&quot; and use this moment to vanish toward the VIP hall or a side exit.}
4. {Ask him some &quot;innocent&quot; tourist questions: &quot;So what's *really* in the VIP area? I saw a weird animal in the aquarium...&quot; See how much he'll share.}
5. {Lean in and say, &quot;Off the record... do you think Rain Dinners is safe right now?&quot; Stir the pot. See if he'll spill under pressure.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Err, Cheng. Room number... I think it was one of the balcony suites, room 703. Complimentary bathrobe service should be included.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Err, Cheng. Room 703. Bathrobe service.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Bluff Level: Light Deception, Heavy Specificity (Too boring to question)**
**ð² Social Check - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Believable Details) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð² Opposed Roll - Security Agent Database Cross-check (Generic Protocol +1, Distracted by Complacency -2) = Result: -1 [Terrible]**  
**ð¯ CRITICAL SUCCESS - You are now officially âCheng of 703' in the resort's eyes.**

---

&gt; &quot;Err... Cheng. Room number... 703. Balcony suite. I think it came with bathrobe service?&quot;

You scratch the back of your head in that very specific, **&quot;I'm a clueless but polite guest&quot;** way as the agent taps away on his tablet, clearly expecting to find a red flag-or at least a missing name.

But then:

&gt; **&quot;Ah-yep. Found it. Cheng. Room 703, East Balcony Level, bathrobe service included, welcome snack delivered an hour ago. You're good.&quot;**

He nods as if trying to convince himself he *wasn't* just following a normal guy who smells vaguely like kiwis and carries a schoolteacher's posture. He doesn't even question how you didn't remember your own name right away-your tone was just that convincing.

&gt; &quot;Apologies again. We've had a few counterfeit passes lately-couple guests slipped into the VIP levels earlier, caused a fuss. Whole floor's restricted now.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;You're clear. Have a great night, Mr. Cheng.&quot;

And just like that, the tail backs off.

You're now officially registered in the system under **âCheng, Room 703'**, which not only gives you **plausible deniability** for any further movement, but also gives you a clean name to use should you need to bypass basic check-in points or surveillance.

He strolls off toward the roulette tables, muttering into an earpiece-*not about you.*

---

**ð Status Update:**

- â You now have a **clean alias** in Rain Dinners systems: *Cheng, Room 703*.
- ðï¸ Room 703 is now a safe fallback location.
- ð§ Your cover as a clueless tourist is rock solid-for now.
- ð¨ You're not on the internal watchlist-yet.
- ð± Security agent's tablet confirms your name, suite, and amenities. You *might* be able to spoof others now, if you get access.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Actually head up to Room 703. Check out what the &quot;Cheng&quot; package includes. Could be useful, or hiding a bugged minibar.}
2. {Use your new alias to request a &quot;forgotten guest pass&quot; to the VIP level. Play the curious guest angle.}
3. {Mosey toward the aquarium again. Now you know you're not being watched, it might be time to see if Smoker is real or a ghost.}
4. {Leave the casino floor and head toward the docks. You've made your mark here-maybe Yazir the kebab seller knows something Cheng doesn't.}
5. {Circle back to the old woman muttering over napkins. You've got time, and she might be more than she looks.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Was there really a Marine Captain in a casino of all places? Also ask a passing server for a Daiquiri.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Was that *really* Smoker? What would a Marine Captain be doing here?&quot;**  
**ð¸ Side Action: Requesting a Daiquiri - Smooth Tourist Disguise Maintained**  
**ð² Observation Roll - Eatone (Careful + Kiwi Sensory + Lore) = 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Daiquiri Service Roll - NPC Bartender (Efficiency + Flair) = 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You gather intel *and* get a perfect drink. That's a win.**

---

You casually peel off from the gaming floor, sipping at your surroundings rather than any drink-until a **passing server in a crimson vest** walks by carrying a tray of martinis, banana coladas, and something that looks vaguely radioactive.

You raise a hand and smile.

&gt; &quot;Excuse me. Could I get a Daiquiri? Classic, please. None of the glow-in-the-dark stuff.&quot;

She nods with a professional smile.

&gt; &quot;Of course, sir. One daiquiri-no tourist gimmicks.&quot;

She disappears toward the bar.

Now, with your cover secured and a drink en route, you drift back toward the **aquarium**-but you don't head straight for the glass. Instead, you take the long route, weaving around through a high-traffic area and stopping near a tall fountain spouting **blue-lit water** from a golden crocodile's mouth. It gives you a **clean line of sight** to the aquarium... and its dim interior.

You stare into the tank.

The room is darker here. Quieter. Even the background jazz softens into near silence as you approach the blue glow of the glass.

**Something is moving again**-but slower this time. Not the creature. A figure.

You narrow your eyes.

There's a **man inside the aquarium chamber**, just behind the outer glass wall, in a **tight security passage** not visible from most angles. For a moment, his **white jacket flutters**, revealing the unmistakable **Marine crest** and the nameplate that makes your stomach twist:

&gt; **SMOKER**

He stands alone in the hall, arms crossed, **leaning back against the glass** with his usual scowl carved into his face like a rock formation. A pair of **Den Den Mushi-like devices** blink faintly near his feet-recorders?

He's watching something on a **hidden monitor** just inside the tank room-likely observing the **inner VIP prison complex**, if the rumors are true.

&gt; He's not here as a guest. He's infiltrated. Alone.

You don't have a clear way to reach him-security panels block the lower hallway entrance to wherever he's slipped into-but now you **know**.

&gt; **Captain Smoker is on-site. Incognito. Watching Rain Dinners from the inside.**

Then-

&gt; &quot;Your drink, sir.&quot;

You turn to find the server from earlier smiling politely. She presents you with an elegant glass-a flawless **classic daiquiri**, just as requested. No banana. No toxins. Smells like fresh lime, rum, and mint.

&gt; &quot;On the house. Someone noticed your âgreat taste.'&quot; she says with a wink, and walks away without waiting for a tip.

You now have **the best drink in the building** and a mental map forming of who's in play.

---

**ð New Intel:**

- **Smoker is here, inside the aquarium complex**, watching internal Rain Dinners operations. He is not here officially.
- **Marine surveillance equipment** is active. This may be Smoker's own black-ops job.
- You are likely the only civilian who's seen him so far.
- The Daiquiri is... **phenomenal.**

---

**Inventory Update:**
- ð¥ One Daiquiri - Cold, minty, no toxins detected  
- ð Status: &quot;Cheng, Guest of Room 703&quot; (Still intact)  
- ð§&nbsp; Mental Map: Rain Dinners has an inner monitoring system behind aquarium walls  

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Look for a way to signal Smoker discreetly. A scribbled note, juice-trail message, or visual cue through the glass. Risky, but might connect.}
2. {Try to find the hidden hallway entrance. If Smoker's down there, maybe there's a service route you can slip through.}
3. {Retreat for now-head to your suite. Process what you've learned, and prep a strategy.}
4. {Visit Yazir at the docks. You're ready to see if the kebab stand's more than just a tasty rumor.}
5. {Seek out the Straw Hats. If Smoker's watching them, maybe you can *help*-or get ahead of them.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Huh. That's odd. Maybe he's on an op. Best not to mess with the man's work. I follow the server. Hey, do you know where the elevator is to floor 7? My room's up there.

OOC: Give me a window to respond if an NPC talks to my character.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Huh. Best not to get involved with the white-haired murder-machine.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Polite Tourist with a Keen Eye | Strategy: Disengage from danger, relocate to secured suite**  
**ð² Navigation Check - Calm Infiltration Toward Suite: (Eatone +2 Clever, +1 Social Subtlety) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**ð² Server's Demeanor - (Professionalism + Hospitality) = 3 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: Success - You smoothly relocate toward your suite while maintaining your cover**

---

You let out a low hum behind your daiquiri, then take a sip-**damn**, it *really is good*. Limey. Cold. Clean. Like it was mixed by someone who actually knows what &quot;subtle&quot; means.

&gt; *&quot;Smoker's here... and alone. If he's not busting down doors, it's not my job to poke the cage.&quot;*

You turn from the aquarium and **follow the server**, weaving through the last cluster of clinking chips and garish fruit hats. Your body language is calm, loose, perfectly calibrated to someone who's had *just enough* to drink to be relaxed but not enough to be noticed.

&gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; you ask as you catch up, &quot;do you know where the elevator is to floor 7? My room's up there.&quot;

The server glances over her shoulder and gives a polite, trained nod. Her voice is friendly-but precise, like a script she's said a hundred times today.

&gt; &quot;Of course, sir. That would be the **gold elevators**, just past the House of Fortune roulette tables-turn right at the crocodile fountain. You'll need your room card for access.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Room 703, correct? You'll have a **balcony view over the east canal**, and I believe you also have **bathrobe privileges**. The chocolate-covered cactus fruit was delivered twenty minutes ago.&quot;

She smiles wider, slightly less plastic this time, and gives a nod before peeling off with her tray of drinks.

&gt; &quot;Enjoy your stay, Mr. Cheng.&quot;

---

**ð¯ You are now heading to the Guest Elevator - Floor 7 Access Only**  
**Status: Unbothered, Unflagged, In Motion Toward Private Quarters**  
**Time: Mid-Evening | Casino lights in full swing | Security Presence: Medium**  
**Drink in Hand: One Daiquiri (Perfect)**  
**Distraction Status: Security Tail = Eliminated, Smoker = Engaged Elsewhere**

---

You follow her directions: past the gold-trimmed **House of Fortune roulette tables**, around the giant **gilded crocodile fountain** (its mouth still gushing suspiciously milky mineral water), and finally find the **elevator bank**.

Four doors. Three marked for public floors. One-**gold-trimmed and marked &quot;Balcony Level Suites Only&quot;**-has a slot for your room key.

You slide it.

**Green light. Ding. Doors open.**

The elevator is empty.

A single **ballad version of Binks' Sake** plays softly as you ascend. You watch your reflection in the mirrored walls, drink in one hand, other resting lightly over the inner pocket that contains your **Seastone-tipped baton**-just in case.

**The elevator dings again. Floor 7.**

Doors part.

A wide, marble hallway stretches out. Plush carpeting muffles your steps. **Lanterns flicker** with soft, golden light. Each door is sleek, numbered in gold-701, 702...

**703. Your room. Waiting.**

---

**Do you enter your suite, Mr. Cheng?**

1. {Yes, enter quietly. Check the room for bugs, traps, or guests. You are in enemy territory, after all.}
2. {Wait-listen at the door first. Maybe someone got here *before* you.}
3. {Knock lightly first. If someone answers, well... then something's very wrong.}
4. {Leave a juice-slick tripline in front of the door, then open it from the side. Just in case.}
5. {Do something unexpected: knock on a *neighboring* room, pretend you're lost, and test who else is on this floor.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Where's that free snack they said they delivered?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Let's see what 703's got. Starting with that chocolate-covered cactus fruit.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Alert but Casually Curious | Approach: Routine Room Entry with Discreet Security Sweep**  
**ð² Trap/Bug Check (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Devil Fruit Sensory, +1 Teacher-Level Paranoia) = 6 [Great]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: Suite is clear of traps-but not *untouched.* The snack? Present. But suspicious.**

---

You slide the keycard into the door of **Room 703**.

The lock clicks with a soft *chime*, and the door swings open with a whisper.

Cool, *fragranced* air greets you-citrus-sandalwood, faint, like someone wanted to evoke &quot;desert breeze&quot; but ended up with &quot;art teacher's office.&quot;

**The room is... absurdly nice.**

A **circular king-size bed** dominates the center, wrapped in light cream linens with a crocodile-shaped chocolate resting on the pillow. One wall is made entirely of **glass**, opening onto a private balcony with a view of **the eastern canal**, where the wind off the water carries occasional smells of spices and salt.

A chaise lounge rests near the window. A **mini-bar** hums softly.

And sitting neatly atop the **glass coffee table** beside a folded plush bathrobe is a **white porcelain dish**, upon which rests-

### ð¥&shy; *A piece of chocolate-covered cactus fruit*

Perfectly cut. Dusted with gold-leaf flakes. A tiny **parchment label** sticks out of it like a cocktail flag.

&gt; &quot;**Rain Dinners Welcomes You - May Fortune Bloom in the Dunes!**&quot;

You don't take a bite. Not yet.

Instead, you begin a **methodical sweep**, trained both by bounty work and the unshakeable instincts of a man who once confiscated 17 makeshift blowguns in a middle school science fair.

### ð Sweep Results:

- **Windows**: Functional, not sealed. Can be opened fully. Escape route viable.
- **Air vents**: Clean. No signs of bugs or gas-release systems.
- **Bedding**: Untouched. Firm pillows. Nothing hidden beneath.
- **Mini-bar**: Stocked with standard drinks and juice boxes labeled &quot;Fruit Punch!&quot; (you wince).
- **Ceiling tiles**: Fixed tight. No crawlspace access.
- **Walls**: Normal plaster overlay-no strange echoes suggesting hollow compartments.
- **Snack**: Visually safe. No visible powder, residue, or discoloration. Smells sweet and faintly herbal.  

But...

Your **Devil Fruit-enhanced juice-sense** prickles faintly near the snack. *Moisture's been disturbed.* Not added-*moved.* Like someone touched the plate and then adjusted it *perfectly back into place.*

&gt; Someone was *in this room* after the snack was delivered.

And they were **careful**.

No cameras. No wire taps. But someone was watching-testing your presence?

---

**ð Updated Info:**

- â No lethal traps, no surveillance bugs-this isn't a kill-box.
- â&nbsp;ï¸ Snack was **handled** post-delivery.
- ðª Windows are functional escape points.
- ð Plate contains a strange message: &quot;May Fortune Bloom in the Dunes.&quot; (Might be code? Or just cheesy branding.)
- ð¹ You still have your perfect daiquiri.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Leave the snack untouched and start quietly setting up juice-based traps in the room. Defensive prep.}
2. {Take a tiny, test bite of the snack. Just enough to sample. Roll for potential side effects.}
3. {Dump the cactus fruit in the balcony planter. See if anyone comes to check on it.}
4. {Pretend you ate the snack. Arrange the plate like you enjoyed it, then hide in the room and wait.}
5. {Use the time to try contacting Enzo (Marine contact) again-see if he can dig up anything about Room 703 or the phrase &quot;Fortune Bloom in the Dunes.&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Also jam a stick or something in the window. I need to be able to exfiltrate through there in case there's some sort of remote lockdown.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;Alright. Snack test first. Also let's not get trapped like a fool.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Cautious Curiosity + Subtle Prepper Paranoia**  
**ð² Bite Test - Sample the snack (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Kiwi Juice Internal Resistance) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**ð² Snack Effect Roll - ??? = Result: 3 [Neutral]**  
**ð² Prep Action - Window Jam Setup (Eatone +2 Clever +1 Resourcefulness) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You taste-test the snack safely *and* rig the window for a clean escape. The suite is now tactically secured.**

---

You stare at the cactus fruit for a long moment, swirling your daiquiri in one hand and gently flexing the fingers on the other. **Too perfect** a snack is always suspicious... but you're a man of reason. And curiosity.

&gt; &quot;Alright, let's see what the âCactus Deluxe' tastes like...&quot;

You pull out your **travel spork**-never leave the island without it-and slice off a sliver of the fruit. It's... firm. Slightly sticky. The **chocolate smells real**, none of that fake Alabastan sugar-substitute crap. You rest the daiquiri nearby (juice defenses on standby) and take a very **measured** bite.

**Flavor Notes:**
- Tart, like prickly pear.
- Smooth chocolate melt.
- Subtle bitterness on the finish-something herbal, like aloe or crushed sea lavender.

&gt; *Kiwi Juice sensors at rest. No toxin alert. Just... weirdly healthy for a casino treat.*

You wait thirty seconds.

**No burning. No dizziness. No hallucinations of dancing crocodiles.** Just... kind of a *refreshing zing*.

&gt; *They really did just try to impress me with a fancy fruit dessert, huh?*

...Still weird that someone *handled it after delivery,* but the fruit itself seems clean.

---

Then, you get to work on something **far more important: escape engineering.**

You inspect the **window lock**-a vertical sliding pane with a gemstone-crusted handle. Beautiful, but flimsy.

From your pack, you retrieve a **wooden stirring stick** from the daiquiri tray and a **small pair of compact binder clips** from your teacher's kit. With a few deft motions, you:

- Jam the stick *inside the upper track*, preventing the window from fully sealing even under remote command.
- Use one clip to hold the window just slightly ajar-enough to let juice flow or allow a last-second dive.

Then, as a backup, you discreetly embed a **kiwi juice filament** around the sill-a living humidity sensor. If someone touches the window from outside, you'll know.

---

**ð Tactical Status:**

- â Cactus snack: *Safe. Possibly symbolic. May contain mild stimulant herbs.*
- â Window: Now *exfil-ready* - will remain open even if lockdown is triggered.
- ð Kiwi Juice Sensor embedded: alerts you to outside tampering.
- ð Room: Currently secure. Lights dimmed to low. Curtains open, canal lights twinkling.

---

A soft breeze trickles in from the window. The desert air smells clean tonight.

But beneath that peace, you can feel it.

**This place is building toward something.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait in the suite. Hide near the door or balcony and see if anyone comes to &quot;check on you.&quot; Could be revealing.}
2. {Head to the west docks now. You've confirmed your suite is safe. Time to chase Yazir's lead.}
3. {Try to find a service route or employee hallway. Something tells you the real secrets aren't on the guest floors.}
4. {See if you can make contact with Smoker. Now that you're stable, you might risk a private note or juice signal.}
5. {Look for your next bounty. Maybe there's someone in Rainbase tied to this mess-and worth tracking.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Well, at least the suite's decent. Let's head back downstairs. Maybe play a few games. I hope they have strip poker (not).

OOC: Where are the relevant characters right now?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option Selected - &quot;Let's head back downstairs. Kill time, play a few games... definitely not strip poker.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Tourist Mode - Chill Exterior, Sharp Interior | Status: Returning to Casino Floor With Confidence**  
**ð² Mood Check - Eatone (Relaxed but Ready) = 3 [Fair]**

---

You down the last of your **award-winning daiquiri**, brush off your shirt, and head for the elevator. With the window secured and the snack confirmed *not poisoned*, your suite now feels more like a **safehouse** than a trap.

&gt; &quot;Decent room. Gonna be real mad if this place tries to kill me now.&quot;

The elevator descends slowly, a soft instrumental version of *Jungle P* playing through the speaker in what can only be described as &quot;gondola elevator-core.&quot;  
Ding.

**You're back on the main floor. The air is thicker now-warmer, louder, and pulsing with a little more tension than earlier.**

**Before we proceed-here's a snapshot of relevant NPC positions as of now:**

---

### ð **Relevant Character Positions in Rainbase / Rain Dinners**

#### ð **Sir Crocodile (Mr. 0)**  
- **Location:** *Private Upper Quarters, Rain Dinners*  
- **Status:** Finalizing Operation Utopia logistics. Aware of increased intruder presence.  
- **Notes:** Has been alerted to the Straw Hats' suspected presence. Still believes he has the advantage.

#### ð **Nico Robin (Miss All Sunday)**  
- **Location:** Unknown, likely in transit between Crocodile's quarters and inner casino operations  
- **Status:** Monitoring intel channels. Might know about Smoker. Definitely watching you-indirectly.  
- **Notes:** Curious about anomalies. Might be interested in someone like you: observant, under the radar.

#### ð¦ **Tony Tony Chopper**  
- **Location:** Currently hiding in a **maintenance vent system** that runs behind the aquarium complex  
- **Status:** Monitoring from within-likely saw Smoker as well. Has NOT reported to the rest of the crew yet.  
- **Notes:** He left trace scents you followed earlier. May re-emerge soon if he feels safe.

#### ð **Monkey D. Luffy**  
- **Location:** *Deeper inside Rain Dinners*, separated from group-likely detained, or attempting reckless solo infiltration.  
- **Status:** Unconfirmed. Likely charging headfirst toward danger.  
- **Notes:** Always the wild card.

#### âï¸ **Roronoa Zoro, Nami, Usopp**  
- **Location:** Separated across guest-accessible and lower levels. **Nami** may have breached VIP access posing as a high-roller.  
- **Status:** Gathering recon, stealth-based.  
- **Notes:** Might cross paths with you soon.

#### ð **Captain Smoker**  
- **Location:** Aquarium Security Monitoring Passage - Hidden Hallways  
- **Status:** Infiltrating. Observing Crocodile's activities. Possibly laying trap or waiting on confirmation.  
- **Notes:** Likely knows about the Straw Hats and is tracking them. Has seen you.

#### ð&shy; **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**  
- **Location:** Left casino, but *may return in disguise*. Known to mimic identities using his Clone-Clone Fruit.  
- **Status:** Playful, unpredictable. Could show up *as anyone*.

---

### Casino Floor - Now

The floor's packed now: gamblers, dancers, dealers, and the soft croon of an Alabastan jazz trio fill the space. The smell of citrus-scented smoke and fried plantain lingers in the air. The mood is **festive**, but just under the surface: people are watching. Listening. Waiting.

You spot the **main gaming floor** ahead-tables of cards, dice, and wheel games beckoning. There's even a group of tourists shouting about a **Banana Gator Racing Game** in a corner arena.

No sign of immediate danger. But the night isn't over yet.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Play a few hands of poker or dice. Blend in. Listen for chatter, maybe overhear something useful.}
2. {Look for Nami-if she's posing as a high-roller, the VIP poker tables would be a solid lead.}
3. {Try to slip behind the scenes again. There are still secrets below the casino floor.}
4. {Head for the Banana Gator Races. Could be ridiculous fun or a secret front. Possibly both.}
5. {Circle back toward the aquarium. Try to leave a hidden message for Smoker.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I do like me some games. What the heck is Banana Gator racing, anyways?

OOC: I know nothing about the Straw Hats. Following Canon, Will they fall into Crocodile's trap soon? Where's Vivi?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Let's gamble a little. Also, *what in the name of Oda is Banana Gator racing?*&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Curious, Lighthearted, Alert | Action: Blend In, Observe, Enjoy(?)**  
**ð² Roleplaying Integration Check: (Eatone +1 Fun-Loving +2 Careful) = 4 [Good]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You seamlessly join the crowd, enjoy the show, and gather ambient intel.**

---

You meander past the poker and dice tables with the smooth, casual air of a man trying to look like he's here for fun and definitely *not* for recon. The **banana-scented smoke**, the **jazzy tunes**, the **soft clack of dice**-it all blends into a strangely relaxing backdrop.

Then you hear it:

&gt; **&quot;AND THEY'RE OFF!!&quot;**

A raucous cheer erupts from a side area beneath an arch marked:  
### ð¯ **&quot;Banana Gator RumbleDome: Rain Dinners' #1 Exotic Spectacle!&quot;**

**You follow the noise** and arrive at an indoor arena-half cocktail lounge, half betting den-with a central tank-like track. Inside? **Six Banana Gators**, each nearly the size of a small car, are fitted with **colorful saddle harnesses and racing numbers**, paddling furiously through a circular watercourse like massive reptilian jet-skis.

Above the track, a flamboyant announcer in a green feather boa is screaming into a golden snail mic:

&gt; &quot;And Number FOUR-*âGator-ade'*-takes the lead! Look at those thighs move, folks!! What a powerhouse!&quot;

You blink. It's **weirdly impressive**. The gators **swim fast**, some even executing surprisingly tight turns. One of them **accidentally launches a splash into the crowd**, soaking a nearby gambler who shouts something about **losing his mortgage on a rigged race**.

There's even a **betting board**:

- Gator 1 - *Munchie*
- Gator 2 - *Goldfang*
- Gator 3 - *Snack Pack*
- Gator 4 - *Gator-ade*
- Gator 5 - *Seabiscuit*
- Gator 6 - *Uncle Steve*

People are placing bets via **snail terminals** and hooting as gators race around the lazy-river-meets-gladiator-pit course.

&gt; Banana Gator Racing: Where unholy biology meets mid-tier sports entertainment.

You sidle up to the rail, casually sip from your refilled daiquiri (courtesy of a passing tray), and listen in.

---

**ð Ambient Chatter Intel (Overheard at the RumbleDome):**

- **&quot;Some blonde woman just won a three million berri hand at the VIP poker table-place went *silent.*&quot;** (*Possibly Nami.*)
- **&quot;I heard they closed the east access corridor-someone saw a *Marine jacket* near the aquarium tunnel.&quot;** (*Smoker alert is spreading.*)
- **&quot;Banana Gator 3's on juice again. Look at the twitching.&quot;**  
- **&quot;Security's been high-strung tonight. Even the boss hasn't been seen on the main floor. Usually he makes an appearance...&quot;**

---

**OOC: Canon Update - Vivi &amp; Straw Hats Timeline Context**

You're **not aware** of the Straw Hats' fame, names, or their connection to Alabasta. From your POV, they're just &quot;those weirdos from the alley.&quot;

However, based on *One Piece* canon at this exact point:

- The **Straw Hats** (minus Sanji) will **soon fall into Crocodile's trap** at Rain Dinners.  
- They'll be **captured inside the Seastone Cage**, beneath the casino.  
- **Luffy, Zoro, Nami, Usopp, and Vivi** will be imprisoned shortly-Chopper and Sanji will escape this fate and attempt a rescue.
- **Vivi**, at this moment, is **still with the Straw Hats**, possibly sneaking through side corridors trying to either locate King Cobra or intercept Baroque Works agents. She has not been captured *yet*, but she's **in danger**.

You may cross paths with her very soon if you continue exploring the casino floor or VIP zones.

---

**Current Summary:**

- ð¸ Daiquiri: Topped off  
- ð Banana Gator Races: Entertaining + great distraction  
- ð² Gaming Mood: High. People are rowdy. Security is distracted.  
- ð¯ Possible Intel Leads: Nami winning big, east corridor lockdown, increasing Marine rumors

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Place a small bet on a Banana Gator. Blend in, maybe win some cash while fishing for more gossip.}
2. {Head toward the VIP area. If someone won big there, you want to see it. Possibly find this &quot;blonde woman.&quot;}
3. {Try to follow up on the east corridor lockdown. Pretend you're &quot;looking for the bathroom.&quot;}
4. {Leave the casino now and check in at the west docks/kebab stand. You've gathered some intel and tension's rising.}
5. {Return briefly to your suite to prepare in case the situation explodes. Lay low, wait for fireworks.}

ð {Choose your action.}

**â Rolling... Result: 2nd Place!**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You don't win big, but you walk away with *double your money* and a pretty entertaining moment.**

---

You raise a hand, casual as a cucumber floating in juice.

&gt; &quot;Yeah, I'll throw 50 on *Snack Pack.* I like juice. I feel a connection.&quot;

You tap it into the **snail betting terminal**, which responds with a chipper *&quot;Beri received! All bets are final! May your gator glide!&quot;* The crowd continues buzzing, eyes locked on the transparent aquatic track as the **second heat** begins.

An announcer bellows through magically-enhanced speakers:

&gt; &quot;LADIES, GENTLEMEN, AND CROCODILE ENTHUSIASTS-HEAT TWO BEGINS IN THREE... TWO... OOOOONE-**CHOMP!!**&quot;

Six Banana Gators surge forward into the circular current like prehistoric torpedoes. They're **shockingly fast**, their tails propelling them in tight loops around the track as gamblers slam fists and scream numbers.

&gt; &quot;Goldfang's got an early lead-but WAIT! Snack Pack just took a shortcut inside the current!&quot;

You watch as **Gator #3**-a squat, twitchy banana beast with **a wild gleam in its eye**-**whips into an unexpected slipstream**, launching into second place.

&gt; &quot;Snack Pack is frothing at the snout! That one's been drinking protein juice and conspiracy theories, folks!&quot;

There's a moment where it looks like Snack Pack might take the win... but **Uncle Steve**, looking very tired but incredibly focused, **powers through the final corner and edges him out.**

&gt; &quot;AND THAT'S IT-UNCLE STEVE TAKES FIRST! SNACK PACK A CLOSE SECOND! Gator-ade... well, Gator-ade just ate the track divider.&quot;

A few people around you groan. Others cheer.

Your snail terminal chirps again.

&gt; **&quot;Congratulations! You placed 50 Berri on a 2nd Place Finish! You win 100 Berri! Thank you for betting with Rain Dinners!&quot;**

You retrieve your **winnings** in a small, tastefully designed pouch labeled *&quot;HOUSE FAVORITE.&quot;*

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Cash out and casually follow the rumor about the &quot;woman in blue.&quot; Could be Vivi.}

**CRITICAL OUTCOME: SNACK PACK WINS!**

---

You spin on your heel, daiquiri in one hand, a pouch of crisp berri in the other, and slap palms with the first person you see-an elderly man in a frilly sun hat who's holding a fake crocodile tail as a good luck charm.

&gt; &quot;Let's gooooooo!&quot;

He cackles in delight.

&gt; &quot;Snack Pack?! You madman, I *knew* someone else had the instincts!&quot;

With the gator arena roaring, you confidently march up to the snail terminal and tap in:

&gt; ð¸ **Wager Confirmed: 300 Berri on Gator #3 - Snack Pack**  
&gt; &quot;Snack Pack's juiced up and ready for redemption.&quot;

The race begins almost immediately-announcer's voice screaming over the excited crowd:

&gt; &quot;AND THEY'RE OFF! LOOK AT THAT BEAST GO! SNACK PACK IS-IS HE BITING THE *OTHER* GATORS?!&quot;

Indeed, Gator #3 is thrashing through the water like a **green missile** on a sugar bender. He launches past Goldfang, headbutts Munchie, and does a *frighteningly graceful barrel roll* around the final bend.

&gt; &quot;This is madness! This is illegal in three Blue Seas!&quot;

Then-

**He surges forward. Hits the finish line. Leaves waves and a bitten floating saddle behind him.**

The crowd goes *bananas*.

&gt; &quot;AND IT'S SNACK PACK BY A SNOUT! BY A SNOUT!!&quot;

The announcer slams his snail mic on the table and shouts toward the betting booths:

&gt; &quot;SOMEONE GET THAT GATOR A SPA.&quot;

Your terminal glows warmly.

&gt; **&quot;Congratulations, esteemed guest! Your 300 Berri bet on a 1st Place Finish has returned 1,200 Berri. Thank you for believing in Snack Packâ¢. Your payout will be delivered in gold-stamped token pouches shortly.&quot;**

Two **casino attendants** in crocodile vests approach and hand you a velvet pouch with **gold lettering**.

---

**ð YOU WON BIG!**
- ð Gator: SNACK PACK (1st Place)  
- ð° Payout: +1,200 Berri (Total: 1,300 Berri in your pouch now)  
- ð² Reputation: You are now noticed by gamblers and staff alike  
- ð Eyes are starting to follow you-not suspicious, just... *interested*

---

**Overheard nearby, during the roar of celebration:**

- **&quot;Yo... who's that guy?&quot;**  
- **&quot;He's new. Real lucky. Cheng, I think. From the upper floors.&quot;**  
- **&quot;Yeah, but that ain't just luck. That's *instinct.*&quot;**  
- **&quot;Watch him. If he wins again, alert the pit boss.&quot;**

And-

&gt; &quot;That woman's not a metaphor, idiot. She was in blue, with royal earrings. Looked like someone off the Wanted List... but prettier.&quot;

A nearby security guard glances at you briefly... then turns back toward his comm.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Bet again-big win energy. Try to break the house. Might attract... very interesting attention.}
2. {Play it cool. Thank the staff, cash out, and head toward the VIP floor where Nami may be.}
3. {Follow the lead about the &quot;woman in blue.&quot; Maybe it *wasn't* a figure of speech.}
4. {Chat with the lucky old man. See if he knows more about the casino's secrets.}
5. {Use your new &quot;celebrity&quot; to bluff your way into a restricted area. &quot;High roller perks, yeah?&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Who the hell is blue hair, anyways? Probably dyed. Probably a dancer, or something.

Option 1 - I feel it. Snack Pack is my brother from another mother... 1000 Beris on Snack Pack!

---

&gt; &quot;A thousand. On Snack Pack.&quot;

Silence at the betting booth. The snail terminal almost *glitches*.

The attendant behind the kiosk lowers their sunglasses just enough to make awkward eye contact.

&gt; &quot;Uh... you sure?&quot;

You just smile, casually toss your winning pouch on the counter, and press confirm.

&gt; &quot;That gator is my *spirit animal.* Ride or die.&quot;

The crowd around the Banana Gator RumbleDome has shifted-they're not just watching the race anymore.

They're watching **you.**

&gt; &quot;LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, WE HAVE A REPEAT GAMBLER-THE HIGH ROLLER OF ROOM 703!  
SNACK PACK'S #1 FAN HAS RETURNED!!&quot;

Spotlights sweep toward you as the arena announcer hypes the crowd. Gamblers throw up signs. Someone actually chants:

&gt; &quot;SNACK-PACK! SNACK-PACK! SNACK-PACK!&quot;

You give a small, confident nod to your elderly high-five friend, who is now holding up two crocodile tails in salute.

---

**THE RACE:**

Snack Pack, now clearly vibrating with **too much banana gator rage** to be healthy, launches from the gate like a **sea cannonball**. He snaps at Goldfang's tail, flips Uncle Steve **onto the decorative sandbank**, and somehow **surfs on the wake** of another gator for a full quarter lap.

It's madness.

&gt; &quot;SNACK PACK IS A MONSTER!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;IS HE FLOATING? HE'S FLOATING.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;SWEET MERCIFUL ROGER, HE'S *DOING A VICTORY TWIRL!*&quot;

The crowd explodes. **Snack Pack wins. Again.**  
Not by a snout this time-by **half a lap.**

The announcer throws their boa into the stands and shouts:

&gt; &quot;I have *no idea* what's in that gator's veins, but someone get me a towel and a therapist!!&quot;

---

**ð YOU WIN - MASSIVELY**

- ð° Wager: 1,000 Berri  
- ð¥ Payout (3:1 odds due to wild behavior): **3,000 Berri**  
- ð¼ Total Winnings: **4,300 Berri** (1,300 from earlier + 3,000 now)  
- ð£ Reputation: **High Roller - Cheng of 703**  
- ðµï¸ââï¸ Security Eyes: On You (Neutral-Alert Status)  
- ð¦´ Snack Pack: Clearly going feral with joy. Possibly overfed. Definitely your spiritual mount.

---

**As the crowd erupts, two significant things happen:**

1. A **well-dressed pit boss** in gold-trimmed attire begins making his way toward you. Smiling. But **not smiling with his eyes.**

2. You catch the faintest movement near the **casino's side corridor**. A flash of **royal blue cloth**, followed by **a silver earring shaped like a royal crest.** The person vanishes down a restricted hallway.

&gt; *Okay. Not a dancer.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Hold court. Accept the pit boss's attention and see what &quot;congratulations&quot; really means.}
2. {Slip away casually and follow the woman in blue. That wasn't a dancer. That was royalty.}
3. {Try to get backstage-&quot;My gator's on fire and I want to feed him personally.&quot; Use your fame as cover.}
4. {Grab the winnings, fake a phone call, and **vanish into the crowd**. Something's about to shift.}
5. {Buy snacks for the crowd and announce you'll bet again. Build a following. Use it later.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Waitress! daiquiris for everyone, put it on my tab! I wave magnanimously at the gathered gamblers.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Daiquiris for *everyone!*&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Loud, Generous, Gloriously Distracting | Mood: Riding High on Gator Glory**  
**ð² Influence Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +2 Current Fame, +1 Juice Aura) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You don't just win the crowd-you *own* the moment. You are now *a casino folk hero*.**

---

You step forward, raising your daiquiri like **a hero returning from sea**, the crowd still roaring from Snack Pack's brutal aquatic victory.

&gt; &quot;Waitress!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;**Daiquiris for everyone!** Put it on my tab!&quot;

A collective gasp, followed by a **howl of celebration**, erupts through the Banana Gator RumbleDome. Glasses clink, arms fly in the air, and at least three people start chanting your name incorrectly.

&gt; &quot;*CHUNG! CHUNG! CHUNG!*&quot;  
&gt; &quot;It's Cheng, you desert raisins!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;CHENG! CHENG! CHENG!&quot;

The waitress gives you a stunned look, then grins and salutes with her tray.

&gt; &quot;Right away, Mr. Cheng!&quot;

Servers scramble into action. Snail bartenders start lining up daiquiris in rapid succession, trays of glowing glasses fanning out like wings of a party god. One woman faints. A man proposes to his date. Another guy starts crying, whispering:

&gt; &quot;That man... that man *believed in Snack Pack.*&quot;

You wave magnanimously, the gold-lettered velvet pouch of your winnings tucked subtly beneath your travel jacket. You've created **a perfect social smokescreen**.

The pit boss stops mid-step.

He sees the crowd chanting. The daiquiris flowing. The building momentum of an unscripted legend-and, perhaps wisely, decides now's *not* the time to crack down on the high roller who's turned the casino floor into a party zone.

He nods stiffly and pulls back. For now.

---

**ð Game State Update:**

- ð° Berri: 4,300  
- ð·ï¸ Reputation: &quot;*The Juice High Roller of 703*&quot;  
- ð Status: Untouchable (for now) - No one wants to interrupt the guy who just **created an economy of daiquiris**  
- â&nbsp;ï¸ But security is still watching. Smiling. Letting you play. The kind of smile that means *&quot;we'll remember this.&quot;*

---

**While the daiquiris flow and gators rest, you catch a flash again-**the **woman in blue** slipping behind a false wall near a **&quot;Staff Only&quot; corridor** by the aquarium exit. She's moving fast now.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now's your chance. Use the distraction to follow the woman in blue. Everyone's looking at you-not where you're going.}
2. {Keep playing the hero. Talk to gamblers, start planting seeds-ask about weird events, Crocodile sightings, or disappearances.}
3. {Approach the pit boss directly. &quot;Got a suite full of gator tokens. Care to comp a bottle of something aged?&quot; Feel him out.}
4. {Disappear. Quietly. Slip back toward the suite or a service hallway while the party shields your exit.}
5. {Take the stage. Make a toast. Build full social dominance. It's absurd-but it might give you god-tier influence in Rain Dinners.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Keep an eye on that staff only corridor. Good sir, do you have something more... Vintage? I'd like to treat my new friends here, I wave at the crowd.

And snack pack, of course.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;A vintage for the people. And the gator.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Gentleman Gambler | Public Image: Benevolent Baron of the Gator Ring**  
**ð² Social Roll - Charm Offensive (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 High Roller Aura, +1 Crowd Favor) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Pit Boss Resistance - (Cautious +2, Momentarily Overwhelmed -1) = Result: 1 [Average]**  
**â Outcome: Success - You gain access to the pit boss's trust, taste something rare, and keep a close eye on the staff corridor.**

---

The daiquiris are still flowing, the crowd still roaring, and somewhere behind you, **Snack Pack** is attempting to climb out of the tank to receive the affection of his new god.

You turn, just in time to intercept the **pit boss**, whose gold-trimmed suit is sweating with regret. He forces a professional smile as you approach, raising your glass high.

&gt; &quot;Good sir,&quot; you begin smoothly, nodding with the practiced grace of someone who once taught **an etiquette unit to fifteen-year-olds with throwing stars.**  
&gt; &quot;Do you have something more... *vintage*? I'd like to treat my new friends here.&quot;

You gesture dramatically toward the **half-drunken daiquiri horde**, now singing a song that may or may not include the lyrics:

&gt; &quot;HE'S THE JUICE, THE FRUIT, THE CROC-SUIT FLUTE-CHENG!&quot;

Even the pit boss, a man who has probably seen **fire-eaters**, **con men**, and **live octopus auctions**, falters. Then clears his throat.

&gt; &quot;Ahem. Mr. Cheng. Of course. We appreciate a guest with such... festive flair.&quot;

He signals to a passing server and mutters into her ear.

&gt; &quot;Bring the... Mizu Gold '27.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The entire bottle, sir?&quot; she replies, eyes wide.

&gt; &quot;He just gave away 50 daiquiris and won 3,000 berri betting on a *psychotic reptile*, didn't he? Yes. The bottle.&quot;

She dashes off, and the pit boss steps closer.

&gt; &quot;I've never seen a guest build that kind of... momentum before. If there's *anything* you need, Mr. Cheng-private lounge, more tokens, even a little extra *luck* on your side...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Well, we take care of our winners.&quot;

His tone lowers, just slightly. Eyes sharp.

&gt; &quot;But... it's worth mentioning. Our staff areas are *off-limits.* Just in case you get... *curious.* You understand.&quot;

---

**At the same time-**

Your eyes flick over his shoulder, just as the **&quot;Staff Only&quot; corridor** opens briefly to admit a figure in blue. **Royal blue**, with gold trim. She's quick, covering her face now. *Definitely not a dancer.*

**Definitely that woman.**

And-**she was carrying something. A satchel. Possibly a map.**

The door seals shut. Unmarked. But you now know **exactly** where it is.

---

**Shortly after-**

The server returns with a **black velvet bottle**, the cork sealed in gold wax.

&gt; **Mizu Gold '27 - Aged Sparkling Sake from Water 7**  
&gt; &quot;Notes: peach blossom, stonefruit, rare as hell, used in noble ceremonies. Last bottle in Rainbase.&quot;

She pours a single glass. You raise it toward the crowd. They cheer like Snack Pack just got elected King of the Sea.

Snack Pack slaps the tank wall twice in approval.

---

**ð Updates:**

- ð Influence: Skyrocketed. You're now considered *casino elite*.  
- ð¥ Beverage Acquired: **Mizu Gold '27** - you can sip it, use it as leverage, or gift it for max social gain.  
- ðµï¸ You know exactly where the **Staff Only corridor** is-and how to reach it if you need to.  
- â&nbsp;ï¸ Pit Boss is friendly... but *watching you closely now.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Excuse yourself with a smile and slip into the staff corridor. The crowd will cover your departure.}
2. {Invite the pit boss to share a glass. See if he lets something slip under the pretense of friendly conversation.}
3. {Keep entertaining. Announce a final bet, then disappear while the floor is cheering again.}
4. {Send the Mizu Gold to Snack Pack. Cause a riot of adoration. Total legend move.}
5. {Feign intoxication, wander near the staff corridor &quot;by accident,&quot; and test the reaction.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Hey, you're part of the crowd too. Have a glass! 

Keep eyeing the staff corridor. Ponder whether I should notify security. Something's going on there.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;C'mon, boss. Even gators need a drink now and then.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Toast with a Smile, Thoughts Behind the Eyes | Dual Action: Social Buy-in + Strategic Observation**  
**ð² Social Roll - Friendly Toast (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Nobility of Gesture, +1 Juice Aura) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Pit Boss's Guard - Lowering (Cautious +1, Loosened by Hospitality -2) = -1 [Terrible]**  
**â Outcome: He accepts. Starts talking. Your position is secure-but what you're seeing near the staff corridor is not.**

---

You hold up your crystal glass with just enough flair to look elegant, not pompous. The light catches on the Mizu Gold like **sunlight over a calm sea.**

&gt; &quot;Hey-you're part of this crowd too. What kind of host would I be if I didn't raise a glass with the man keeping this show running?&quot;

The pit boss hesitates-**a heartbeat too long**. You've seen that moment before, in nervous teachers on parent night. That little flicker of *&quot;am I still in control of this situation?&quot;*

Then, his shoulders drop ever so slightly. He chuckles. Takes the offered glass. Clinks it against yours.

&gt; &quot;To Rain Dinners,&quot; he says.

&gt; &quot;To Snack Pack,&quot; you counter, and the crowd howls with approval.

He sips. You sip. The flavor is exquisite-**stonefruit, dry plum, a breath of cherry blossom**. Expensive, elegant, and old.

&gt; &quot;This stuff was probably brewed when I still had two good knees,&quot; the pit boss mutters.

His tone eases. Eyes crinkle with the first *genuine warmth* you've seen. You keep the smile on your face... but your **mind never leaves that corridor**.

---

You glance over, subtle as a dewfall, watching the staff door through reflections in the **casino's polished decor**. And you notice:

- A **different staff member** stands outside the corridor now. Not in uniform. No name tag. Arms crossed. Not moving.
- Every time someone passes too close, he gently herds them away, like a living velvet rope.
- He's not watching the crowd. He's **listening.**

&gt; *Someone's in there, doing something that needs protection.*

**Should you notify security?**

You consider it.

**On one hand:**
- It's suspicious.
- She may be trespassing, smuggling, or worse.
- *You'd be doing the &quot;right&quot; thing.*

**On the other hand:**
- If that woman really is **royalty**, or worse, a **rebel**, security might respond violently.
- She could be here to sabotage Crocodile's operations-or expose them.
- And you're not supposed to know what you know. If you bring attention, *you bring it to yourself too.*

&gt; It's a gamble, alright. But so is everything in this place.

---

The pit boss glances toward the crowd, then back to you.

&gt; &quot;Y'know... you'd do well in management. You've got the... spark.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Ever think of staying in Rainbase longer than a vacation?&quot;

That *wasn't* just a compliment.

That was **a probe**.

---

**ð Updates:**

- ð¥ Pit boss trusts you, now sees you as potential &quot;insider&quot; material.
- ðµï¸ You've confirmed: someone is guarding that staff corridor. Something important is happening inside.
- âï¸ You are at a moral crossroad: to report... or to watch.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Keep playing the part. Laugh off the job offer, ask for a &quot;tour of the VIP suites&quot;-use it to steer closer to the staff corridor.}
2. {Say you need a restroom and &quot;get turned around&quot; toward the staff corridor. Test if the guard reacts.}
3. {Take the pit boss aside, mention the corridor, and say &quot;you thought you saw something.&quot; See how he handles the intel.}
4. {Say nothing. Stay and monitor. Watch who enters and exits the corridor next.}
5. {Excuse yourself politely. Head back to your suite, process this over a whiteboard and kiwi juice.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: Per canon, what is happening to the characters of note in this current scene?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **OOC Requested: Canon Character Status - &quot;Rainbase: Just Before the Trap&quot;**  
**Scene Context: You're in Rain Dinners Casino, just prior to Crocodile's trap springing on the Straw Hats.**

You're in the thick of one of the most **critical turning points** of the Alabasta arc. Here's where the **main players** are *canonically* at this very moment:

---

### **Straw Hat Pirates**
**Status: Infiltrating Rain Dinners | Minutes from being captured**

- **Luffy**, **Zoro**, **Nami**, **Usopp**, **Vivi**, and **Chopper** have entered Rain Dinners, attempting to locate and confront **Crocodile** directly.
- They are **not yet captured**, but are inside the structure-somewhere beneath the main casino floor.
- Their goal: Stop Operation Utopia by confronting Crocodile, hoping to force a confession or cut off the coup at its head.
- They are **moments away** from falling into the trap-the **Seastone cage beneath the casino**, suspended over a **Banana Gator pit**.
- **Sanji** is not with them. He has remained **outside, unnoticed**, acting as their backup.

---

### **Nefertari Vivi**
**Status: Active | Inside Rain Dinners | Splitting off from group**

- Vivi is traveling with the Straw Hats.
- She is *very likely the woman in blue you just saw.*
- She's likely moving independently from the others at this moment, attempting to locate her father (**King Cobra**) or intercept Baroque Works agents moving toward **Alubarna**.
- Her presence is not publicly known-if she's recognized, it would instantly trigger a political incident.
- She may be carrying **maps, intel, or the Poneglyph location details**, hoping to disrupt Crocodile's timing.

---

### **Crocodile (Mr. 0)**
**Status: At the heart of Rain Dinners | In control | Awaiting confirmation of Straw Hats' capture**

- Currently monitoring events from his **private suite or command chamber** beneath the casino.
- His Seastone trap is ready and soon to be triggered.
- Unaware of **Sanji's** separate position, but fully expecting the Straw Hats to take the bait.
- Not yet moving personally-waiting for the moment to **deliver his monologue and gloat.**

---

### **Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin)**
**Status: Shadowy presence | Possibly moving between locations**

- Likely aware of the Straw Hats' presence.
- Possibly aware of **Vivi** moving through the casino.
- She may or may not be coordinating with Crocodile *at this precise moment*-or *secretly watching from afar.*

---

### **Captain Smoker &amp; Tashigi**
**Status: Undercover | Inside Rain Dinners' lower level monitoring corridors**

- Smoker is using internal monitoring systems (visible to you earlier) to **observe Rain Dinners' operations**.
- He is **intentionally NOT intervening yet**-waiting to catch Crocodile with undeniable evidence of Baroque Works activity.
- Tashigi is likely close by, or recently separated. She may be attempting her own investigation or contacting Marine support.
- Neither are aware of **Sanji** or the full Straw Hat crew's strategy yet.

---

### **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**
**Status: Left the casino earlier | May return soon in disguise**

- His orders involve **tracking and intercepting Vivi** using his **Clone-Clone powers**.
- He may reappear at any moment in a different form.
- It is possible he's already disguised and moving through the building.

---

### **Your Current Position:**
- You are now **socially dominant** on the casino floor-considered a high-rolling guest.
- You are **near the exact corridor** Vivi just entered.
- If you act now, you may **intercept her** before capture or before Crocodile notices she's broken off from the others.
- Alternatively, you can **let events unfold**, playing the long game while the trap closes around them.

---

Let me know if you'd like a live timeline or how you'd like to diverge from canon (if at all).

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Hah! Management? You flatter me, no I'm just a humble schoolteacher. I enjoy inspiring kids you know?

I wave at the hooting crowd.

In a way, these are kids too. I raise my drink and yell out a toast to Snack Pack's glory.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Just a humble schoolteacher... who's currently the king of the gator pit.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Heartfelt, Humble, Heroic | Status: Peak Crowd Control**  
**ð² Toast Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +2 Earnest Charm, +1 Public Standing) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You own the moment completely. You become *Rain Dinners legend*. You buy time, build clout, and steer attention away from Vivi's corridor.**

You give a soft chuckle at the pit boss's &quot;management&quot; offer, shaking your head like you just got asked to headline the Grand Line's Got Talent tour.

&gt; &quot;Hah! Management? You flatter me, sir-  
No, I'm just a humble schoolteacher.&quot;

The pit boss raises a brow. You continue, letting your tone shift into something gentle, proud.

&gt; &quot;I enjoy inspiring kids, you know?&quot;

You lift your glass, glancing around the crowd. The gamblers, the servers, the thrill-chasers and deadbeat drifters-some barely older than your students, others emotionally stunted by years of betting slips and lost dreams.

&gt; &quot;In a way... these are kids too.&quot;

And then-**you step onto the raised lip of the Banana Gator tank**, glass held high.

&gt; &quot;TO SNACK PACK!&quot; you bellow, voice cutting through the air like a shining blade of citrus truth.  
&gt; &quot;May his scales always shimmer, and his snack game always stay *juiced!*&quot;

The room erupts.

**Daiquiris fly. Toasts are shouted. Gator tails slap the water in violent agreement. Someone throws confetti. Snack Pack lets out a triumphant grunt and slaps his flipper to the tank wall in perfect synch with your raised glass.**

The pit boss just laughs and takes a long drink of Mizu Gold '27.

&gt; &quot;You're something else, Mr. Cheng.&quot;

---

**RESULT:**
- You've bought **time**. **Attention is off you**, off the staff corridor, and fixed on your glorious, gator-loving self.
- The **guard at the staff corridor** relaxes slightly. Less tense. Less alert.
- The **pit boss** is now emotionally invested in your narrative. He won't act against you unless absolutely necessary.
- You've secured your role as **casino royalty**-a local legend, a mysterious teacher, a high-rolling gambler who drinks like a noble and bets like a fool.

---

**Your options are now even wider than before. What you do next may determine how deeply you get involved in Vivi's fate... or Crocodile's downfall.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {While the crowd celebrates, slip into the staff corridor after Vivi. No one will notice now.}
2. {Keep playing the high roller-start asking about &quot;rare guests,&quot; &quot;closed corridors,&quot; or anything involving the royal family.}
3. {Excuse yourself quietly and send a message to Smoker via Kiwi Juice. &quot;Something's going down. Woman in blue.&quot;}
4. {Find a quiet spot to follow Vivi's trail more subtly-perhaps even use your fruit to sense water trail residue.}
5. {Invite the pit boss to a drink in your suite. See what kind of dirt he spills behind closed doors.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - excuse myself, say I need to use the gentlemen's room. Look for Smoker (or maybe bump into Tashigi)

OOC: I know of Smoker from the news, but not Tashigi.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Excuse me, nature calls... also, time to find a chain-smoking Marine.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Polite Disengagement + Covert Intent | Status: VIP Free Roaming Access**  
**ð² Social Disengage Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Party Credit, +1 Pit Boss Favor) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Search Roll - (Eatone +1 Careful, +1 Knowledge of Smoker's Habits, +1 Devil Fruit Juice Sense) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You disengage smoothly and head toward the aquarium corridors. You do not find Smoker... but you *do* find Tashigi.**

---

You clink your glass with the pit boss one last time and offer a perfectly-timed, totally-believable out:

&gt; &quot;Excuse me, sir-must make a quick stop at the gentlemen's room. All these daiquiris, you know.&quot;

He chuckles, gestures lazily with his glass.

&gt; &quot;Don't fall in. And tell Snack Pack I said hi.&quot;

You slip through the crowd like a sand eel, nodding at smiling patrons as you meander toward the **aquarium wing**-where you first glimpsed Smoker earlier. You pass the regular restrooms, but your focus isn't on porcelain thrones.

It's on **finding the Marine ghost watching this place from the shadows.**

---

### ð§ Kiwi Juice Sense Activated - Micro-moisture Tracking  
- You let a light mist of your Devil Fruit's juice trail around your collarbone and earlobes-*tuned for tobacco tang and high body heat.*
- You catch a faint, lingering humidity signature... then something fresher: **polished metal**, **warm footsteps**, **sword oil**.

You round a corner into a **dim corridor behind the aquarium's service tanks**, where the neon lights fade into cold blue, and tourists aren't allowed.

And there-**you nearly collide with her**.

---

### **You have encountered: Tashigi**  
- **Marine Lieutenant (Junior Grade)**  
- Wearing a brown officer's coat and sword strapped at her hip.  
- Glasses slightly askew.  
- Currently holding a **Den Den Mushi in one hand**, pacing, whispering-unaware of you until the very last moment.

She spins as you round the corner, instantly dropping into a **low-ready combat stance**, sword half-drawn.

&gt; &quot;Stay back!&quot; she snaps.  
&gt; &quot;This hallway is off-limits-show me your identification! Who are you?!&quot;

---

**OOC Notes:**
- Your character **does not know her by name**, only recognizes **the Marine insignia and swordsmanship posture**.
- She is **not currently aggressive**, just defensive-caught off guard mid-investigation.
- You still have your **&quot;Cheng, VIP Room 703&quot; identity** if you want to play dumb-or come clean.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {&quot;Whoa, whoa-VIP guest! Cheng. I got turned around looking for the bathroom. Honest mistake.&quot; Keep cover.}
2. {&quot;I'm Eatone. I'm a teacher and freelance bounty hunter. I know who your boss is. I think we're on the same side here.&quot; Break cover.}
3. {Use your Devil Fruit to send a juice-thread message around the corner: &quot;Straw Hats. Vivi. East corridor. Rain Dinners trap.&quot;}
4. {Play confused, stall, and see if she'll slip intel. &quot;What's going on here, anyway?&quot;}
5. {Backpedal fast and vanish. You didn't get caught. Don't blow your position yet.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Whoa, holy shit, lady! Easy on the sword! Back off, Nearly spill my drink in the process. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Whoa! Holy shit, lady!&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Alarmed Tourist + Clumsy VIP | Cover Identity: Fully Maintained (Cheng, Room 703)**  
**ð² Bluff Roll - (Eatone +2 Performance, +1 Plausible Distraction, +1 Drink As Prop) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Suspicion Roll - (+2 Protocol, -2 Flustered) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**â Outcome: SUCCESS - Tashigi stands down, realizes you're not a threat, and apologizes while staying wary.**

---

You throw your free hand up as you **stumble back dramatically**, daiquiri sloshing in your grip like a tiny tidal wave of alcohol-based innocence.

&gt; &quot;**Whoa-holy shit, lady!** Easy on the sword!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;I'm just-*I'm just trying to find the bathroom!*&quot;

You **nearly spill the Mizu Gold**, managing to save it only by **tilting your wrist at the last second** like a seasoned juice handler.

The blue light glints off your glass. You widen your eyes. Throw in a little breathy panic. The full package.

Tashigi freezes.

&gt; &quot;I-oh.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;I thought-dammit.&quot;  
&gt; She pushes her glasses up, cheeks coloring with embarrassment.

&gt; &quot;Sorry. Sorry. You're-one of the VIPs?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Room 703,&quot; you mutter, shaking your head, &quot;and I am **not** paid enough to get impaled in the dark by a Marine. I teach kids. I'm on vacation. I drink daiquiris and bet on gators.&quot;

She lowers the sword, still frowning, but clearly rattled.

&gt; &quot;Right. Sorry again. We've had... security issues. There's been movement through the staff corridors, unauthorized agents, and possibly infiltrated personnel. I thought you were-&quot;

She stops herself. You see her mentally slam the brakes.

&gt; &quot;Never mind. It's classified.&quot;

---

She steps aside, eyes still flicking toward her Den Den Mushi as it hums silently in standby.

You notice her coat isn't fully buttoned. There's a **Marine logbook** half-tucked into her pocket, and the hilt of her sword is freshly oiled. **She's in the middle of something**, but your harmless act just bought you a conversation-*if you want it.*

---

**Tashigi - Current Mood: Flustered | Wary | Apologetic**  
**You - Still Cheng, VIP, Daquiri King**  
**Environment - Dim corridor near aquarium systems, no civilians nearby**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {&quot;Look, I won't ask about your mission... but you just confirmed there is one. Tell me-should I get out of here?&quot;}
2. {&quot;Okay, okay. But if you're dealing with infiltration... I might've seen something.&quot; Offer vague tip about the blue-cloaked woman.}
3. {&quot;Hey, are you working with that white-haired guy? Smokes two cigars? Looked like a government guy.&quot; Feel her out.}
4. {Apologize again, bow out, and disappear toward the staff corridor before she regains her edge.}
5. {&quot;No worries. Just... maybe next time don't draw steel near the guy holding vintage sake.&quot; Play it off, lighten the mood, try to chat more.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - You, you're a marine right? I was going to tell casino security, but they're giving me the creeps. I saw a blue haired woman sneaking into the staff only corridor near the bananagator racing pens. Pretty sure she wasn't staff.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;Yeah, I was gonna tell security-but you don't have that look.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Reluctant Informant + Bounty Hunter Instincts | Credibility Boosted by Prior Bluff**  
**ð² Truth Drop Roll - (Eatone +2 Sincerity, +1 Observational Accuracy, +1 Marine Recognition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Reaction - (+2 Professionalism, -1 Guilt from Overreaction, +1 Cross-Referencing) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: Strong Success - You're believed instantly. Tashigi refocuses and reacts decisively.**

---

You lower your voice and glance over your shoulder, like someone **used to carrying secrets** but not enjoying it.

&gt; &quot;You, you're a Marine, right?&quot;

Tashigi nods once, still catching her breath.

&gt; &quot;I was gonna tell casino security about something weird I saw. But honestly?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;They're giving me the creeps. Like they're smiling with teeth too sharp.&quot;

Her eyes sharpen. You continue, clear, careful.

&gt; &quot;There was a **blue-haired woman**. Slipped through a **staff-only door** near the **Banana Gator pens**-not wearing a uniform, not acting like she belonged. Carried something under her arm, maybe a satchel or a case. Real fast. Real quiet.&quot;

You don't embellish. Just deliver the truth, plain and clean.

Tashigi blinks.

Then she **snaps into motion**.

&gt; &quot;What direction exactly?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;What color was the satchel? Blue-navy blue? Black? Did she have earrings? Anything else?&quot;

She's in **investigator mode now**-replaying intel in her head.

&gt; &quot;Blue hair, possible royal signature...&quot; she mutters to herself.  
&gt; &quot;It can't be... but if it is-she's here, then the Straw Hats-&quot;

She stops, realizing she's almost talking out loud.

&gt; &quot;You did the right thing. I'm... sorry for earlier. You're not the only one caught up in something bigger.&quot;

She glances back down the hallway, then curses under her breath.

&gt; &quot;Listen-if you see *anyone* in a white suit with a golden crocodile pin acting like they don't blink-avoid them.  
They don't answer to this casino.&quot;

Then she taps the Den Den Mushi in her hand.

&gt; &quot;Captain,&quot; she murmurs, voice low. &quot;Possible ID on the princess. I'm going after her.  
If I don't check in in five minutes, assume contact has been made.&quot;

She clicks it shut and turns to you, serious now.

&gt; &quot;Cheng, right? Stay in the public spaces. Whatever's going on, you don't want to be in the splash zone.&quot;

---

**ð INFO GAINED:**

- Tashigi **believes you completely.**
- The woman you saw *is likely Nefertari Vivi.*
- Tashigi is **now in pursuit** of her and possibly the Straw Hats.
- The **&quot;white suit, gold crocodile pin&quot; staffers** are *not* casino employees-likely Baroque Works elite.
- Smoker is listening. And now he knows **you're involved**, even if you didn't say your real name.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Say nothing, let her go-but quietly follow. You're invested now, and this is bigger than gambling.}
2. {Head back to the casino. You've done your part-time to lay low and pretend to be the juice-sipping VIP again.}
3. {Contact Enzo again. Report that Marines are in play, Crocodile's crew is posing as staff, and that Vivi may be here.}
4. {Slip toward the staff door while Tashigi's focused. You might find more before she does.}
5. {Turn and leave-but leave behind a juice marker. If she gets into trouble, you'll know.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - excuse me, Ma'am?

I pull out my bounty hunter's license. 

Independent hunter, Eatone Cheng. There's something off today, and I'm worried about you wandering into what might be the lion's den by yourself. Would you like assistance?

OOC: Tashigi is prideful, may turn down support. Also might see it as a slight since she's a woman.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Excuse me, Ma'am... I might not be a Marine, but I've got juice.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Earnest, Respectful, Subtly Protective | Playing the Card: Licensed Bounty Hunter Offer**  
**ð² Diplomacy Roll - (Eatone +2 Sincerity, +1 Professionalism, +1 Risk Framing) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Pride Filter - (+2 Independent Streak, -1 Acknowledging Real Danger, +1 Respect for Proper Procedure) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: SUCCESS - She turns you down... but doesn't dismiss you. You've earned her respect.**

---

She's halfway down the hallway when you call out-calm, respectful.

&gt; &quot;Excuse me, Ma'am?&quot;

She halts, turning on a dime. You step closer, not too close, and reach into your inner coat pocket-not the side with the baton.

You produce a thin **denim-bound wallet**, flipping it open to reveal your **Bounty Hunter's License**-stamped, registered, **Grand Line Certified**, complete with your signature and the slightly faded watermark of a Kiwi slice in the corner.

&gt; &quot;Name's **Eatone Cheng**. Independent hunter. When I'm not teaching kids how not to fall into desert heatstroke, I do field work.&quot;

You slide the license back into your coat.

&gt; &quot;There's something *off* about tonight. The staff, the setups, the *way it feels like the whole place is waiting to snap.*&quot;

Your tone remains even. Not challenging. Just... honest.

&gt; &quot;And I know you're a Marine. Probably above my pay grade.  
But I'm offering. If you want a second pair of eyes-not as a bodyguard, not because you're a woman-but because **I've seen lion dens before**... and this smells like one.&quot;

For a moment, Tashigi says nothing. Just studies you.

Her expression flickers: pride, frustration, something close to gratitude-but locked tight behind that Marine posture.

She adjusts her glasses. Steps forward.

&gt; &quot;You're good,&quot; she says quietly. &quot;You're *too* good. If I were any other agent, I might've pulled you in already.&quot;

Then-she reaches into her coat and flashes her own ID:  
**Lt. Tashigi, Marine Intelligence, Captain Smoker's Office.**

&gt; &quot;And *I* walk into lions' dens because sometimes there's cubs inside. Innocents.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;So... no. I can't accept your help. Officially.&quot;

A pause. Then, softer:

&gt; &quot;But... if I don't come back through that hallway in ten minutes, Cheng... well... do what bounty hunters do.&quot;

She pivots, strides away, and vanishes into the corridor, sword gleaming in the pale blue light.

---

**ð Status Update:**

- You are now known by name to **Tashigi**.
- She respects you-even if she can't take you with her.
- She's walking into the unknown, and she knows it.
- You are now her **unofficial backup**.
- Smoker likely knows your name by now through her channel.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait. Ten minutes. If she doesn't come back, follow her trail.}
2. {Mark the hallway with juice-if she runs, you'll trace the splash. Then return to the casino floor casually.}
3. {Head to the suite. Prep. Juice-armor, traps, a map. You might be going in after her.}
4. {Go to the staff corridor now. Quietly. Carefully. If it's bad, she'll need help faster than ten minutes.}
5. {Contact Enzo again. You have a name, a title, and a possible warlord's base of operations.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Return to the Bananagator pens, near the corridor. Ready to respond in 10 minutes. Or if I hear explosions.

Wave to the crowd as I return, and clink glasses with my newfound friends.

Observe. What did the guard next to the corridor do when Tashigi approached?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Ten-minute countdown. If there's screaming, I'm sprinting.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Watchful Guest | Internal Readiness: Battle-On-A-Hair-Trigger**  
**ð² Stealth Return Roll - (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Social Camouflage, +1 Route Familiarity) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Observation Roll - (Eatone +2 Careful, +1 Juice-Sense, +1 Experience Watching Shady Adults at School Events) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**â Outcome: You return unnoticed, perfectly reintegrate into the crowd, and *notice everything.*

---

You wait ten seconds after Tashigi disappears-*just enough time to let the quiet hang like a held breath.*

Then, you turn and **casually retrace your path** back toward the casino floor, daiquiri still in hand, stride even, gaze soft. No one gives you a second look. **You're Cheng. The daiquiri king. Gator god. Room 703.**

As you step through the archway into the familiar chaos of the **Banana Gator RumbleDome**, the crowd is still riding the high of your last toast. The servers have brought out **free snack trays** in your honor. Someone's fashioned a **Snack Pack mask out of cocktail napkins**.

&gt; &quot;Heyyy, he's back!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;CHENG! GATOR KING!&quot;

You wave, grin, and clink glasses with two enthusiastic fans-one wearing a gator tail hat, the other just **vibing way too hard to flute jazz.**

You gently **steer yourself to a small table** near the arena's edge-specifically, one with **full line-of-sight** to the **Staff Only corridor**.

---

### **Your Eyes Lock On the Guard**

He's still there.  
Same stance.  
Still looking too neutral.  
Still wearing no name tag.  
Still pretending to be invisible-but standing **like someone trained to fight.**

But here's what you **saw earlier**, now with fresh clarity:

&gt; When Tashigi approached the corridor...  
&gt; **He didn't stop her.**  
&gt; He *didn't even move.*  
&gt; No hand to a comm, no &quot;may I help you,&quot; no nothing.

He saw her coming. Saw the **Marine coat**, saw the **sword**, saw the **clearly non-tourist** energy-and chose to look away.

&gt; Which means either:
- He didn't recognize her and is criminally undertrained (unlikely).
- He **was told to let her pass**.
- Or **he was told not to interfere with anyone &quot;official looking.&quot;**

You also notice: the **door she went through hasn't opened since.**

---

**ð Time Check:**

- Tashigi went in **less than two minutes ago**.
- You are seated, fully reabsorbed into the crowd.
- The corridor is still quiet. Still guarded. Still *wrong.*

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Wait the full ten minutes. No action unless you hear something. Let the plan play out.}
2. {Start a distraction if needed-something to make the guard abandon post or react. Could be a false &quot;Gator Emergency.&quot;}
3. {Leave a Kiwi juice trail from the corridor into the hallway, so you can follow it faster later. Subtle prep.}
4. {Approach the guard under the guise of casual conversation. Feel him out-see if he's Baroque Works.}
5. {Use one of your new fans. Convince them to ask the guard &quot;where the VIP restroom is&quot; as a probe.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - I offer the guard a drink. Hey, from one working man to another, appreciate you keeping us safe.

OOC: I know nothing about Baroque works

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 4 Selected - &quot;Hey, man. Just keeping the vibes alive.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Friendly Guest | No Suspicion, Just Politeness | Hidden Probe Under Cover of Kindness**  
**ð² Social Approach Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 High Roller Aura, +1 No Suspicion of Baroque Works) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Guard's Reaction - (Trained +2, But Not Expecting Kindness -1) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: You disarm him with charm. He remains professional, but lets a *few things* slip.**

---

You swirl the last inch of your daiquiri and walk toward the corridor casually, like you're just stretching your legs before betting another thousand on your semi-possessed gator.

The guard doesn't react as you approach. Doesn't twitch, doesn't flinch. Just watches you with the same **calm stare you've seen on exasperated substitute teachers** trying to grade essays during a school fire drill.

You stop beside him-just enough distance not to crowd.

&gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; you say lightly.  
&gt; &quot;From one working man to another-appreciate you keeping us safe out here.&quot;

You offer the drink-not aggressively. Just... a friendly gesture from a guy with extra vintage and too much attention.

For a moment, he says nothing.

Then:

&gt; &quot;Appreciate that, sir. But I don't drink on post.&quot;

His voice is polite. Neutral. But you catch the **slight pause before &quot;sir.&quot;** Like he's choosing that word carefully. Like he's trained to.

He nods toward the tank, where **Snack Pack** is now getting a shoulder massage from an arena handler.

&gt; &quot;You've got the floor lit up tonight. Don't see many people treat staff with respect like that.&quot;

You keep the conversation casual.

&gt; &quot;Eh, it's just a vacation for me. School's out. Nice room, good drinks, freakishly athletic reptiles. What's not to love?&quot;

A tiny smile flickers across his face. You decide to test the waters.

&gt; &quot;So what's back there, anyway?&quot; you nod at the staff corridor.  
&gt; &quot;Employee lounge? Secret slot machines? Gator nap room?&quot;

His response is **quick**, smooth-but *too rehearsed*.

&gt; &quot;Just back-of-house logistics, sir. Tank access, kitchen intake, maintenance. Nothing for guests.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Mmh.&quot; You take a sip.  
&gt; &quot;Saw someone go in earlier. Long blue hair. Didn't look like staff.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...Probably security clearance. Some VIPs bring personal assistants. Escorts. Stylists.&quot;

Another smooth lie. But now you're listening closer.

He shifts his stance slightly, hand resting near his hip-not threateningly, just **habitually**, like there's something holstered there.

**Not a weapon. A Den Den Mushi. A communicator.**

---

**ð What You've Learned:**

- He's **not a casino employee**. Too rigid. Too professional.  
- He **recognized Tashigi as someone important**-but let her through without orders.
- The corridor leads to **more than just kitchens.** Possibly **Rain Dinners' internal control zone**.
- He's not aggressive. You aren't considered a threat. But if you were *suspicious*, he'd likely act fast.
- You're **earning trust**-and that means opportunity.

---

**Time Check: 4 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Corridor: Quiet. Door: Still Closed.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Continue the small talk. See if you can get his name, origin, or slip about his *real* employer.}
2. {Ask him what he thinks of the guy in charge here-&quot;Croco? I heard he's a war hero or something?&quot; See how he reacts.}
3. {Leave a tiny juice marker on his coat hem or boot. If he moves, you'll know.}
4. {Return to your table. Let him forget you. Watch for movement.}
5. {Ask if staff ever let VIP guests tour the &quot;logistics&quot; area. Play dumb. Maybe get an invite.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Hey, how about I get you a drink when you get off shift then? I'm sure you've got stories to share. I know I do.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;I'll toast you later, friend. Off the clock.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Charismatic, Disarming, *Strategic Friendship Offer***  
**ð² Social Roll - (Eatone +2 Rapport, +1 Casual Trust Offer, +1 âNot Threatening' Aura) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Guard's Response Roll - (Trained +1, Socially Underequipped -1) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**â Outcome: You catch him off guard, ease his stance, and learn just enough to confirm your instincts.**

---

You lean slightly closer-not menacing, just friendly-and lift your now-empty glass in a mock toast.

&gt; &quot;Hey, how about I get you a drink when you're off shift?  
I'm sure you've got some stories, yeah? Places like this... always have stories.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;I know I do.&quot;

There's a pause.

You expect a polite brush-off. But instead, his jaw shifts like someone grinding down a reflex.

&gt; &quot;...Heh. I'll think about it, sir.&quot;

He glances over at the crowd-still laughing, drinking, roaring as **Snack Pack body-slams a floaty gator toy** in an unprompted aquatic display of dominance.

&gt; &quot;Could probably use one. This place ain't exactly quiet lately.&quot;

He catches himself and straightens. Looks away, neutral again-but too late.

That one little comment?  
**He let something slip.**

And he knows it.

You keep it cool, just smiling.

&gt; &quot;I'll be around. Cheng. Room 703.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Look me up after clock-out.&quot;

He doesn't answer-but he doesn't say no. You walk away casually, returning to your spot, **a little richer in trust and intel.**

---

**ð What You Gained:**

- The guard has accepted you as **socially safe.** You're no longer just a guest-you're a &quot;harmless regular.&quot;
- He **confirmed instability behind the scenes** without meaning to. &quot;Place ain't quiet lately&quot; = pressure is building.
- He's on edge, but warming up. Might talk more *off shift*-a potential ally or leak later.
- Still never gave his name. That's deliberate.

---

**Time Check: 6 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Corridor: Still Quiet**  
**Guard: Relaxed, but alert. Eyes follow movement, especially VIPs.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Return to the bar. Prep to leave. If she doesn't come out soon... she might *not.*}
2. {Wait at your table. Eyes on the door. Two more minutes, then you act.}
3. {Create a distraction-shouting match, a staged banana spill, something to pull the guard's focus if you need a fast move.}
4. {Find one of the floor servers you tipped earlier. Quietly ask if there's another way into staff areas.}
5. {Send a trickle of juice beneath the corridor door. Just enough to scout. No combat-just surveillance.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Hey! When's the next race? Snack Pack craves blood! And wins! Mostly blood!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Snack Pack hungers for glory... and maybe a little bit of gator spleen.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Over-the-Top Gambler Energy | Intent: Crowd Distraction + Guard Misdirection**  
**ð² Distraction Roll - (Eatone +2 Performance, +2 Public Momentum, +1 Gator Fandom Cult Leader Status) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You create a full-scale crowd frenzy. Security attention shifts. The guard is momentarily compromised.**

---

You throw your arms up like a preacher channeling divine revelation through a tropical cocktail.

&gt; &quot;**HEY!**&quot; you shout across the Gator RumbleDome.  
&gt; &quot;When's the **next race?!** My boy **Snack Pack** craves **blood and glory**!  
AND WINS! MOSTLY BLOOD!!&quot;

The crowd **explodes.**  
Drinks slosh. Someone yells, &quot;**Snack Pack for the Shichibukai!**&quot;  
Another patron whips off their shirt and slaps it onto the tank glass like a banner of war.

The announcer-clearly still recovering from the last round-fumbles the golden snail mic:

&gt; &quot;U-UH-THE NEXT RACE BEGINS IN... TEN MINUTES! SPECIAL EXHIBITION ROUND!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;REPEAT: SNACK PACK WILL RACE-AGAINST THREE CHALLENGERS!&quot;

A **bell rings**, unprompted. Staff scramble. **Spotlights spin.**  
The crowd swells toward the arena edge, everyone jostling for position, drunk on juice, booze, and Snack Pack fever.

---

### **What Happens to the Guard:**

Your antics draw **every eye in the vicinity**, including his.

He turns his head.  
**Just a second too long.**

You see him reach for his Den Den Mushi-*maybe to report, maybe to listen in*-but it doesn't matter.

&gt; He's distracted.  
&gt; The corridor? **Unguarded. For the moment.**

---

**Time Check: 8 Minutes Since Tashigi Entered**  
**Crowd Status: Frenzied, Screaming for Gator Blood**  
**Corridor Status: Unwatched, Unlocked, Wide Open**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Slip into the corridor. Quiet, quick, just far enough to find Tashigi-or what's left of her.}
2. {Send a thread of juice beneath the door while everyone's distracted. Stealth recon.}
3. {Use your popularity to bluff deeper: &quot;As Snack Pack's sponsor, I demand a backstage tour!&quot;}
4. {Wait two more minutes. Tashigi said ten. Don't break the deal-yet.}
5. {Prep a juice escape route. Just in case you need to run-or fight-soon.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - 8 minutes ain't 10, but it ain't 0 either. Let's take a look. Leave a kiwi trail behind me for sensing and exfil.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;8 ain't 10... but it ain't nothin'. Let's move.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Covert, Focused, Professionally Cautious**  
**ð§ Devil Fruit Usage: Kiuikyuui JÅ«su JÅ«su no Mi - Trail Activated (Passive Sensing + Escape Route)**  
**ð² Stealth Roll - (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Distraction Field, +1 Juice Control) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You slip into the staff corridor completely unseen, trail in place. You are now in enemy space.**

---

The crowd continues **roaring Snack Pack's name** like they're about to vote him into Parliament. Drinks are flying. Security's preoccupied with **not getting trampled** by people throwing money at the betting terminals.

You slide toward the **Staff Only door**, still cracked slightly from earlier. The guard's gaze is locked on the announcer booth-he doesn't see you vanish inside.

With a subtle **snap of your fingers**, a thin trail of **kiwi juice threads from your heel**, back across the tile, glowing faintly only to you. It anchors to the base of a cleaning cart, where it will pulse softly if tugged from either side.

&gt; *Safety line secured. Teacher tactics engaged.*

---

**INTERIOR: Staff Corridor - Sublevel 1 Access Passage**  
- **Lighting:** Dim. Yellow halogen bulbs flickering occasionally.  
- **Sound:** Dripping pipes, faint hum of machinery, distant murmur of an aquarium pump.  
- **Smell:** Salt, oil, and faint antiseptic. Someone tried to cover up blood recently. Not very well.

The corridor stretches ahead, descending in a **gentle slope**-clearly designed for utility carts and maintenance access. Pipes line the walls. Security signs warn about **&quot;AUTHORIZED STAFF ONLY - Surveillance Active.&quot;**

You pass:

- A **locked supply room**  
- A **laundry intake chute**  
- A **maintenance panel** with fingerprints on it-recent.  
- And then... the **first real sign**:

### A scuff on the floor-**boot tread**, thin, regulation heel.

**Tashigi's trail.**

You follow, careful to keep your footfalls light. Every corner, you leave a fresh **sensing droplet** of kiwi juice, keeping a **light mental tether** to their location. You're maybe 25 meters in when you hear it:

&gt; **A grunt.**  
&gt; **Soft metal against concrete.**

You ease to the corner. Ahead is a **fork in the hallway**-one side leads to **central filtration** for the aquarium. The other toward **what looks like an elevator chamber**, its keypad **still flickering from recent input.**

And there-**on the floor near the filtration doorway**-you see her:

&gt; **Tashigi, crouched. Alive. Breathing hard. Bleeding from her temple. Sword half-drawn.**  
&gt; Her back is to the wall. Across from her lies the **unmoving body of a man in a casino staff uniform**-his coat open just enough to show a **Baroque Works tattoo on his ribs.**

She hasn't seen you yet. But she's **not unconscious**. She's waiting. **Cornered?** Laying a trap?

---

**ð Current Situation:**

- You are **25 meters into the staff corridor**, unseen.  
- **Kiwi trail active** for exfil or reinforcements.  
- **Tashigi is down but conscious**, recovering from a fight.  
- One **Baroque Works agent down**-unknown if dead.  
- You are **not yet engaged.** Full element of surprise.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Approach and identify yourself quietly. &quot;Cheng. I followed. You okay?&quot;}
2. {Stay hidden. Watch her for another 30 seconds. Maybe she's not alone.}
3. {Prepare a juice shield in advance. Enter visibly, but protected.}
4. {Check the Baroque Works agent first-see if he's dead or faking.}
5. {Retreat slightly. Juice-mark this chamber. Tashigi's alive. Time to get backup or go deeper.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 / 3. Lay in the shadows, but start accumulating kiwi juice in one hand, and draw my baton (unextended) in the other. Who knows what might happen.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2/3 Hybrid Selected - &quot;Stay low. Stay hidden. Juice in one hand. Baton in the other.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Predator's Patience | Internal: Fully Alert, Expecting Ambush**  
**ð² Stealth Hold Roll - (Eatone +2 Subtle, +1 Cautious Prep) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð² Juice Pooling Roll - (Eatone +1 Control, +1 Prepared Terrain, +1 Devil Fruit Focus) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Passive Perception Roll - (Eatone +2 Juice-Sense, +1 Combat Instinct) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**â Outcome: You're hidden, fully prepared, and you spot the threat *before it strikes.***

---

You slip into the shadows near a low **utility pipe** that runs along the ceiling drop-crouched just behind a rusted **ventilation grate**, vision perfect for this stretch of hallway. You let out a slow breath, calming your pulse, just like during *those &quot;parent-teacher meetings&quot; where the angry dads smelled like whiskey and poor choices.*

You extend your **left hand** just slightly, palm down, and begin pooling a tight, coiled orb of **high-density kiwi juice**, each drop refined and precise. A pale green glow begins to shimmer under your palm, like **liquid courage under moonlight.**

Your **right hand** slips to your baton-still collapsed, but Seastone tip ready to snap open with a flick. The grip is worn smooth from handling, like the edge of a desk you've rapped for silence a hundred times.

&gt; *Juice for shield or trap. Baton for things that don't respond to juice.*

You watch Tashigi from the shadows. She **hasn't seen you.**  
She's breathing steadily now. Her head turns, slowly scanning. She knows someone else *might* be nearby.

That's when your **juice-sense flares.**

Not from her. Not from the body.

&gt; From **above.**

Your breath catches.

The ceiling panel **three meters behind her**-one of the vent ducts-is **open.** Just slightly. **Condensation trails**-thin trickles of moisture out of place in the dry desert air-slither down the edge.

You hold your breath and shift your focus.

### There's someone **in the ceiling.**

Alive. Silent. Moving slow. Maybe **waiting to strike.** Maybe **already watching her.** Maybe **watching you.**

**You see a flash of black boot leather.**

Tashigi hasn't noticed. She's vulnerable.

You? You're **armed. Primed. Hidden.**  
And the air is getting **very, very still.**

---

**ð Tactical Summary:**

- You are **completely hidden.**  
- You have **a prepared ball of kiwi juice** (choice of shield, trap, or directed strike).  
- You have your **collapsed Seastone baton** in hand.  
- Tashigi is unaware of the ceiling threat.  
- You have **the jump. One clean action before they move.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Hurl the juice upward into the vent. Flush them out. Strike first.}
2. {Extend the baton *quietly*, prep for a physical ambush. Wait until they drop.}
3. {Use the juice to *trap the vent exit*, sealing them in with an adhesive flood.}
4. {Hiss softly: &quot;Marine-above you.&quot; Alert Tashigi. Lose surprise, gain ally readiness.}
5. {Split the juice-some into the vent, some into a wall trail to *listen* for movement inside. Buy yourself info.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Prime my juice hand, ready to launch a juicy surprise at whatever comes out of the ceiling.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Let 'em drop. I've got a juice-packed surprise with their name on it.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Silent Readiness | Stance: Predator in the Dark**  
**ð² Held Action - Juice Launch (Eatone +1 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Prepared Strike, +1 Surprise) = *Primed, Ready to Release***  
**ð² Environmental Check - Ceiling Panel Stability = Result: Loose. Unsecured.**  
**ð² Enemy Stealth Roll - (+2 Trained, -2 Moisture Signature) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**â Outcome: You've readied a perfect ambush. You're one move ahead. And they're about to drop into your strike zone.**

---

Your muscles coil with the stillness of a veteran field exam proctor who's just spotted the kid with a cheat sheet under the desk.

You don't move-not a flinch, not a breath.  
Your **juice orb grows**, dense and slightly steaming in your palm. You concentrate it down to a **tight, pulsing bundle** of semi-solid kiwi pressure. Thick with **natural acids and sticky fruit pulp**, it's ideal for one thing:

&gt; *Neutralizing targets without killing them. Unless they're allergic. In which case-oops.*

The air shifts.

The ceiling panel just above and behind Tashigi **creaks.**  
One **black-gloved hand** appears, gripping the edge. **Silent. Deliberate.**

Then a second hand.  
Then-**a masked face.**

White mask. Gold trim.  
A **Baroque Works elite agent.** You still don't know what that means... but it **sure as hell ain't a stylist.**

He moves with care-likely thinks Tashigi's too disoriented to detect him.

&gt; But he doesn't know *you're here.*

You see it:

- His **knife is drawn**.  
- He's about to drop onto her with **deadly precision.**  
- He's **three seconds from committing to the kill.**

---

**You may now release your held action.**

Choose how to launch the juice:

1. {Direct shot to the face - blind, sting, disorient. Disable immediately.}  
2. {Blast his hands - knock the knife loose, force him to fall unarmed.}  
3. {Spray the vent - cover the exit and seal it. Trap him before he drops.}  
4. {Launch upward and trigger a sticky *shockwave* in the vent. Flush him out hard.}  
5. {Let him fall. Hit him the *moment* he lands-less risk to ceiling, more drama.}

ð {Choose how you unleash the juice.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Kiwi away! Draw my baton and move in.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Kiwi Away!&quot;**  
**Action: Direct Strike to the Face | Follow-Up: Close Quarters Engagement**  
**ð² Attack Roll - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Aim, +1 Surprise, +1 Close Range) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Enemy Defense Roll - (+2 Trained Reflexes, -3 Didn't Know You Were There) = Result: -1 [Disastrous]**  
**â Outcome: Critical Ambush Success - He never sees it coming. You disable him instantly.**

---

As the **masked Baroque Works assassin** begins to drop, arms poised like a venomous spider falling from its silk-

&gt; **&quot;Kiwi away.&quot;**

You flick your wrist, and the dense, acidic orb of concentrated kiwi juice blasts from your palm with surgical force. The air ripples, the juice hisses, and the projectile **slams directly into his mask**.

&gt; *THWAP-SSSSHHHH-KRAK*

The impact is wet and sharp. The mask cracks down the middle. The acidic kiwi pulp **floods his eyes**, stinging, blinding, soaking the seams of his mask and armor with a **sticky, enzymatic coating**.

He doesn't scream-he *gurgles*.

He drops wildly from the vent-not a strike, not a lunge, but a **crash.**

Tashigi's eyes go wide as a body thuds to the floor next to her.

&gt; &quot;Wha-?!&quot;

Before the agent can even roll, you're **moving**-one step, two, **baton snapping open with a metal *CLACK*** as you swing around the corner and stride into full view.

&gt; *Teacher mode: activated.*

Your **Seastone-tipped baton** extends, cold and humming with lethality. You advance on the now-writhing assassin, who claws at his eyes, slipping on kiwi pulp as he tries to right himself.

Tashigi looks up from her position, blinking rapidly.

&gt; &quot;You...?!&quot;

You nod once, firm.

&gt; &quot;Cheng. Room 703. Just here to make sure nobody stabs a Marine in the back.&quot;

She blinks.

&gt; &quot;...That's a hell of a vacation.&quot;

---

### **Baroque Works Agent - Status: Disabled**
- Eyes: Blinded by acidic kiwi  
- Breathing: Labored  
- Weapon: Dropped  
- Current Action: *None. You have full control.*

Tashigi pushes herself upright, sword gripped tightly in one hand, the other holding her bruised temple.

&gt; &quot;Thanks. He was waiting. I didn't even hear him.&quot;

She eyes the **Seastone tip** of your baton.

&gt; &quot;That's not standard bounty hunter issue. You really a teacher?&quot;

&gt; *Only you answer that.*

---

**ð Combat Update:**
- One **hostile down**
- **Vent route cleared**
- Corridor now stable
- Tashigi is injured, but standing
- You are now an *active ally* in Marine eyes

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Tie the agent up. Begin questioning him with Tashigi. Fast and dirty.}
2. {Ask Tashigi what her mission is down here. You've earned a few answers.}
3. {Move further in. You've got momentum, and Baroque Works knows *something* went wrong.}
4. {Call your Marine contact-Enzo. Time to let someone know what you've walked into.}
5. {Use kiwi juice to lock the ceiling vent and reinforce the corridor behind you. No more surprises.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Lay more Kiwi juice. Then knock the Agent out for good measure.

Don't ask me about the price on the baton. I probably could've bought a small house in the east blue with it. You okay, ma'am?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Seal the route, clean the mess. Safety first, sass second.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Duty Over Drama | Mood: Collected, Gritty Professionalism**  
**ð² Juice-Lock Deployment - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Situational Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² KO Roll - Baton Strike (+2 Surprise, +1 Blinded Target) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You lock the corridor down tight, then send the agent to dreamland. Tashigi now sees you as an asset.**

---

You turn slightly, extend your hand again, and release a controlled stream of kiwi juice **along the ceiling vent's rim**, hardening it mid-flow with a practiced flick of your wrist. The juice thickens, seals, and **locks the vent** shut in a sticky lattice of hardened pulp and acidic residue.

&gt; *If anyone else wants to drop in uninvited, they're going to taste regret first.*

Satisfied, you turn back to the twitching Baroque Works agent, still groaning, mask half-melted and soaked in juice. He manages a weak, gurgled:

&gt; &quot;Gh-kkk... who the hell are y-&quot;

&gt; **CRACK.**

You don't answer.  
You just step in and deliver a precise, quick baton strike to the **side of the head**.  
**Non-lethal. Blunt. Clinical.**

He slumps instantly.  
**Unconscious.**

You kneel beside him, checking his pulse-strong but out cold. You grab his knife and toss it aside, noting its make: **obsidian-coated, finely balanced, clearly custom.** You keep it.

&gt; **[+1 Baroque Dagger - Non-standard issue. Lightweight. Possibly poisoned.]**

Then, you look to Tashigi as you holster your baton again with a sigh.

&gt; &quot;Don't ask me about the price on the baton.  
I could've bought a small house in the East Blue with it. Maybe even a yard.&quot;

She laughs softly-short and sharp, like she's still catching her breath.

&gt; &quot;That's... more than I paid for my sword.&quot;  
She touches her temple again, winces.

&gt; &quot;I'm okay. Took a hard elbow to the head and rolled into a wall. Nothing's broken. Just rattled.  
I owe you one, Cheng.&quot;

She pauses, then corrects herself:

&gt; &quot;Eatone.&quot;

You offer a nod.

&gt; &quot;You sure you're good to keep going, ma'am?&quot;

She wipes some blood from her eyebrow and squares her shoulders.

&gt; &quot;If I wasn't, I wouldn't be here.&quot;

She looks down at the unconscious agent.

&gt; &quot;But now we know for sure: this corridor's compromised. Baroque Works is *inside* Rain Dinners' internal systems.  
They're not just watching-they're *moving things.*&quot;

---

**ð Updates:**

- **Vent locked. No more surprise drops.**  
- **Baroque Agent KO'd** - Can be interrogated later.  
- **Tashigi remains active, but injured** - trusts you, defers tactically.  
- **Inventory Updated** - Baroque Dagger acquired.  
- **Status: Clean sweep. You are now a fully embedded ally in this Marine op.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Move forward with Tashigi. Push deeper into Rain Dinners' inner workings.}
2. {Ask what she knows about Baroque Works. You've earned some answers.}
3. {Interrogate the downed agent briefly before continuing. Fast questions, quick gain.}
4. {Use your juice to reinforce this position. Turn it into a fallback point if things go south.}
5. {Contact Enzo. Tell him exactly what's happening-and ask if this dagger matches anything known.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - That Smoker guy, he's your CO, right? You able to get in contact with him? Whatever's going on here, seems out of my pay grade. Maybe out of both our pay grades.

OOC: Smoker has likely been captured in the trap already

OOC: I have a positive disposition to the Marines

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Smoker, right? Might be time to phone the boss.&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Professional Concern | Disposition: Respectful Ally of the Law**  
**ð² Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Professional Instinct, +1 Marine Familiarity) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Reaction - (+2 Respect for Transparency, -1 Worry Over Smoker's Status) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You voice the right concern at the right time-Tashigi is honest with you. She tries to reach Smoker... but something's wrong.**

---

You nudge the unconscious agent with your boot-just a tap, to make sure he's not faking a nap-then glance toward the deeper shadows of the corridor.

&gt; &quot;That Smoker guy,&quot; you say quietly, turning to Tashigi,  
&gt; &quot;he's your CO, right?&quot;

She nods, standing straighter at the mention of his name, as if reflexively steeling herself.

&gt; &quot;You able to get in contact with him?  
Because... whatever's going on here-it's *above my grade*. Might be above *both* of ours.&quot;

She exhales slowly, wiping more blood off her cheek with the cuff of her coat.

&gt; &quot;Yeah. It is.&quot;

She pulls a **small Den Den Mushi** from her inside jacket pocket-a different one than before. **Direct line.** You catch a faint glimpse of a scratched &quot;S&quot; engraved in the casing.

She taps it awake.

&gt; **&quot;Captain Smoker, this is Tashigi. Situation update: hostile Baroque Works agents active in casino interior. Requesting sitrep-Captain, come in.&quot;**

Silence.

She tries again.

&gt; &quot;Captain?  
Smoker, this is Tashigi. I'm with a freelance ally. We've got a downed agent, compromised corridors, and a high likelihood of organized infiltration. Respond.&quot;

Still nothing.

The Den Den Mushi blinks... then frowns.  
Eyes closed.

&gt; &quot;That's not signal loss,&quot; she mutters, lowering it slightly.  
&gt; &quot;That's... severed connection. He's *offline.*&quot;

You frown.

&gt; &quot;Could mean a lot of things.&quot;

She nods grimly.

&gt; &quot;But when it comes to Smoker?  
*It never means something good.*&quot;

---

**OOC Context Crosscheck:**  
Smoker, at this point in canon, **has just been captured** along with the Straw Hats in **Crocodile's trap beneath Rain Dinners**.  
He is inside the **Seastone cage** suspended above the Banana Gator pit.  
He's **off-grid.**

---

**ð Updates:**

- Smoker **cannot be contacted**. Likely captured.  
- Tashigi is now aware her superior is missing. She will begin shifting into **autonomous Marine op mode**.  
- You are now functioning as her **partner in field assessment**-even without official rank.

---

She lowers the Den Den Mushi, face hardening.

&gt; &quot;That's it then. We're on our own.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;We keep moving. Find out how deep this hole goes-and figure out if your lady in blue is still ahead of us... or already fallen in.&quot;

She starts walking again, slower now, hand near her sword.

&gt; &quot;You still with me, teacher?&quot;

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {&quot;Yeah. Let's move.&quot; Continue with Tashigi deeper into the lower Rain Dinners complex.}
2. {&quot;Wait. Let's interrogate this guy while we've got the chance.&quot; Try to get info while Tashigi still watches your back.}
3. {&quot;You go ahead. Let me watch our rear and cover this point.&quot; Prepare the fallback trap.}
4. {&quot;If we're doing this, we're doing this smart.&quot; Draw a quick map with your juice. Navigate tactically.}
5. {&quot;We should get her out too.&quot; Start talking plans to find Vivi. That's what started this, after all.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - You sure, ma'am? I've seen the newspapers, your CO's a beast. Whatever can take him down can probably turn me into pulp. Should we fall back and call for help? 

I gesture at her injuries with genuine concern

OOC: Out of concern for Smoker and her own pride/bravery, she might insist on continuing deeper.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Are you sure? Because if *he's* down...&quot;**  
**ð&shy; Tone: Earnest Concern, Calculated Caution | Focus: Protect the brave, not coddle them**  
**ð² Emotional Intelligence Roll - (Eatone +2 Empathy, +1 Tactical Thinking) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Pride vs. Wisdom Roll - (+2 Duty, -1 Injury, -1 Trust in You) = Result: 2 [Average]**  
**â Outcome: Tashigi hears you-really hears you. She resists at first... but the weight of reality lands. She doesn't retreat, but she adapts.**

---

You fall into step beside her, close enough to speak low, your voice calm but firm.

&gt; &quot;You sure, ma'am?&quot;

She halts, just slightly-barely a break in step-but enough.

&gt; &quot;I've read the newspapers. I've seen what your CO can do.  
The man's a beast. I've seen entire pirate crews surrender just because he *lit two cigars at once*.&quot;

You give her a look-not doubt, but genuine worry.

&gt; &quot;If *that* guy's been taken out by whatever's in here...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Then whoever did it could probably fold me into a lunchbox.&quot;

Your tone softens. You raise a hand, gesturing toward the blood on her temple.

&gt; &quot;And you're already hurt.&quot;

She breathes in sharply through her nose. You see it-the flinch. Not from pain, but from pride. From the *truth.*

&gt; &quot;I've had worse.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Not questioning your strength. I'm saying we might need to think bigger.  
Fall back. Regroup. Call in reinforcements. Marines. Hunters. Hell, a Weather Priest from Skypeia if we can get one on short notice.&quot;

That gets a faint snort-half a chuckle, half a sigh.

&gt; &quot;Smoker would never retreat,&quot; she says.  
Then, quieter:  
&gt; &quot;...But he would *think.*&quot;

She steps back toward the wall, leans slightly, touching her head again.

&gt; &quot;I won't run, Cheng. But you're right. Charging in blind is a good way to make this a recovery mission instead of a rescue.&quot;

She pulls out a small, black-bound notebook from her inner coat and flips to a sketched floor plan.

&gt; &quot;This is what I have on Rain Dinners' internal layout. Incomplete.  
If we're going in, we're going **around**-not through. Take a service tunnel to flank the lower levels where the cage system is kept.&quot;

She draws a line with a pencil.  
**A longer path. Safer. Smarter.**

She glances at you.

&gt; &quot;Will you take point?&quot;

---

**ð Tactical Update:**

- Tashigi acknowledges the danger. She will not fall back fully, but will take the **longer, stealthier route**.
- You've preserved her pride while shifting the operation to a safer plan.
- You are now leading the approach. She defers to your instincts until reinforcements arrive (or don't).

---

**Next Decision:**

1. {Accept point. Guide her through the flank route. Prep juice traps and markers as you go.}
2. {Suggest splitting up. One of you draws fire, the other circles. Risky, but could gain advantage.}
3. {Insist on treating her injuries with first aid before moving. You've got a little medical training.}
4. {Map your own juice-route in parallel. If all else fails, you can carve an exit with it.}
5. {Ask her more about Rain Dinners' internal cage system. You need to know *exactly* what you're walking into.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - Consider me part of your posse, ma'am.

I rip a piece of exquisite cloth off the downed assassin. Before we go, mind if I take a look at those wounds? Don't want you getting an infection later (in a teacher's tone of voice)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Consider me part of your posse, ma'am.&quot;**  
**Action: First Aid via Improvised Materials | Tone: Responsible Adult Energy**

**â Outcome: She grumbles, but lets you tend her wounds. You stabilize her condition and earn deeper trust.**

---

You tuck your baton away, kneel beside the downed assassin, and without hesitation, rip a **clean swatch of silk** from the hem of his overdesigned Baroque Works jacket. It's absurdly luxurious-threaded with gold, probably worth more than your **entire monthly salary** back home.

You twirl it once to test the fibers, then fold it into a **makeshift compress**, your expression all business.

&gt; &quot;Consider me part of your posse, ma'am,&quot; you say, standing again.  
&gt; &quot;But before we play heroes in some underground death-maze-mind if I take a look at those wounds?&quot;

She opens her mouth-probably to object-so you *cut her off with tone alone.*

&gt; &quot;Because if that cut festers and you keel over from a fever in three days,  
*I* am not doing the paperwork.&quot;

She raises an eyebrow. Then sighs like a woman who's been assigned *extra homework she can't argue with.*

&gt; &quot;...Fine. Just don't make a big thing out of it.&quot;

You step in gently, motioning for her to tilt her head.

**The damage:**

- A clean cut along her right brow, bleeding slowed.  
- Minor concussion signs-likely from the impact during her earlier fight.  
- Nothing life-threatening, but **infection risk is real** in an environment like this.

You dab the wound with a **kiwi-acid-diluted cloth tip**-*low concentration*, just enough to cleanse without burning. She winces, but doesn't flinch.

&gt; &quot;You're better at this than half the field medics I know,&quot; she mutters.

&gt; &quot;I grade science fair disasters for a living,&quot; you reply. &quot;This is nothing.&quot;

You tie the silk into a tight head wrap, neat and snug. It looks ridiculous. Also kind of badass.

&gt; &quot;There. You're stabilized. Not dying. No excuse to stop moving.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Understood, Nurse Cheng,&quot; she deadpans-but you catch the smallest smile at the corner of her mouth.

---

**ð Status Update:**

- Tashigi is now **treated for infection** and stabilized.  
- Her concussion symptoms have been **partially addressed**-enough to stay alert.  
- Your standing with her has deepened. She sees you not just as backup-but as *reliable.*

---

**Inventory Note:**
- **-1 square meter of Baroque Luxury Silk** (Used)  
- **+1 Kiwi-Acid Cleanser, Improvised (Field Use)**

---

She nods toward the deeper tunnel.

&gt; &quot;Alright. Let's go save your blue-haired mystery girl, and maybe catch a Warlord committing treason while we're at it.&quot;

---

**Next Move:**

1. {Lead the way into the flanking tunnel, juice-sensing ahead for traps or movement.}
2. {Mark a fallback zone with juice on the floor behind you-just in case the whole tunnel caves in.}
3. {Suggest leaving a trail Tashigi can follow if you need to split temporarily. Prep for split maneuver.}
4. {Ask her what intel she has on the trap mechanism Crocodile's supposed to use. Details could save lives.}
5. {Sneak ahead solo for 30 meters-give her time to fully recover while you scout.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Rational cowardice

âI choke on my spit.

Wait, whoa whoa whoa. WHOA.

Warlord? I thought this was just some low level organized crime? What warlord?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;WHOA. Back up. *Warlord?*&quot;**

**â Outcome: Tashigi is slightly amused and entirely honest. She gives you the full picture-*finally.***

---

You're halfway through adjusting the compression bandage when **her words hit you.**

&gt; &quot;...maybe catch a Warlord committing treason...&quot;

You freeze.

Then-

&gt; *Cough-coughCOUGH-SPIT*  
&gt; &quot;Wait-**WHOA WHOA WHOA-WHAT?!**&quot;

You stagger back half a step, hand instinctively covering your chest like the **word &quot;Warlord&quot;** just punched you in the ribs.

&gt; &quot;*Warlord?!*  
I thought this was-what, **organized crime?** Black market arms? Casino laundering? Maybe *light child-snatching*?  
But *Warlord*?! What warlord?!&quot;

Tashigi just stares at you.  
There's a beat of silence.

&gt; &quot;...You really didn't know.&quot;

&gt; &quot;NO, I DIDN'T KNOW! I came here for a **discount vacation**, not to get blasted by a guy with **government immunity and a sand motif!**&quot;

She sighs. A long one. Then leans against the wall again.

&gt; &quot;Alright. You've earned it.&quot;

She looks at you-fully now. No Marine veneer.

&gt; &quot;**Sir Crocodile.**  
You know him from the newspapers. Hero of Alabasta. Pirate turned protector.  
Also-**Warlord of the Sea.** One of the Seven. Works âfor' the World Government, but mostly does his own thing.&quot;

She pauses.

&gt; &quot;And he's the one running **Baroque Works.** Has been for years. Rain Dinners? This whole operation? It's a front.&quot;

&gt; &quot;A front... for *what?!*&quot;

&gt; &quot;A coup.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;He's trying to topple the Alabasta monarchy and take control. That woman in blue you saw?  
If I'm right, that's **Princess Vivi.**&quot;

You feel something between nausea and adrenaline start bubbling in your gut.

&gt; &quot;Oh good. Good.  
Warlord-helmed conspiracies, royal fugitives, secret death basements, and I've got a **fruit that makes juice.**&quot;

Tashigi cracks a smile.

&gt; &quot;You're handling it better than most.&quot;

---

**ð Major Lore Drop Gained:**

- **Sir Crocodile = Warlord of the Sea**
- **Baroque Works is his personal underground empire**
- The **woman in blue** is almost certainly **Princess Nefertari Vivi**
- Crocodile is attempting a **coup d'Ã©tat in Alabasta**, using Rain Dinners as a key control point

You are now aware of **the real stakes**.

---

**Next Steps (while your rational brain catches up):**

1. {&quot;Okay. I'm in. But I'm gonna complain the whole way.&quot; Continue down the tunnel with Tashigi, sarcastically.}
2. {&quot;I need a plan.&quot; Stop and sketch a new plan with your juice. Something *smart*, now that you know the scale.}
3. {&quot;This is above us. I'm calling Enzo anyway.&quot; Try again for outside reinforcements while Tashigi watches your back.}
4. {&quot;Let's go find that princess.&quot; Focus the mission-get Vivi. She's the linchpin now.}
5. {&quot;I want hazard pay.&quot; Mutter while you sneak ahead. Scout the flank path like you're not internally screaming.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: I... Shit... Egghh...

OOC: Tashigi notices my willingness to follow her wavering.

OOC: I left my den den mushi in my room, like a dumbass.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Emotional Reaction Chosen - &quot;I... Shit... Egghh...&quot;**

**ð² Tashigi's Response to Faltering Ally - (+2 Empathy, +1 Leadership Instinct, -1 Urgency) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: Tashigi sees your nerves hit critical, but instead of pushing you, she steps in-*like a true officer*. She gives you something to hold on to.**

---

&gt; &quot;I... Shit... *Eggghh...*&quot;

You lean a hand against the tunnel wall, the weight of what you just learned settling on your spine like a sack of test papers you forgot to grade and now they're *sentient*. Your knees don't buckle-but your will to keep walking *definitely does*.

Tashigi notices instantly.

Her steps slow. She doesn't draw her sword. Doesn't bark orders.  
She just... waits. Watches you. Then approaches-firm, but not forceful.

&gt; &quot;Hey.&quot;

She speaks like you're one of her cadets. Not beneath her. Not disposable.

&gt; &quot;You don't have to be a hero.  
You didn't sign up for this. Hell, I didn't sign up for this either.&quot;

You mutter something about forgetting your Den Den Mushi. Like a dumbass.  
She gives a crooked smile.

&gt; &quot;It happens. You'd be surprised how many Marines forget theirs during *training exercises,* never mind while chasing Warlords through casino basements.&quot;

Then, softer:

&gt; &quot;But you came this far. You saved my life. You called me âma'am' like you meant it.  
That tells me everything I need to know.&quot;

She reaches into her coat. Pulls out a small rectangular badge-not a Marine insignia, but something smaller, older.

A **teacher's pin.**

&gt; &quot;Before the Marines, I worked a year in a community school on Shell Island.  
Thirty kids. Only two books. One chalk stick between them.  
I still think about them.&quot;

She holds it for a second longer... then tucks it away.

&gt; &quot;You came here to relax. And instead, you found out the world's uglier than you thought.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;But so did I. So does everyone-sooner or later.&quot;

She steps forward. Offers her hand.

&gt; &quot;You don't have to come any further if you don't want to. But if you do...  
I'd be proud to have you at my side.&quot;

---

**ð Emotional Impact:**

- Tashigi sees you not as a tool, but as an **equal with limits.**  
- Your bond has deepened-**respect born of vulnerability and shared weight.**  
- You are no longer just *freelance help*. She sees you as *comrade.*  
- No pressure. You can still say **no** and retreat.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Take her hand. &quot;Let's go before I change my mind.&quot; Continue on, shaken but loyal.}
2. {Take a minute. Sit, breathe, steady yourself, *then* go forward. No shame in needing 60 seconds.}
3. {Nod. &quot;I'll follow... just not up front anymore.&quot; Support role only.}
4. {Decide to stay and guard the fallback point. Not cowardice-*contingency planning.*}
5. {Ask her one favor: &quot;If I die, make sure the kids back home know I didn't just disappear.&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - whew, give me a second to process my mortality.

I slap my face a few times, a few droplets of juice flung out by my still wet off-hand.

Alright. I suppose I couldn't let a nice lady like you get murdered by yourself. Not when I could've made a difference. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;Give me a second to wrestle with the crushing awareness of my own fragile mortality.&quot;**  
**Tone: Self-deprecating Bravery | Action: Regaining Resolve With Grit and Juice-Flecked Dignity**  
**ð² Emotional Recovery Roll - (Eatone +2 Emotional Honesty, +1 Core Integrity, +1 Juice-Slapping Ritual) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You regain composure, reaffirm your moral compass, and Tashigi sees it for what it is-*real courage.***

---

You raise a finger like you're about to pause class before a pop quiz.

&gt; &quot;*Whew.*&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Just-just give me a second here to process my impending doom.&quot;

You drop to a seated crouch for a breath. Not slumped. Just... grounded.

You give yourself a firm slap on the cheeks-**not dramatic**, just enough to **jolt the cowardice off like dust from a coat**.

&gt; *SPLAT.*  
A few **juice droplets fling off your left hand**, smacking the wall with soft *plips*, forming temporary little green comet-tails before fading.

You sigh.

Then rise.

&gt; &quot;Alright.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;I suppose I couldn't let a nice lady like you get murdered by yourself.  
Not when I could've made a difference.&quot;

Tashigi looks at you, blinking once-then nods slowly.

&gt; &quot;You're alright, Eatone.&quot;

Her hand doesn't move to her sword. It rests instead near her **Marine pin**, brushing it once like a grounding stone.

&gt; &quot;Let's go do something stupid and noble.&quot;

---

**ð Status Update:**

- Eatone's **resolve has been reaffirmed**. Shaken but stable.  
- Tashigi views you as **equal in bravery**, not bravado.  
- You've earned a reputation-**not as a fighter, but as someone who *chooses to stand when it counts*.**  
- You are mentally and emotionally fit to continue the mission.

---

The tunnel stretches before you now-dim, uncertain, alive with whispered danger.

But not unwatched.  
Not unguarded.  
And **not alone**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Take point again. Back to work. Carefully guide Tashigi along the flanking path toward Rain Dinners' lower complex.}
2. {Ask one last quiet question-&quot;You ever been this far off-script before?&quot; Just to know you're not the only one.}
3. {Leave a juice message along the wall-*&quot;We went this way&quot;*-in case others come looking for you.}
4. {Draw a map in juice and hang it near the tunnel entrance. If this becomes a grave, at least it'll be *a marked one*.}
5. {&quot;Let's find that princess. And hope she's not dead yet.&quot; Move with purpose. It's all about Vivi now.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Youu're hurt. I'll take point, watch my six.

Also tell me if I'm going the wrong way, you're the one with the map.

Draw my baton and prepare another orb of juice

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;You're hurt. I'll take point.&quot;**  
**Tone: Steady Resolve | Formation: Frontline Guardian + Injured Officer Backup**

**ð² Tashigi's Trust Roll - (+2 Respect, +1 Tactical Logic, -1 Stubborn Injury) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You assume the lead with Tashigi's full backing. The duo is now officially a coordinated unit. You are the tip of the spear.**

---

&gt; &quot;You're hurt. I'll take point.&quot;

Your tone is calm, even-but final. You draw your **Seastone-tipped baton** in a smooth, practiced arc, holding it low and backhanded-**non-lethal but absolute**. With your off-hand, you form another **tight juice orb**, compressed and tuned to **burst or bind** on contact.

Tashigi blinks, then exhales. There's no protest this time. Just a subtle nod as she moves into your **six o'clock position**, sword drawn but held one-handed-*ready*, but not *rushing*.

&gt; &quot;You've got the nose, I've got the layout.  
You walk, I talk. I'll correct you if you're about to charge into an active gator filtration pipe.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...How active are we talking?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Flesh-dissolving foam active.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Copy that.&quot;

---

**You step forward.**

The corridor shifts from finished wall to **raw concrete and iron**-**Rain Dinners' bones**, not the painted skin of the guest floors. The lights dim further. **Your juice orb pulses softly**, casting an eerie green halo on the damp walls.

The silence is thicker here. No footsteps but your own. No voices.  
Just the **distant hum of a subterranean system**-like a crocodile snoring behind metal.

---

**Terrain Details:**

- The path branches **twice**. One toward an **elevator shaft**, sealed. The other-a **maintenance ladder** leading down.  
- Tashigi calls it:  
&gt; &quot;Down. Leads toward the sub-basement air tunnels. We can reach the chamber edge without alerting the main guards.&quot;

You start to descend.

&gt; *Step. Step. Juice-drip. Breath.*

Somewhere ahead: the **cage**.  
Somewhere inside: **Smoker. The Straw Hats. Vivi.**  
And if you wait too long... **Crocodile himself.**

---

**ð Current Status:**

- **Eatone**: Frontline position | Baton drawn | Juice orb ready  
- **Tashigi**: Following close, sword half-drawn, navigating from map memory  
- **Party Stealth: Moderate** - No detection yet, but environment is narrowing  
- **Mission Objective:** Reach the *cage chamber* unseen. Intercept. Rescue. Survive.

---

**What would you like to do next at the ladder base?**

1. {Send a thin juice tendril into the vent ahead. Scout for heat, movement, or sound.}
2. {Ask Tashigi if she has a code phrase to give to Smoker if he's conscious when you find him.}
3. {Set a juice trap behind you on the ladder. If you're followed, they'll regret it.}
4. {Peek around the next corner silently. Check for guards or cameras.}
5. {Request that Tashigi draw her blade fully. You're close enough to danger it's no longer optional.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 / 5 - Slowly slice the cake around the corner. Motion for Tashigi to ready her blade.

Y'know, your CO runs with a Seastone weapon, right? And also has a devil fruit that makes him produce substance.

I hold up my baton with a dripping hand. Aren't I, like a Beri-store version of him? I joke, hoping to lighten the mood

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 4/5 Hybrid Selected - &quot;Cake Slice + Tactical Banter&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Edge + Gallows Humor | Formation: Precision Stealth Entry with Lightened Hearts**

**ð² Tashigi's Combat Readiness - (+2 Trained, +1 Banter Response) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You move like a pro. The joke lands. The bond strengthens. No enemies in immediate sight-*yet*.**

---

You hold up one finger.  
**Silent motion: &quot;Wait.&quot;**

Then, carefully, **slice the corner** like it's the last piece of Blackbeard's birthday cake and you're making damn sure no one sees you sneak it.

&gt; *One foot forward.  
Baton drawn.  
Juice hand steady.  
No sudden movements.*

As you round the corner, your eyes sweep fast:

- **Steel corridor**, slightly wider now.  
- **Two wall-mounted Den Den cameras**-but *rotating slowly*, with a 4-second blind spot.  
- A **fork** in the path ahead. One route marked *Waste Purge Access*. The other... no signage at all. Just cold air drifting out and the faint sound of **dripping chains.**

Your breath catches. That sound?  
It's **below.**  
Could be the **cage chamber**.

You step back from the edge and motion for Tashigi to draw fully.

She obeys without a word, blade sliding from the scabbard with a clean metallic whisper.

Then-trying to shake the tension just a little-you half-turn and nod to your baton and the sticky droplets still running down your off-hand.

&gt; &quot;Y'know, your CO runs with a Seastone weapon, right?  
Also has a Devil Fruit that lets him produce a substance.&quot;

You hold up your baton.

Then your hand.

Then do a weak little jazz-hands shake with both.

&gt; &quot;Aren't I like... a **Beri-store version** of him?&quot;

There's a beat.  
Then a snort from Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;Heh. Only difference is Smoker doesn't have a kill count involving *juice-based concussions.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yet.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Right. I'll tell him you're his budget twin when we get him out of that cage.&quot;

She steps up beside you now-**shoulder to shoulder**. Ready.

---

**ð Tactical Readout:**

- **Corner cleared**: No enemy patrol in immediate sight  
- **Cameras visible**: Identified rotation timing. Avoidable.  
- **Potential Cage Access Located**: The unmarked path with chain drip sounds likely leads to the Straw Hats  
- **Morale: Steady** - Banter = sanity under pressure

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Time the camera and slip down the unmarked hallway. Head toward the cage quietly.}
2. {Use your juice to blind one of the cameras. Keep your rear safe.}
3. {Ask Tashigi what you'll do *if* the cage is down there-and it's already filling with water.}
4. {Prep a juice-based adhesive trap near the fork-backtrack security.}
5. {Split. One of you hits the purge corridor, the other scouts the cage route. Fast but risky.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Make silent, tactical hand motions at the cameras and their rotation timing. (Ready to move when you are)

OOC: Tashigi may know about cages, but I don't.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Silent ops. Slide under the cameras. Head for the cage.&quot;**  
**Tone: Tactician-in-Training | Action: Coordinated Movement with Nonverbal Team Signals**  
**ð² Stealth Maneuver Roll - (Eatone +2 Timing, +1 Juice Sense Precision, +1 Tactical Focus) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Tashigi Coordination Roll - (+2 Marine Training, +1 Trust in You) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You both move flawlessly. Undetected. One step closer to the heart of Crocodile's trap.**

---

You make a sharp series of **tactical hand signals**, pointing first to the **left camera**, then to the **right**, followed by a flat-palm circular motion:  
**&quot;Rotating, four-second blind spot.&quot;**  
Then two fingers to your eyes, then down the unmarked hallway:  
**&quot;Eyes forward. Target this way.&quot;**

Tashigi nods once, blade low, body coiled like a spring.  
No words.  
Just a slight flex of her shoulder and a silent **&quot;ready.&quot;**

---

&gt; **You move.**

As soon as the camera eyes shift away, you slip past the intersection-fluid and silent, your shoes barely making a sound. Tashigi mirrors you flawlessly, following your exact line of motion with ghostlike precision.

**No alerts.  
No alarm snails.  
No yelling from Baroque goons.**

Only the soft, echoing sound of **dripping chains** as you approach the end of the corridor.

---

**You come to a halt at a grated walkway**, where a **large drop** opens below you-maybe 15 meters down.

Peering carefully over the edge, you see:

- A **massive stone chamber**, artificially excavated and reinforced with iron.  
- In the center, suspended by **titanium-alloy cables**, hangs a **huge cage** made of **Sea-Prism Stone bars**.  
- Inside: five people.  
  - A **boy in a straw hat**, slumped but breathing.  
  - A green-haired man.  
  - A small reindeer in a hat.  
  - A blonde girl in business attire.  
  - And-**Vivi. Blue hair. Very much real.**

Below the cage: **murky water**, churning faintly.

You see **Banana Gators** circling below. At least three. Maybe more.

&gt; *And there's no one else visible. No guards. No Crocodile. No Robin.*

Tashigi leans next to you and whispers:

&gt; &quot;That's the Seastone cage. They're inside.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;If it drops... that's it.&quot;

You still don't know what Seastone really means, but **your instincts are firing like a fire alarm in the chemistry lab.**

---

**ð Situation Update:**

- You've reached the edge of Crocodile's trap chamber.  
- You have **visual** on Vivi and the Straw Hats-**alive**, but confined.  
- **No enemies in sight... yet.**  
- The cage is suspended above Banana Gators. One mistake, and it's over.  
- You are in stealth. No one knows you're here.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Whisper to Tashigi: &quot;What's Seastone? Can we break that cage?&quot; Learn first, act second.}  
2. {Start forming juice tendrils down the wall-create a silent descent path. Maybe you can reach them.}  
3. {Wait. Observe. Crocodile could be coming soon. Let him monologue and give you intel.}  
4. {Send a juice signal to the cage. Just a splash. Alert Vivi someone's coming-but subtly.}  
5. {Pull back. You've got their position. Time to find a way to disable the trap from afar.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I turn to Tashigi and whisper - what... What the hell is going on? Who's blue over there? Who's the kids? Why are they kids? Is there a kid diddler around here? Where's smoker?

I babble, a stream of consciousness as the scene overwhelms me in confusion.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;...What the hell is going on?&quot;**  
**Tone: Overwhelmed Civilian With Front-Row Seats to the Boss Fight**  
**ð² Mental Overload Roll - (Eatone +2 Confusion, +1 Emotional Honesty, -1 Gator-Induced Adrenal Fatigue) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Response - (+2 Mission Focus, +1 Soft Spot for Chaos Under Pressure) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You babble. Tashigi keeps you anchored. And finally gives you the full download, no filters.**

---

Your eyes lock on the surreal nightmare below.  
A spinning soup of facts, faces, and **Banana Gator teeth** start to fold in on themselves in your brain.

You lean close to Tashigi, **still whispering**, but with the breathless desperation of a man trying to keep his last few **functional brain cells** from leaping off the balcony.

&gt; &quot;What... what the hell is going on? Who's blue over there? That *has* to be the girl I saw.  
And who the hell are those kids? *Why are they kids?!*  
Is there a **kid diddler** in this situation? Because that's **my jurisdiction.** I swear if this whole coup has a predator angle-&quot;

Your voice goes up a little. You catch yourself.  
The juice orb in your hand shudders with the tension.

&gt; &quot;And where is your *captain*? Isn't he supposed to be in here punching the Warlord in the throat?!&quot;

Tashigi stares at you.

Then places a single hand gently on your shoulder.

&gt; &quot;Eatone.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yeah?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Breathe.&quot;

You do.  
Barely.

Then she begins, voice just above a whisper-but *perfectly controlled*.

---

&gt; &quot;The girl in blue is **Princess Vivi Nefertari**. Of Alabasta.  
She infiltrated Baroque Works months ago to learn who was behind the rebellion tearing her kingdom apart.&quot;

&gt; &quot;That sounds... like an insane extracurricular.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The ones in the cage? Those are the **Straw Hat Pirates.**&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;They're pirates?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yes. But not the bad kind.&quot;

She sighs.

&gt; &quot;The one with the straw hat is **Monkey D. Luffy.** The World Government has no idea what to do with him.  
He's the kind of person who punches a Celestial Dragon *and then makes friends with the guy he just punched.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's not a real sentence.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They followed Vivi here. They're trying to help her stop the coup.&quot;

She lowers her voice even further.

&gt; &quot;And if they're in the cage-**so is Smoker.** He was tailing them.  
Crocodile must've caught them all at once. He was waiting for them.&quot;

You glance down again.

The girl in the suit (Nami) is pacing.  
The swordsman (Zoro) looks pissed.  
The kid in the hat is slumped... but not unconscious.

And Vivi... Vivi is gripping the bars like a woman praying the bars are fake.

---

**ð You now know:**

- The Straw Hats are not random kids. They are **infamous pirates**, but known to oppose evil.
- Princess Vivi is **actively trying to stop the civil war.**
- Smoker is likely in the cage, out of view.
- This is **Crocodile's big move**-you are here *just* before the moment where canon breaks wide open.

Tashigi glances at you.

&gt; &quot;Still with me?&quot;

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {&quot;...Alright. Let's get them out.&quot; Begin forming a plan to reach the cage or stop the trap.}
2. {Stay quiet. Watch. Crocodile might appear at any second-this could be *the moment*.}
3. {Use juice to signal Vivi. Let her know someone *good* is nearby.}
4. {Whisper: &quot;Okay. So what's *your* plan?&quot; Let Tashigi lead this phase.}
5. {&quot;So hypothetically, what would *not* set off an alarm?&quot; Try to access the trap controls.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - If smoker's down there somewhere, whoever caught smoker could be down there too. Let's not be too reckless here.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;If Smoker's in the cage... whoever caged him is still nearby.&quot;**  
**Tone: Rational Caution | Status: Recon-Over-Rescue Instinct**  
**ð² Tactical Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Danger Awareness, +1 Respect for Chain of Command) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Reaction - (+2 Professional Alignment, +1 Shared Worry, -1 Urge to Act Fast) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You hold position. Tashigi agrees. You're now both in full recon mode, awaiting the arrival of the true threat.**

---

You stare down at the cage suspended in that cavernous room like a **hook baited with people**-and your gut coils into a dense little fist of alarm.

&gt; &quot;If Smoker's down there somewhere...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Then *whoever* was strong enough to take him out is still nearby.&quot;

You don't raise your voice. You don't flinch.  
But your hand tightens ever so slightly on your baton.

&gt; &quot;Let's not be reckless. Not yet.&quot;

Tashigi narrows her eyes, lips tightening in grim approval. She nods.

&gt; &quot;Agreed. We can't win a fight we don't understand.&quot;

She crouches lower, motioning you back just slightly from the ledge. Together, you settle into the **railing's shadow**, backs to the wall, **eyes on the drop**.

Your juice orb pulses quietly in your palm, calm and alert, like a watchdog made of pulp and purpose.

---

Then... you hear it.

**The air changes.**

A door far below **hisses open**-somewhere behind the cage chamber.  
A voice follows. **Calm. Cool. Dangerous.**

&gt; &quot;I warned you, Princess.  
Alabasta will be saved-*with or without you.*&quot;

You know that voice. You saw the headlines.  
**Sir Crocodile.**  
Warlord. Coup leader. Absolute bastard with a hook for a hand and no patience for resistance.

You and Tashigi lock eyes.

&gt; *It's go time. But not strike time. Not yet.*

---

**ð Update:**

- Crocodile has arrived. He is now monologuing in the chamber below.  
- You and Tashigi are in *perfect stealth position* for recon or a surgical strike if needed.  
- The Straw Hats remain caged. Vivi visibly flinched at Crocodile's voice.  
- Tashigi is *laser-focused*. Not moving. Waiting for a window.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Observe in silence. Let Crocodile reveal more. Every villain monologue is intel gold.}
2. {Whisper a juice-thread down toward the cage. Try to tap the bars to alert them *without alerting Crocodile.*}
3. {Ask Tashigi: &quot;If he drops that cage... is there anything we can do?&quot; Just in case.}
4. {Begin forming a juice construct across the ceiling-*if you need to drop in fast*, you'll have a path.}
5. {Pull back slightly. Prep for ranged support. You're a striker, not a savior. Know your role.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - My eyes widen at the sight of crocodile - guess he really is behind all this.  I gently pat Tashigi's sword arm and shake my head. There is no way I'm fighting a warlord. And there's no way I'm letting you throw yourself at him.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Observe. Confirm. *Do Not Engage.*&quot;**  
**Tone: Controlled Fear + Protective Instinct | Decision: Recon over Heroics**  
**ð² Willpower vs. Intimidation Roll - (Eatone +2 Discipline, +1 Moral Focus, -1 Crocodile Terror Aura) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Instinct to Act Roll - (+2 Duty, +1 Wound Fatigue, -2 You Stopping Her) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: You hold your ground-emotionally and physically. Tashigi pauses. You both stay hidden... and what you see may change everything.**

---

Your **eyes go wide** as **Crocodile** steps into view below.  
There's no mistaking him:

- Broad-shouldered, tan skin, gold hook glinting in the underground light.  
- Fur-collared coat, Warlord swagger, cigar already lit like the *credits are about to roll*.  
- His presence hits like **a vice on your chest**-the weight of a man who's destroyed kingdoms and smiled through it.

Your first instinct?  
**Nope.**

You gently reach out and pat Tashigi's arm-right near the **guard of her blade**, fingers firm but calm. Then shake your head, ever so slightly.

&gt; &quot;There is *no way* I'm fighting a Warlord.&quot;

You nod toward her blade.

&gt; &quot;And there's no way I'm letting *you* throw yourself at him. Not like this.&quot;

She grits her teeth-but doesn't move.

You see the fire in her eyes, the clenched jaw. But also the way her **knees wobble for just a second**.  
She exhales.  
And stays put.

&gt; &quot;...You're right,&quot; she whispers. &quot;He'd kill us both.&quot;

---

Below, **Crocodile paces** in front of the cage, hands behind his back like a man delivering a guest lecture at *Murder College.*

&gt; &quot;You know, I admired your loyalty, Princess. Truly.  
But this kingdom? These people? They've been broken for years.  
What I'm doing... is mercy.&quot;

Vivi shouts something in response. You can't make out the words, but her voice **cracks with fury.**

Crocodile raises his hook.

&gt; &quot;You'll all serve a purpose. One final message to the rebels above.&quot;

He turns to a **large lever** at the back wall.  
**Your heart skips a beat.**

Tashigi whispers:

&gt; &quot;That's the drop release. He's going to kill them.&quot;

---

**ð Situation Update:**

- Crocodile has begun **monologuing to the cage**-confirmed villain behavior.  
- The **release lever is in view.** If he pulls it, the cage will fall into the Banana Gator pit.  
- Tashigi is *restrained but tense*-ready to break cover if you give her the word.  
- You are both **still unseen.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Whisper: &quot;Do we have a shot at that lever?&quot; Try to disable it with juice.}
2. {Send a juice tendril down to Vivi or Nami. Let them know you're here-but subtle.}
3. {Start preparing a juice construct across the ceiling. You *might* be able to get above the cage fast.}
4. {Wait. Just a little longer. He may still gloat. The more he talks, the more you learn.}
5. {Look for other exits. If the cage falls... someone has to live to tell the story.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - That cage... Maybe it's not an immediate drop? He seems like the kind of fellow to let his victims have time to ponder their doom.

I grin weakly.

Watch Crocodile &quot;talk&quot; any remaining hope out of Vivi 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Maybe he wants them to *simmer* first.&quot;**  
**Tone: Grim Observation with a Weak Smile | Action: Recon Continued, Morbid Humor Engaged**  
**ð² Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Psychological Read, +1 Villain Trope Recognition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Emotional Control - (+1 Anger, +1 Duty, -1 Wounded) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: Your prediction is correct-Crocodile *isn't* dropping the cage yet. He's playing with them. Watching breaks your heart... but gives you precious time.**

---

You hold your position, fingers trembling just slightly on your baton.  
Then you mutter, voice dry:

&gt; &quot;That cage... it's not an instant drop, is it?  
He's the kind of guy who'd give his victims time to *ponder their doom.*&quot;

You flash a **weak grin**, more exhale than joke.  
Tashigi doesn't laugh-but her eyes flicker with grim understanding.

&gt; &quot;Yeah. He's a sadist, not a sniper.&quot;

Below, **Crocodile stands now with his back to the cage**, the massive lever still untouched.  
He paces slowly, hand brushing along a **railing** as he speaks. His voice is soft-but in this echoing cavern, it **booms**.

&gt; &quot;You thought friendship would save you.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;You thought a kingdom's pain could be mended by kindness.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;You even brought children into this. A little reindeer. A child doctor. A pirate with the brain of a sea sponge.&quot;

He turns and steps closer to the cage, raising his hook, **pointing directly at Vivi**.

&gt; &quot;*This is what your hope bought you, princess.*  
Not salvation. Not peace.  
A box. A pit. And teeth.&quot;

Vivi stares back through the bars, shaking-but not backing away.  
Her mouth moves. You can't hear the words-but **you recognize defiance**.

Crocodile chuckles.

&gt; &quot;No clever speech?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;No dramatic plea? I'd hoped for something more... poetic.&quot;

He takes a **cigar from his coat**, lights it with a tiny flash of sand-generated heat.

Then?

He **sits.**  
Right on the control platform.

&gt; &quot;We'll wait, then.  
Let your fear catch up.&quot;

---

**ð Situation Update:**

- Crocodile is **not pulling the lever yet.**  
- He is **psychologically tormenting** them-especially Vivi.  
- The Straw Hats seem groggy or incapacitated, likely from earlier fights.  
- **You now have time.** Not much, but **time.**

Tashigi glances at you, whispering:

&gt; &quot;That's our window.  
If we're doing something... we do it now.&quot;

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Start forming a juice thread down to Vivi. Subtle. Whisper your presence. Let her help.}  
2. {Create a juice noose or clamp near the lever-prepare to stop it if pulled.}  
3. {Form a juice walkway across the ceiling. One of you drops above the cage, the other covers.}  
4. {Split up. You flank left, she flanks right. Someone needs to get to the lever.}  
5. {Whisper to Tashigi: &quot;We disable him, *then* get the cage. He's the threat.&quot; Plan an ambush.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Maybe... Maybe I can use my fruit ability - Kiwi juice, if you haven't smelled it already, to try to make a tendril and jam the lever. No guarantees that its going to be thick enough to work, though.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;Kiwi Countermeasure, Lever Edition&quot;**  
**Tone: Nervous Ingenuity | Mood: A Man About To Gamble His Citrus On Structural Engineering**  
**ð² Juice Precision Roll - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Planning Under Pressure, -1 Thin Trajectory) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**ð² Crocodile Awareness Roll - (+2 Observation, -2 Arrogant Monologue Mode) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**â Outcome: You manage to snake a juice tendril through the shadows and wrap the base of the lever-*soft, but sticky enough* to buy time when it matters. Crocodile doesn't notice... yet.**

---

You lower your voice to a whisper, barely audible over the soft echoes of Crocodile's speech below.

&gt; &quot;Maybe... maybe I can use my fruit.  
Kiwi juice-if you haven't smelled it already.&quot;

Tashigi exhales faintly through her nose.

&gt; &quot;I thought that was you.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yeah. It's me.  
I can form a tendril. Not thick, but... maybe sticky enough to **jam the lever** if he pulls.  
No guarantees.&quot;

You kneel by the railing, shift your weight into your off-hand, and begin to focus.

---

Your palm pulses.

From your fingertips, a **fine green strand** snakes outward-thick as twine, slick as oil.  
It dips below the ledge, hugging the shadows, crawling along the **overhead beamwork** of the chamber.

You **guide it like a living thing**, steering each motion with micro-muscle control and instinct-juice flowing like **liquid intuition**.

Down.  
Left.  
Avoid the hanging chains.  
Avoid Crocodile's field of vision.

Your breath hitches as the tendril slips under the **lever's mechanism housing**, finally curling tight around the **release shaft** like a strand of seaweed gripping coral.

&gt; **Connected.**

Not strong enough to stop a full-force pull-but **it'll slow the release**, maybe jam it if Crocodile does it with one hand.  
And more importantly?  
It gives you a **physical anchor point**. You now have tactile feedback on the lever.

If he moves it?

&gt; **You'll feel it.**

---

**Crocodile remains oblivious.**  
Still puffing his cigar.  
Still pacing.  
Still talking about kings and fools and the weight of sand and destiny.

&gt; &quot;The people will cheer when I bring order to this rotting land.  
A hero. A savior. A name that lasts.&quot;

You and Tashigi remain crouched, invisible.  
The tendril glows faintly in your vision-*invisible to him*.

She leans in and whispers:

&gt; &quot;You just bought us our first piece of time.  
What's next?&quot;

---

**ð Update:**

- **Juice Tendril anchored to the lever** - sticky enough to delay, not stop.  
- You have **physical feedback** if Crocodile makes a move.  
- Crocodile is unaware of your presence.  
- Tashigi is waiting for your lead.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Send another juice thread to Vivi-time to let her know help is here. She might be able to signal.}  
2. {Start constructing a juice sling path to the cage-if you need to reach it fast, this is your prep.}  
3. {Prep to blind Crocodile with a flash of juice directly to his cigar-cut his vision first.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi to scout for a second entrance or sniper angle. You'll hold here.}  
5. {Wait. Keep observing. The trap is set. Let's see what he does next.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - Might as well try to juice up any other visible mechanisms. Observe Vivi

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Operation: Juice the Room&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Engineer | Action: Passive Juice Control + Observation**  
**ð² Juice Utility Roll - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Mastery, +1 Subtle Control, +1 Engineering Intuition) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Stealth Check - Crocodile Awareness (+2 Perception, -2 Monologue Tunnel Vision) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You expand your tendril network subtly-no detection, and a little more influence over the room. Meanwhile, Vivi's body language gives you critical emotional data.**

---

You remain crouched, controlling your breath. Eyes focused, brain spinning like a tired teacher in a class full of spitballs and poor life choices.

&gt; *Alright, Cheng. Time to juice the whole damn test.*

Your off-hand pulses again.

From the thread wrapped around the **lever**, you **split three more strands**-fine, trailing threads of kiwi juice, guided with microscopic precision. They stretch toward **visible mechanisms** on the platform:

- A **pulley brake** along the far right wall-*likely a failsafe*.  
- A **chain-lock wheel** connecting to the winch.  
- And a **trapdoor locking pin** built into the cage rig itself.

None of them are large enough to fully jam. But you're not trying to stop an engine-you're **gumming up the works**, adding just enough **stick and resistance** to make *everything slower, squeakier, and sloppier.*

Tashigi watches the lines weave with wide eyes.

&gt; &quot;It's like... citrus spider silk,&quot; she whispers.

&gt; &quot;Yeah,&quot; you whisper back. &quot;With less murder.  
Usually.&quot;

---

Then, as you let your hand rest again-still connected by the thinnest of threads-you shift your gaze.

**To Vivi.**

You study her with a teacher's eye-like she's the one student who hasn't said a word all semester, but might snap under the pressure of finals week.

&gt; She's shaking. Not in fear-**in control**.  
&gt; Shoulders tight. Eyes alert.  
&gt; Her hands, clenched around the bars, are **tapping-left, left, pause, right. Left, left, pause, right.**

&gt; **A code? A pattern?** Could be nerves. Could be signal.  
&gt; Her eyes are locked on Crocodile... but her posture says **she's planning.**

Then you notice something small but key:  
**Her foot shifts. Taps the base of the cage.** Once. Then again.

&gt; A rhythm.

&gt; *She's testing the floor.*

&gt; She knows. She knows there's still time.  
She's **not giving up.**

And that means neither should you.

---

**ð Status Update:**

- Juice tendrils now touching **four key points**: Lever, brake pulley, chain lock, trapdoor pin  
- Mechanisms are now **slightly jammed**, fully monitored by touch  
- Vivi appears **alert, active**, possibly planning or communicating in code  
- No detection. Crocodile remains arrogant and monologuing like it's his job

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi with a juice drop-tap back in the same rhythm. Let her know *someone* is listening.}  
2. {Tell Tashigi: &quot;We've got time. I'm building a juice line to the cage. We may need to cross fast.&quot;}  
3. {Begin building pressure in the juice tendrils. If Crocodile activates anything, you can counter.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi if she knows **how** the drop trigger functions-can it be reversed? Can it be sabotaged?}  
5. {Whisper: &quot;If he starts the drop... you go for the winch, I go for the hook. That cage doesn't fall.&quot; Finalize your emergency plan.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - I'm... I'm at a loss here. If he really commits to it, and if the cage mechanisms actually is an instant-drop, I'm not sure what to do. He could kill us in his sleep if we took him on. He's crocodile, after all.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Crocodile. He could kill us in his sleep.&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Dread | Internal Monologue Spoken Aloud | Confession of Helplessness**  
**ð² Resolve Maintenance Roll - (Eatone +1 Strategic Self-Doubt, +1 Realism, -1 Overwhelm Setting In) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Leadership Roll - (+2 Empathy, +1 Steadfastness, +1 Personal Guilt About Smoker) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You admit your fear-and Tashigi doesn't dismiss it. She steps into the leadership role *you're too honest to fake right now.*

---

You let out a quiet exhale-your hands are steady, but your soul isn't.

Your voice is soft, just above the sound of Crocodile's grandiose declarations below:

&gt; &quot;I'm... I'm at a loss here.&quot;

Tashigi doesn't move.

&gt; &quot;If he really goes for it-if the cage mechanisms are a true instant-drop...  
I don't know what to do. I can slow things down, but I can't stop physics.  
And if we take him on?&quot;

You glance at her, eyes wide with unfiltered truth.

&gt; &quot;He could kill us in his sleep. He's **Crocodile.** He took out *Smoker.*  
I'm not stupid. I'm not suicidal.&quot;

There's no panic in your tone-just brutal, **adult honesty**, the kind that makes you an excellent teacher and a reluctant hero.

Tashigi looks at you-and this time, she doesn't respond with fire or blind courage.

She nods.  
Quietly.

&gt; &quot;I know.&quot;

She watches Crocodile below-*calm, poised, entirely in control*. Then she speaks in that low, focused voice of hers-**the voice of someone who's been left in command by default too many times.**

&gt; &quot;If he pulls that lever, we act. We buy seconds. That's all we need.  
Because if anyone's going to turn this around... it's not you. It's not me.&quot;

She nods toward the cage.

&gt; &quot;It's *them.* That pirate crew may be the only group in the world reckless enough to survive this.&quot;

You frown, confused.

&gt; &quot;But they're kids-&quot;

&gt; &quot;They're **monsters.** Friendly ones, but monsters.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;The green-haired one once cut a galleon in half.  
The Straw Hat broke into a Marine fortress because someone insulted his cook.&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;...That's insane.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Exactly. So we don't fight Crocodile.  
We give *them* the seconds they need... and then we run like hell.&quot;

---

She touches her sword's hilt.

&gt; &quot;That's our role.  
*We're the delay.*  
You slow the gears.  
I break the chain.  
We turn seconds... into a jailbreak.&quot;

---

**ð Emotional and Tactical Update:**

- You've admitted your fear, and it's been met with trust-not dismissal.  
- Tashigi is stepping into command-mode, **shouldering the suicidal pressure** so you don't have to.  
- Your new role is clear: **not to win. Not to fight Crocodile. Just to stall long enough** for the real chaos to wake up.  
- You have options now-but no illusions.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {&quot;Alright. I'm the slowdown. You're the break point. Let's prep.&quot; Begin reinforcing tendrils, get ready.}  
2. {&quot;I want to give Vivi a heads-up. If she knows, she might start waking the others up.&quot; Tap a juice thread down.}  
3. {Ask what happens if the cage drops anyway. &quot;Do we have a Plan B? Like... juice raft level Plan B?&quot;}  
4. {Start placing juice reservoirs along the ceiling. If you detonate them later, it'll create distractions or hazards.}  
5. {&quot;Alright. When he moves, you scream. I'll make it rain.&quot; Finalize your contingency plan together.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 4 - I don't know... But I suppose we've made it this far. Pat her shoulder lightly.

OOC: The more alert denizens of the cage may notice green liquid dripping into the room, but don't know the source. Perhaps it's a plumbing leak?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 4 Selected - &quot;We've made it this far. Might as well rig the ceiling with juice bombs.&quot;**  
**Tone: Determined Resignation | Action: Prepping the Field Quietly**  
**ð² Juice Reservoir Deployment - (Eatone +2 Control, +1 Stealth, +1 Structural Mapping) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Cage Crew Awareness - (Nami +2 Observation, Zoro +1 Suspicion, -1 Distance) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**â Outcome: You rig the chamber with silent, concealed juice bombs across the ceiling beams. The Straw Hats notice... but without context, they're just confused.**

---

You press your palm gently to Tashigi's shoulder-steady, warm, honest.

&gt; &quot;I don't know if this will work.  
But we've made it this far.&quot;

She nods once, no words needed.  
The air between you is solid now-**steel, not fluff.**

You raise your off-hand and **extend five small orbs of juice**, sticky and dense, flowing upward to the metal rafters and recessed supports of the ceiling.

They move like **silent ghosts**, crawling above the chamber like they're **sentries of the fruit itself**.

Each orb lodges into an unseen groove or lip above the following:

- One above the **lever control panel**  
- One above the **cage itself**  
- One directly over **Crocodile's &quot;throne&quot; spot**  
- One above the **pulley brake unit**  
- And a fifth-over the **exit corridor door**, just in case things go sideways

&gt; *Five citric bombs.*  
&gt; Primed. Silent. Suspended in tension.

One snap of your fingers later... and they'll **burst** in sticky, vision-blurring, **traction-ruining citrus hell.**

---

**Below, in the cage...**

Zoro's eyes open-one eye first, then both. He sniffs.  
Looks up.  
Sees a thin green drop-splat-hit the metal grate.

&gt; &quot;...Juice?&quot;

Nami glances upward too, eyes narrowing.

&gt; &quot;Plumbing leak?&quot; she mutters. &quot;In a deathtrap room?&quot;

Chopper lifts his nose and sniffs.  
&gt; &quot;That smells... like fruit?&quot;

Luffy doesn't move.

Vivi's fingers stop tapping.  
Her gaze turns upward-and **lingers** just a moment too long.

She knows something's changed.  
But she doesn't react.  
Just waits. Tense. Poised.

---

**Crocodile says nothing. Still basking in his own silence. Still waiting for fear to ripen.**

---

**ð Battlefield Update:**

- Five **juice reservoirs deployed** in key spots-triggerable at will  
- Straw Hat crew (Nami, Zoro, Chopper) has **noticed the presence** of green drips, but is unaware of source  
- Vivi suspects *something*, but plays it close  
- You now have **the entire battlefield prepped** for maximum disruption  
- Crocodile remains unaware. He is... too busy savoring control.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi-if she knows, she can wake the others, subtly prep them. Use juice tap to confirm you're here.}  
2. {Prep a trigger phrase with Tashigi-one word, and you both strike. Decide now.}  
3. {Prep your internal countdown. If Crocodile touches the lever, you detonate the ceiling immediately.}  
4. {Create a juice line across the chamber. In case you need to **swing in** hero-style.}  
5. {Wait. You've done enough for now. Let the pieces sit-see what breaks first.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 5 - Maybe Crocodile might leave to let them stew in their mortality. Maybe the cage lowers very, very slowly. Who knows, we might not have to go loud at all.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Let's just... not die yet.&quot;**  
**Tone: Watchful Patience | Action: Strategic Stillness | Hope: Maybe, just maybe, this resolves itself**  
**ð² Patience Roll - (Eatone +2 Discipline, +1 Cautious Instincts, +1 Every Adult Decision You've Ever Made) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Crocodile's Action - (Crocodile +2 Theatrics, +1 Sadism, -1 Actual Time Pressure) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: Crocodile doesn't trigger the trap. Not yet. He *likes* the waiting game. You gain another window. Your decision to wait is-**for now-**the perfect call.**

---

&gt; &quot;Maybe...&quot;

You whisper it more to yourself than to Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;Maybe he'll leave. Let them stew in it a while longer.  
Or maybe the cage lowers... real slow. I mean, he's a theater kid at heart, isn't he?&quot;

She smirks-tense but appreciative of the gallows humor.

You both settle deeper into the shadows above, **letting stillness become strategy**.

---

**Below:**

Crocodile finishes his cigar, flicking the ash near the edge of the drop pit. It disappears into the gator-churned water below with a hiss.

He doesn't move to the lever.  
Instead, he stands, turns slowly, and gazes up at the ceiling-**not at you**, just at the structure.

&gt; &quot;This place is beautiful, isn't it?&quot; he says, unprompted.  
&gt; &quot;So much iron. So much certainty. You drop a thing from high enough, it breaks.  
No questions. No debate. Nature, in its purest form.&quot;

He pauses. Then steps toward the exit corridor, lazily brushing the lever with one gloved hand.

&gt; &quot;Let them sit with it. A little longer.  
The mind breaks faster than the body.&quot;

He walks.  
**Right past your bomb above the door.**  
You tense.

But... he **doesn't touch the lever**.

He leaves.

The chamber's silent again-save for the **chain creak** and the **slow, soft mechanical hum**.

The cage?  
**Begins to descend.**

&gt; *But painfully, excruciatingly slowly.*

---

Tashigi exhales like someone who's been holding a live grenade under her ribs.

&gt; &quot;He's giving us time. Not on purpose.  
But we've got it.&quot;

---

**ð Resulting Status:**

- Crocodile has **left the chamber**.  
- The **cage is now descending**, very slowly-likely a psychological tactic  
- Your juice traps remain **active**, untouched  
- You and Tashigi are **undetected**, in prime position to intervene-or escape  
- Vivi is alert. Zoro is awake. Nami is suspicious. The stage is set.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now's the time. Signal Vivi. Tap a juice thread onto the cage-let her know *you're here.*}  
2. {Use the slow descent to your advantage-start constructing a juice catwalk down to the cage.}  
3. {Talk with Tashigi. &quot;If we trigger the traps... do we drop in, or run like hell?&quot; Time to choose your contingency.}  
4. {Let it drop a little farther. Wait until the cage is low enough that a fall wouldn't kill them if you messed up the catch.}  
5. {Begin prepping juice to **freeze or jam the pulley system**. You might be able to *stop* the descent.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 5 - That is a comedically slow cage drop. He really is a theater kid. Let's make sure he's actually cleared the room.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Comedically slow drop. Confirm theater kid has left the stage.&quot;**  
**Tone: Dry Humor with Tactical Discipline | Action: Security Sweep**  
**ð² Surveillance Sweep Roll - (Eatone +2 Perception, +1 Subtle Juice Recon, +1 Theater Kid Detection Bonus) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Crocodile's Deception Chance - (Crocodile +2 Paranoia, -2 Satisfaction High) = Result: 2 [Average]**  
**â Outcome: The room is clear. Crocodile has actually left. No fake-outs. The cage continues its long, dramatic descent-and you're free to act unobserved.**

---

You squint toward the hallway Crocodile left through, then glance back at the *agonizingly slow* cage drop, its chains groaning louder than your average homeroom complaint about group projects.

&gt; &quot;That is a *comedically* slow descent.&quot;

Tashigi mutters, smirking:

&gt; &quot;You weren't kidding. Theater kid energy. All he's missing is stage lighting and an internal monologue.&quot;

&gt; &quot;He *had* the monologue.&quot;

You take a deep breath and extend your senses-**both physically and through your juice network**.

One of your dormant ceiling tendrils **splits**, snaking silently down the corridor Crocodile walked through. You guide it along the doorframe, down the wall, into the shallow cracks between stone.

You feel **nothing**.

&gt; No lingering footfalls.  
&gt; No breathing.  
&gt; No temperature change.  
&gt; Not even a Den Den Mushi resonance.

Tashigi's sword tip lowers slightly, just an inch.

&gt; &quot;He's gone.&quot;

---

The room is yours.

- The cage continues to lower, slowly. Still about **5 meters from the water.**  
- The Straw Hats are stirring more now-**Zoro sitting up**, **Nami pacing**, **Vivi fully alert**.  
- Luffy remains slumped, but twitching. Alive. Maybe out cold.  
- The Banana Gators churn the water lazily below like they know **appetizers are being plated.**

---

**ð Tactical Status:**

- Chamber: **Clear of hostiles**  
- Cage: **Lowering very slowly**  
- Juice surveillance: **Maintained and secure**  
- Straw Hats: **No longer passive.** You may be able to make contact.  
- Tashigi: **Focused and alert**, ready for next phase

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Make contact with Vivi. Subtle juice tap, then signal the rhythm she used earlier. Let her know it's help.}  
2. {Freeze the descent mechanism. Lock it with juice. Stop the cage before it gets any closer to the Gators.}  
3. {Create a juice ramp or swingline to the cage. Prepare for fast physical access if needed.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi to circle down toward the winch assembly-just in case. You'll cover her from here.}  
5. {Wait another minute. Let the Straw Hats fully come to. You might be able to coordinate a strike *with* them.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - It's a pretty high drop from here. I can prepare a juice waterfall to drop me in, then I'll turn around and break your fall. Sound good? (don't actually construct the juice fall yet)

OOC: Meanwhile, the denizens of the cage observe their slowly approaching demise. Also the scent of tropical fruits. Its probably from the casino's passive ambient scents sprayers or something.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Juice Fall Plan: Soft Descent, Hard Resolve.&quot;**  
**Tone: Practical with a Splash of Heroism | Action: Pre-Planning a Two-Person Drop Entry**  
**ð² Planning Roll - (Eatone +2 Engineering Instinct, +1 Devil Fruit Versatility) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Trust Roll - (+2 Confidence in You, +1 Coordination Mindset) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: The plan is sound, the coordination locked in. Tashigi accepts without hesitation. You're not building it yet... but when you do, it'll *work*.**

---

You lower your voice as you kneel beside the lip of the ledge, eyeing the slow-drifting cage, still descending at a snail's pace toward that Banana Gator buffet line below.

&gt; &quot;It's a pretty high drop from here.&quot;

Tashigi gives a half-nod, already calculating angles.

&gt; &quot;Tactically poor for a direct descent, unless you're insane.&quot;

You glance at her, hand twitching slightly, palm wet with anticipation.

&gt; &quot;So I'll build a **juice waterfall**.  
You know. Surf my way down with some *citrus dignity*, then I'll flip around and catch your fall with a solid juice pad. Sound good?&quot;

She doesn't even pause.

&gt; &quot;Sounds good.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Really?&quot;

&gt; &quot;You've gotten me this far without either of us getting stabbed, crushed, or eaten.  
At this point, if you said you could knit me a parachute out of kiwi pulp, I'd believe you.&quot;

You grin.

But the waterfall doesn't form yet.

&gt; *You just hold the idea in your palm.*  
Like a card up your sleeve.  
Like a fire drill bell that hasn't rung yet.

---

**Meanwhile, in the cage...**

**Zoro** is watching the walls now.  
He doesn't speak-but his one visible eye is scanning slowly... then twitches as he catches a faint *glimmer* on the metal beam above.

&gt; &quot;Oi,&quot; he mutters. &quot;Anyone smell... fruit?&quot;

**Chopper's** ears perk.

&gt; &quot;Yeah! Tropical! Like mango or... kiwi?&quot;

**Nami** squints.

&gt; &quot;That's not the casino air system. This place is too deep for scent misting...&quot;

She walks to the bars again, hand on hip.

**Vivi** says nothing.  
But she taps the bars **twice**, then rests her hand *flat* against the steel.

&gt; Like she's waiting for a hand to meet hers.  
&gt; Or a message to come back.

---

**ð Status Update:**

- The **Juice Fall plan** has been verbally coordinated with Tashigi.  
- Execution is pending, but it will **absolutely work** when triggered.  
- The **Straw Hats are now more alert**-the scent of kiwi in the air is not going unnoticed.  
- Vivi seems **ready to communicate**.  
- You have **the initiative**. Crocodile has left the stage. For now.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now's the time. Signal Vivi with a juice thread-match her rhythm from earlier. Let her know it's you.}  
2. {Go ahead and build the juice waterfall. Quiet, anchored to the ledge. You'll hold until it's needed.}  
3. {Begin forming a juice shield-if things go bad, you'll want a barrier between cage and Crocodile's return.}  
4. {Send a juice tendril into the pulley housing. *Prep it to seize.* You could stop the drop mid-motion.}  
5. {Wait. Ten more seconds. Let the Straw Hats settle, let Vivi react first. She might act.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 5 - I start gathering juice in my hand.

OOC: Meanwhile, the bananagators get disturbingly close. Too close.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Hold. Gather. Watch the water.&quot;**  
**Tone: Tense Anticipation | Action: Delay With Purpose**  
**ð² Juice Control Roll - (Eatone +2 Focus, +1 Calm Under Pressure) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Gator Threat Progression - (Predator Instinct +2, Hunger Timer -1, Cage Descent +1) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You remain cool as the situation begins to boil. Your juice is ready. The gators are closer now. Disturbingly close.**

---

You don't rush it.

You don't jump.

You don't panic.

&gt; *Not yet.*

You slowly begin gathering a **thick orb of juice** into your off-hand, letting it swell-viscous and pulsing-like the **calm core of a tropical storm**. A shield. A weapon. A command. Whatever it needs to be.

The room is quiet, save for the **slow grind of chain over pulley** and the **rising ripple** of water beneath the cage.

But your focus shifts-not upward, not forward-

&gt; **Down.**

And what you see makes the hair on the back of your neck lift like it's answering a roll call.

---

**The Banana Gators are no longer circling lazily.**

They are **grouping.**

- One is directly beneath the cage now, circling in a tight coil.
- Another is lifting its **snout higher** than natural-**testing the air**, jaws slightly parted.
- A third... is **trying to climb the wall** of the pit-scraping claws on steel with a low, gurgled grunt of hunger.

Tashigi whispers beside you, quiet as death:

&gt; &quot;They know the drop's coming.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Or they've been trained to respond to it.&quot;

The cage is **five meters from the water.**  
Maybe six.  
The Gators?  
**Too close.**  
Close enough that one *jump* might put steel in its mouth.

---

Inside the cage:

- **Zoro is standing now.**  
- **Nami is pacing like a cornered cat.**  
- **Vivi's knuckles are white.**  
- **Chopper has vanished-likely hiding behind Luffy.**  
- **Luffy? Still slumped. Still breathing.**

&gt; But not for long.  
&gt; Because the water's **close enough to feel.**

---

**ð Tactical Update:**

- You are fully **juice-charged and ready to act.**  
- **The Gators are converging.** You've got **moments** before the cage hits striking distance.  
- Tashigi is watching your hand. **Waiting for the signal.**  
- The room is **yours**-but not for long.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Now. Signal Vivi-match her rhythm from earlier with a juice tap. Let her know you're here.}
2. {Start building the juice fall-now. Descend and intercept. Even if it's messy.}
3. {Trigger the juice tendrils-jam the pulley system. Try to **freeze the cage in place.**}
4. {Whisper: &quot;We drop now.&quot; Let Tashigi know it's time. Go for full entrance.}
5. {Launch a juice blast at the nearest Gator-alert the cage crew and scatter the predators. Loud, but decisive.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - A deluge of tropical green spills out from one of the rooftop vents. I slide out, riding the wave, controlling the juice such that it slows my descent. Upon landing, I turn around and hold my arms out, ready for a princess carry of a catch.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;JUICE DROP: Hero Mode Engaged.&quot;**  
**Tone: Daring. Theatrical. Righteous Citrus Intervention.**  
**ð² Juice Fall Execution Roll - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Creative Descent, +1 Tactical Momentum) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Gator Alertness - (+2 Hunger, -1 Flash Movement Distraction) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**ð² Tashigi Drop Coordination - (+2 Agility, +1 Trust, +1 She's Been Waiting For This) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: The drop is cinematic perfection. You descend like a pulp-slicked legend. Tashigi follows your cue flawlessly. The Gators? Momentarily stunned. The Straw Hats? Officially confused and extremely alert.**

---

From above, the first thing the Straw Hats see is a sudden **green glow**, bursting from a vent like the casino's AC system just got replaced with a fruit smoothie on overdrive.

A **torrent of tropical liquid** spills downward, cascading like a waterfall woven from kiwi and momentum.

And then-**you.**

Sliding down the flood, one hand guiding the flow, the other balancing against gravity and ridiculousness, your **coat flares**, your **hair lifts in the wind**, and for one glorious second, it's like you've been called down from the heavens-

&gt; -to **deliver righteous juice-based justice.**

You **touch down at the base of the platform**, boots splashing into the now-slick metal floor, the remaining juice flowing out around you like **liquid silk**.

And you spin.

&gt; Arms out.  
&gt; Feet solid.  
&gt; Eyes locked upward.

&gt; &quot;*Come to papa.*&quot;

**Tashigi drops.**

No hesitation.

She jumps from the ledge above with the grace of a Marine-trained swordswoman, coat trailing behind her like a comet, and in a single, perfect motion-

&gt; **WHUMP.**

You catch her.

Full princess carry.

She blinks.  
A little breathless.  
You both hold it for a beat too long.

&gt; &quot;You caught me.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'm strong. I lift students all the time.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...That's somehow less romantic.&quot;

You set her down, and she immediately draws her sword and spins to face the cage.

---

**Inside the cage:**

&gt; &quot;Who the hell is *that?!*&quot;  
Nami points at you like you're an anime plot twist.

&gt; &quot;I smell kiwi!&quot;  
Chopper's voice squeaks from behind Luffy's legs.

&gt; &quot;Teacher?&quot; Vivi whispers, stunned.

**Zoro** just squints.

&gt; &quot;...Huh. Style's weird. I don't hate it.&quot;

---

**Gators:** momentarily stunned by the flash of movement and citrus scent. One backs up, confused. Another snorts. A third tries to lick the falling juice.

---

**ð Tactical Situation:**

- You and Tashigi are now **on the platform beside the cage.**  
- The cage is **still descending**, now about **2 meters from the water.**  
- The Banana Gators are **temporarily distracted**.  
- **Juice waterfall remains active** for exfil or emergency maneuvering.  
- The Straw Hats are alert, confused, and increasingly ready.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal Vivi clearly-&quot;We're here to help. Hold tight.&quot; Begin the rescue.}  
2. {Call out to Zoro and Nami-&quot;You two. If you've got strength, get ready.&quot; Prep them for impact.}  
3. {Jam the cage winch mechanism with juice-try to **halt descent completely.**}  
4. {Turn to Tashigi-&quot;You guard the cage. I'll handle the gators.&quot; Hero moment, inbound.}  
5. {Snap your fingers. Detonate the overhead juice traps as a diversion. Showtime.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - motion to the caged to be quiet. Attempt to lock up the mechanisms with my built up juice. Point at Tashigi, then the lock.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Shh. Juice the Lock. Let's stop this drop.&quot;**  
**Tone: Silent Command | Action: Citrus-Fueled Mechanism Sabotage**  
**ð² Juice Lock Execution - (Eatone +2 Juice Control, +1 Prior Contact with Mechanism, +1 Held Charge) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Tashigi Coordination Roll - (+2 Tactical Compliance, +1 Immediate Focus) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Gator Awareness - (+2 Instinct, -2 Distraction from Descent Halt) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: The winch *locks tight*. The cage freezes mid-descent. The Gators lose momentum. Tashigi follows your signal with military precision. And the Straw Hats? Realize their lives just got a fighting chance.**

---

You raise your hand-**palm open, motioning toward the cage**-a sharp gesture for **silence**.

Inside, Vivi catches it first.  
She lifts her hand and echoes it: **flat palm, stillness.**  
Nami gets it. Grabs Chopper before he squeaks.  
Zoro? Already quiet.

You point next-toward the **cage's overhead pulley housing**-and then jab your baton toward it sharply.

**Tashigi nods.**  
She moves without words, stepping toward the mechanism, blade held down and tight like a scalpel instead of a weapon. She positions herself-**one precise strike away** from slicing the primary tension lock if things go wrong.

Then-**you act.**

---

The orb of juice in your hand pulses.

You release it upward with a silent, rolling motion of your fingers.  
It **flares across the chain groove**, splits into three strands, and **slams into the tension wheel, the central brake housing, and the backup safety clamp.**

The reaction is instant.

&gt; *SCCCCCHHTK-!*

The entire **pulley seizes.**  
The chain jitters.  
The cage groans-but **stops**.  
Two meters above the water.  
**Dead still.**

---

**The Banana Gators lurch**-surprised by the sudden lack of progress. One tries to jump, but only hits open air and **splashes down hard**, churning froth and anger below.

One of them **snaps at another**, agitated by the delay.  
You've stalled their feeding frenzy.  
**You've stolen Crocodile's timing.**

---

Tashigi remains perfectly in position-watching the lock like a coiled trap.

Inside the cage, **the Straw Hats all blink.**  
Zoro nods slowly.  
Nami grips the bars and **smiles for the first time since you arrived.**  
Vivi?

She exhales, shoulders lowering slightly, eyes never leaving you.

---

**ð Tactical Update:**

- **Cage descent: HALTED. Two meters above water. Mechanisms jammed.**  
- **Tashigi in guard position.** She's holding the fail-chain.  
- **Straw Hats: Now *fully aware* you're on their side. Morale: Rising.**  
- **Gators: Confused, disorganized.**  
- **Chamber: Yours. For now.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Speak up. &quot;We're getting you out.&quot; Begin unlocking or cutting the cage.}  
2. {Ask Vivi directly: &quot;Are you hurt?&quot; Check the state of the group. Prioritize triage.}  
3. {Have Tashigi assist with the cage while you form juice platforms below-just in case the cage drops.}  
4. {Prep a trap at the hallway Crocodile exited through. You don't trust him to stay gone.}  
5. {Climb onto the cage. Start inspecting the top for locks or vulnerabilities. Engineer this escape.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - remain silent. Motion to Tashigi's sword, then to the bars of the cage, and tilt my head questioningly. Observe the caged reactions.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;No Words. Just Steel, Citrus, and a Question.&quot;**  
**Tone: Silent Leadership | Action: Tactical Nonverbal Coordination**  
**ð² Communication Clarity Roll - (Eatone +2 Nonverbal Expression, +1 Situation Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Straw Hat Insight - (Nami +2, Zoro +1, Vivi +2, Group Coordination +1) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**â Outcome: The message is clear. Tashigi understands. The Straw Hats understand. You're not just random rescue-**you're a plan in motion.**

---

You keep your mouth shut.

&gt; No dramatic rescue speech.  
&gt; No declaration of justice.  
&gt; Just a gesture.

You point to **Tashigi's sword**.

Then to the **bars of the cage**.  
A slight tilt of your head. *&quot;Can it be done?&quot;*

Tashigi's brows furrow for just a beat-but then her eyes widen slightly with realization.

&gt; She nods.  
&gt; Once. Firm. Controlled.

She steps closer to the cage, running two fingers along a bar. Tests it.  
Her blade shifts in her grip.

She mouths, silently:

&gt; **Seastone.**

Then crosses her arms to form an &quot;X&quot;-**can't cut it.**

&gt; *Damn.*

---

But your eyes stay on the cage.

You shift your gaze inside. Watch the crew.

**Vivi's expression shifts first**-from fear to a kind of **purposeful calculation.** She watches you like someone who's suddenly found the thread of a riddle.

She taps the bar softly-twice, pause, twice.

&gt; *&quot;I understand.&quot;*

**Nami watches your exchange**, then eyes the winch assembly and chain brake-realization dawning.  
She nods at Vivi.

&gt; &quot;They're planning something.&quot;

**Zoro squats, tension coiled.**  
One hand on his bandana.  
Just in case.

**Chopper peeks from behind Luffy.**  
&gt; &quot;I think the pineapple guy's with us!&quot;

Luffy's eyes open slightly.  
He blinks once.  
Smiles.

&gt; &quot;He smells like juice.&quot;

---

Tashigi whispers beside you:

&gt; &quot;We can't cut the bars.  
But if we disengage the top link... we might be able to lift the whole thing with your juice. Or tip it.&quot;

She watches you.

&gt; &quot;You want to make this cage useless, Cheng... you've got about **thirty seconds** before Crocodile realizes he forgot to monologue about *why he's always one step ahead.*&quot;

---

**ð Status Recap:**

- **Cage is jammed mid-drop. Seastone bars: uncuttable.**  
- Straw Hats: **Fully aware.** Mentally synced. Ready to move on your lead.  
- Vivi: Actively following your visual cues.  
- Tashigi: Awaiting your next direction.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Climb the cage. Inspect or begin juice-dissolving the top link. Try to open it like a kiwi.}  
2. {Send juice into the link joint, swell it slowly, try to *pop* it from the inside. Quiet force.}  
3. {Tilt the cage-build a juice ramp on one side and tip the cage just enough to unseat it. Risky but dramatic.}  
4. {Look to Nami and Vivi. Motion for them to be ready to move. Juice will do the rest.}  
5. {Hold position. Lay more juice into the pulley above. You *might* be able to reverse the winch.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - start pacing nervously, quietly. Shit, cutting the bars was Plan A. I don't think I'll have time to destroy the mechanisms before Croc notices something off...

I eye the lock. It's not Seastone, but it sure looks hardened. Maybe not cuttable. but maybe, a kiwi key...

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Plan A is dead. Long live... the Kiwi Key.&quot;**  
**Tone: Rapid-Onset Anxiety Meets MacGyver-Level Improvisation**  
**ð² Improvisational Insight Roll - (Eatone +2 Cleverness, +1 Pressure-Stress Thinking, +1 Fruit-Based Improvisation History) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Lock Resistance Check - (Hardened Alloy +2, Not Seastone -1, Age -1) = Result: 0 [Mediocre]**  
**â Outcome: The bars can't be cut. The mechanism can't be yanked. But the *lock*? You might be able to **grow your way in.** And it might just work-**if you're precise.**

---

You start pacing.

Quiet. Controlled.

But not calm.

&gt; &quot;Shit...&quot;

You whisper it through your teeth like it might slide into a shadow and never return.

&gt; &quot;Cutting the bars was Plan A.  
Now we're on Plan... kiwi.&quot;

Tashigi looks over, alert-but doesn't speak. She can tell you're calculating.

You glance up at the **cage's hanging lock**, the only visible **hinge point** connecting the Seastone cage to the **steel-reinforced support ring**.

&gt; *Not Seastone.*  
&gt; *Not meant to resist power-just weight.*

&gt; *A weakness.*

It's old. Worn.  
Thick, yes-but the **keyhole is exposed**, and the steel around it isn't quite as polished as the rest.

And then your eyes narrow.

You reach into your palm and begin forming something small-something **thinner**, more focused. Not a blast. Not a flood. Something **precise**.

&gt; &quot;...Maybe I can grow a key.&quot;

You press your juice into the shape of a **soft vine**, narrowing it to the width of a **lockpick**, then curling it gently, letting it harden into a pliable, fibrous rod.

A **kiwi juice filament**, condensed, acidic enough to eat into cheap metal, and strong enough to **wiggle.**

You guide it with a twitch of your fingers-sliding it toward the lock.

Tashigi leans in slightly.

&gt; &quot;What are you doing?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Making fruit-based locksmithing history.&quot;

---

The filament reaches the keyhole. You insert it slowly. No force. No splash.

&gt; *click*  
&gt; *clack*

It squirms inside-like a worm in warm soil-**testing teeth, grooves, tension.**  
You sweat.  
Focus.  
Twist.

&gt; *click... click...*  
&gt; **CLUNK.**

The lock **jolts open.**

Not fully. Not yet.  
But the mechanism inside just **gave**.

**You're in.**

---

**ð Status Update:**

- Kiwi Key = *Inserted successfully.*  
- Lock = **Engaged and partially compromised.**  
- You may now attempt to either **unlock it**, **break it from within**, or **let it weaken further before striking.**  
- Straw Hats = Watching with silent awe.  
- Tashigi = Eyes wide. You can tell-**you've surprised her.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Finish the unlocking. Twist the key fully. Let the cage fall open-or at least loosen the frame.}  
2. {Freeze. Let the juice *eat into* the mechanism longer. Let it corrode further. Patience.}  
3. {Back away and nod to Tashigi-&quot;Now. One clean strike.&quot; Use the softened lock as a weak point.}  
4. {Break it from within. Swell the juice key. *Pop* the lock outward like a burst kiwi seed.}  
5. {Signal the Straw Hats-&quot;Brace. Something's about to happen.&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Keep poking at the lock, try to push up the pins with kiwi juice hydraulics.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Hydraulic Kiwi Key: Citrus Lockpicking Edition&quot;**  
**Tone: Focused Improvisation | Action: Pick the Lock Using Fruit Physics**  
**ð² Precision Fruit Engineering - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Control, +1 Lock Theory, +1 Improvised Pressure System) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Lock Integrity - (Hardened +2, Corroded -2, Improvised Maintenance -1) = Result: -1 [Disastrous]**  
**â Outcome: You don't just pick the lock. You *dominate* it. It gives way under your controlled pressure like it was made of butter. The cage connection is now **unlatched**-ready to open.**

---

You grit your teeth, lower your stance, and put all your focus into the twitching, **fibrous juice strand** inside the lock.

&gt; &quot;Alright... let's play house, Kiwi style.&quot;

You shift your fingers like you're manipulating a marionette, and inside the lock, the juice responds-**swelling in micro-pulses**, like little flexing muscles.

&gt; Push.  
&gt; Curl.  
&gt; Stretch.  
&gt; Compress.

The juice splits into five *sub-filaments*, each one **pressing upward like miniature pistons**.

&gt; *click... click-clickclickclick-*  
&gt; **KA-CHUNK!**

The lock **jolts open**, the pins fully disengaged by the *hydraulic pulse* of your fruit's power. You hear the satisfying **clang** of a broken seal and watch as the **reinforced latch arm swings wide**, now **free of the cage's hanging rig**.

The cage rocks, no longer tethered from above. Still held by side supports-but now?  
**Loosened. Exposed. One good push or pull could break it open.**

Tashigi sees the shift and whispers:

&gt; &quot;You got it?&quot;

You don't even look up.

&gt; &quot;It never stood a chance.&quot;

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro blinks.

&gt; &quot;...He just unlocked the cage.  
With *fruit juice.*&quot;

Nami: &quot;I'm not sure whether to thank him or report him to the Science Division.&quot;

Chopper: &quot;He's *amazing!*&quot;

Vivi's hand touches the cage's edge. She feels it.

&gt; Loose.

She turns to the others and nods once.

&gt; *&quot;Get ready.&quot;*

---

**ð Status Update:**

- **Cage Lock: Unlatched. Free.**  
- The bars are still solid, but the cage is now **ready to open or break with help.**  
- Straw Hats: Primed. Zoro and Nami look ready to assist.  
- Tashigi: Still watching your back. Blade up. No interruptions yet.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Motion to Zoro. &quot;Kick it.&quot; Let raw power break the rest open. He's got the legs.}  
2. {Have Tashigi slice the now-free connecting latch-completely disengage the cage.}  
3. {Build a juice platform below the cage. If it opens wrong, give them something to land on.}  
4. {Climb atop the cage. Use your baton to knock the loosened top free.}  
5. {Signal everyone inside-&quot;Push.&quot; It'll take all of them, but they can break it open with weight and timing.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - âHold out my arm. If they can get the door opened, try to catch them.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Come on, kids. I've got you.&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Resolve | Action: Human Cushion Protocol Activated**  
**ð² Readiness Roll - (Eatone +2 Reaction Time, +1 Bracing for Impact, +1 Moral Resolve) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Straw Hat Coordination - (Zoro +2, Nami +1, Vivi +2, Chopper +1) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: The team inside sees your signal. They force the cage open from within. You brace-and *you catch them*. Kiwi-soaked, bruised, but heroic.**

---

You lower yourself slightly, feet wide, arms out, and brace against the slick metal of the cage platform.

&gt; &quot;Alright...  
Let's go, kids.&quot;

You hold your arm out toward the caged crew like a lifeguard waiting at the deep end of a very stupid pool.

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro nods at you once.  
Then shoves his shoulder into the side of the gate-**metal groaning** as the now-unlatched section **buckles**.

Nami jams her heel into the gap with a loud grunt, shoving upward like she's kicking a tax form off a desk.  
Vivi and Chopper **pull from the inside**, while Zoro drives forward again-

&gt; *KRK-KRAKK!*

The latch gives.

The door **flies open**-not gracefully, but *defiantly*-and in a half-fall, half-scramble:

&gt; **They spill out.**

Zoro lands on one leg and spins sideways to absorb the force.  
Nami nearly stumbles, and **you grab her arm**, pulling her forward.  
Vivi doesn't hesitate-she **dives**, and you **catch her cleanly**, cradling her for just a breath before setting her down.

Chopper lands like a cat.

Luffy?

Still slumped in the back.

&gt; But breathing. Twitching. **Stirring.**

---

Tashigi's eyes widen as the cage empties.

&gt; &quot;You *caught them.* All of them.&quot;

You grin, a little winded.

&gt; &quot;Had to. I'm a teacher.&quot;

---

**Behind you, in the water:**

The Banana Gators **roar**.

They realize **dinner just left the cage.**

They're turning.

Fast.

---

**ð Tactical Status:**

- **Cage is open. Straw Hats (minus Luffy) are free and armed with awareness.**  
- Vivi is **safe. Breathing. Strong.**  
- Luffy is still inside-but showing signs of waking.  
- Gators are **reacting. Closing in.**  
- Juice waterfall still flows above.  
- Tashigi is guarding the winch, sword drawn.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Dive into the cage. Wake Luffy. Now. The crew needs their wild card.}  
2. {Begin forming a juice wall between the Gators and the platform. You'll hold them.}  
3. {Yell: &quot;Up the waterfall! Go!&quot; Start evacuating the crew, Luffy last.}  
4. {Toss a juice bomb into the Gator pit. Scatter them-hard.}  
5. {Ask Zoro: &quot;Can you carry Straw Hat?&quot; Coordinate for a clean, fast evac.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - That's a Seastone cage, I ain't going in there. You got the other kid, green? Stand defensively between Tashigi, the rest of the crew, and the Bananagators.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;I ain't stepping foot in that Seastone tomb. Green guy, you're up.&quot;**  
**Tone: Tactical Command with Full Citrus Spine | Action: Delegate the Rescue, Take the Defense**  
**ð² Command Effectiveness - (Eatone +2 Tactical Clarity, +1 Calm Under Pressure) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Zoro Response - (+2 Loyalty to Luffy, +1 Recognition of Authority, +1 Pirate Muscle Memory) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Defensive Stand - (Eatone +2 Juice Combat Readiness, +1 Baton Braced, +1 Environmental Awareness) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**â Outcome: Zoro bolts into the cage without hesitation. You plant yourself like a damn adult against a trio of reptilian nightmares. You are the wall between predators and your evac.**

---

You throw your arm out to stop Tashigi from moving forward, eyes locked on the Gator pit, and shout low and sharp to the swordsman now standing beside you:

&gt; &quot;That's a Seastone cage. I ain't stepping in.  
**You** got the other kid-**Green.**&quot;

Zoro locks eyes with you.

&gt; &quot;On it.&quot;

No questions. No sass. Just motion.

He **vaults the twisted cage door** with the ease of someone who's done this a hundred times, one hand grabbing the edge, the other already reaching for Luffy's collar.

Inside, you hear the rasp of steel on metal as he adjusts the hilt at his side.

&gt; &quot;Hey, Captain. Time to wake up. We got work to do.&quot;

---

Meanwhile, you step forward.

One boot splashes on the slick metal. Your **baton comes up**, Seastone tip gleaming in the dim light.

Your juice hand flicks once-**three droplets fly out** and harden mid-air into **suspended tripwires**, thin as silk and ten times as sticky.

&gt; **You are the wall.**

Behind you:  
- **Tashigi**, sword up, eyes scanning.  
- **Nami**, holding Chopper like a grenade with antlers.  
- **Vivi**, shoulder squared, silent but iron-backed.

---

**Below you:**

The Banana Gators **lurch forward**, jaws wide.

One **leaps upward**, nearly catching the edge of the platform.  
Another **circles wide**, preparing to flank.

They're coming.

&gt; And you?

You plant your feet, lift your baton.

&gt; &quot;Let's see how you handle a fruit you can't swallow.&quot;

---

**ð Combat Status:**

- **Zoro is inside the cage retrieving Luffy.**  
- **You are between the crew and the Gators.**  
- **Juice tripwires active.**  
- **Gators are closing fast.**  
- **Evac path (juice waterfall): open and active.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Launch a juice blast directly at the leading Gator's eyes-blind it, stagger the others.}  
2. {Let the first Gator hit the tripwire, then strike when it's tangled. Clean takedown.}  
3. {Order Tashigi: &quot;Get them up the waterfall. I'll hold the line.&quot;}  
4. {Begin freezing the platform beneath the Gators with sticky pulp. Make it harder to leap.}  
5. {Wait. Brace. Let them come-and counter hard.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Maybe I can scare them off. Prepare multiple droplets of Kiwi Juice in the air, and launch them like micro flechettes of very expired pepper spray at the surfaced gators.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Fruit-Flavored War Crime: Citrus Flechette Edition.&quot;**  
**Tone: Controlled Ferocity | Action: Kiwi Blitz**  
**ð² Juice Attack Roll - (Eatone +2 Fruit Weaponization, +1 Pressure Modulation, +1 Blinding Acidity) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Gator Resistance Roll - (Banana Gator +2 Tough Hide, -2 Sensitive Eyes/Nostrils, -1 Surprise) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**â Outcome: Your micro-flechettes strike with brutal precision. You don't just hurt them-you **scatter** them. One flails. One *screams*. The others **panic**. You are, now and forever, the **Juice of God.**

---

You exhale slowly, lift your off-hand, and let the pressure rise.

&gt; *Kiwi juice orbs-six of them-float mid-air*  
&gt; Each no larger than a marble. Each pulsing faintly with volatile citrus rage.

You calculate trajectory-**eyes, nostrils, open maws.**  
Then-*flick*.

&gt; &quot;Time to sting.&quot;

You fire.

The droplets **sharpen mid-flight**, congealing into tiny acidic flechettes-**pulp-loaded with sour enzymes and astringent burn**, each one carrying the **chemical vengeance of a poorly refrigerated fruit smoothie left in the sun.**

---

**Impact:**

- First Gator: Direct hit to the left eye. It **screeches**, thrashing in the water, tail slamming the pit wall.
- Second: Hit across its upper gums and inner nostrils. **Chokes violently.** Submerges in a panic swirl.
- Third: Sees the splash, smells the air-and **bails**. Full tail-turn retreat into the deeper current.

For a moment, the entire pit **erupts in chaos**, water splashing, chains shaking, foam flying. The cage itself sways with the backlash.

---

Tashigi stares.

&gt; &quot;You *pepper-sprayed an apex predator.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;Not my first faculty meeting.&quot;

---

**Inside the cage:**

Zoro now has Luffy **over his shoulder**, and is climbing out with the easy athleticism of a man who *bench-presses ghosts for fun*.  
Luffy murmurs something. Still half-conscious.

&gt; &quot;Smells... like breakfast...&quot;

---

**ð Combat Update:**

- Three Banana Gators: **Neutralized. Blinded. Disoriented.**  
- Luffy: Being carried out of the cage by Zoro  
- You: **Still standing in defense.**  
- The crew: Safe behind you, fully aware this is **go-time**.  
- Juice waterfall: Still flowing. Still the escape route.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Signal the crew. &quot;Now. Up the waterfall. Go.&quot; Prioritize evac. You'll go last.}  
2. {Assist Zoro-form a juice platform for his jump. Luffy's heavy. Make it smooth.}  
3. {Prepare a parting shot-line up one last juice cluster to detonate as a full-pit smokescreen.}  
4. {Back up slowly, baton raised-cover the crew as they begin escaping.}  
5. {Ask Tashigi to head up first with Vivi and Chopper. Divide protection and direction.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Look around for Smoker. Is he in another room? Also, where's crocodile?

OOC: Sanji may have sprung his Mr. prince gambit, unaware of what's going on below.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Status Check: Where's the Chain-Smoker and the Sand Bastard?&quot;**  
**Tone: Strategic Pause in the Eye of a Fruit-Flavored Hurricane**  
**ð² Situational Awareness Roll - (Eatone +2 Battlefield Focus, +1 Recent Recon Knowledge) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Environmental Scan - (Tashigi +1 Marine Memory, -1 Tunnel Complexity) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: Smoker's not in this room-**but you now have a strong sense of where he might be. As for Crocodile? He's off-stage... but the **air has shifted.** Something's *coming.*

---

You stand, breathing deep, acid still tingling your palm, eyes scanning the platform.

You glance to Tashigi, who's standing guard at the rear. You speak low:

&gt; &quot;Where's your captain?&quot;

She blinks, then curses under her breath.

&gt; &quot;Not here. This was the Straw Hats' cage only.&quot;

She looks toward a dark tunnel near the opposite end of the pit-previously sealed with a grated iron gate, now slightly ajar.

&gt; &quot;Smoker must be in the **secondary cell block.** That access tunnel links to Crocodile's *personal holding chamber.*  
He keeps âhigh-value threats' away from his spectacles.&quot;

You frown.

&gt; &quot;And where's Crocodile?&quot;

That's when it hits you. Not sound. Not vibration.

&gt; **Pressure.**

The **air changes** again, dry and hot.  
The scent of sand, faint but rising.  
Your hair shifts. The **juice on your skin tightens**, reacting instinctively to what's coming.

Tashigi's eyes narrow.

&gt; &quot;He's back.&quot;

---

**OOC Update:**  
Sanji, per canon, has just triggered his **Mr. Prince gambit**. He's in the casino above, manipulating enemy agents and calling Crocodile away.

**Canon Divergence Trigger: LOW.** Sanji's distraction might not work now that **you've altered the timing**.

---

**ð Tactical Intel Update:**

- **Smoker is *not* here**. Likely held in a **secondary chamber** across the pit. Accessible-but **not safely**.  
- **Crocodile is returning.** You can feel it. You may have **seconds** before he reappears.  
- **Evac path is open**, but time is **very limited**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Evac everyone. Immediately. No detours. You'll deal with Smoker *later*.}  
2. {Send Tashigi with the Straw Hats. *You* go for Smoker. Solo op.}  
3. {Signal Zoro-ask him to take Luffy up, then join you for a two-man rescue run.}  
4. {Delay. Prep juice tripwires and traps for Crocodile at the chamber entrance. One shot ambush.}  
5. {Call out loud: &quot;Warlord's coming. Move!&quot; Drop the teacher voice. Rise into full command.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit oh shit. I look at Tashigi with wide eyes. He's coming. Your CO's going to have to wait.

Frantically motion to the rest to huddle up around me, and start conjuring a large puddle of kiwi juice at my feet.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Action Selected - &quot;Oh Shit Protocol: Emergency Fruit Evac in Progress.&quot;**  
**Tone: Controlled Panic | Action: Defensive Extraction via Citrus Slipstream**  
**ð² Crisis Control Roll - (Eatone +2 Leadership Under Fire, +1 Devil Fruit Synchronicity, +1 Survival Instincts) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Crew Compliance - (Tashigi +2 Discipline, Zoro/Nami/Vivi +2 Trust in You, +1 Shared Fear of Crocodile) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**â Outcome: Your instincts fire at maximum capacity. The crew rallies around you. Juice floods the platform. **Evacuation is *imminent***-and this is going to be *messy, heroic,* and *damn citrusy.***

---

&gt; &quot;Oh shit oh shit oh shit oh *SHIT-*&quot;

You don't scream it-you *breathe it*, like a prayer, like a man about to cast a final exam into a bonfire.

Your head snaps to Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;He's coming.  
**Your CO's gonna have to wait.**&quot;

Tashigi doesn't hesitate.

She doesn't question.  
She **nods**.

You spin to the Straw Hats-Zoro now carrying Luffy, Nami clutching Chopper, Vivi wide-eyed but clear-headed.

&gt; &quot;Huddle up! Now! CLOSE!&quot;

You slam your palm into the floor and pour every ounce of will, fear, instinct, and **righteous juice** into the surface.

&gt; **FWOOOOM-**

A **puddle explodes outward**, growing like a living, viscous lake.  
It glows faintly green, thickening at the edges, **slick but stabilizing**, congealing into a **cushioned disc** wide enough for everyone.

Your shoes begin to slide.  
The air smells like **fruit panic and ozone**.

---

The crew piles in:

- Zoro grunts, steadying Luffy and himself as he plants his boots.  
- Nami crouches, one arm around Chopper, the other grabbing Vivi.  
- Tashigi stands at the edge-sword ready-**facing the incoming tunnel.**

She looks back.

&gt; &quot;You good?&quot;

&gt; &quot;No. But I've got **tenured panic training.**&quot;

---

From the tunnel:  
The sand *whispers*.  
The air gets *hotter*.  
You hear **footsteps. Slow. Measured. Death on a coffee break.**

&gt; **Crocodile.**

---

**ð Tactical State:**

- Everyone is now on the **evac puddle.**  
- Juice surge: Fully powered.  
- Crocodile: **Seconds away** from visual.  
- Smoker: Still imprisoned, elsewhere.  
- Option to launch **juice-slide evacuation** is **ready now.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Trigger the puddle. Launch the whole group up the waterfall in a high-pressure escape wave.}  
2. {Delay for two more seconds. If Crocodile gets close enough, blind him with a ceiling trap before you go.}  
3. {Yell to Tashigi-&quot;Come on, now!&quot; Pull her onto the puddle and **evac everyone, immediately.**}  
4. {Lock eyes with Crocodile as he enters. &quot;Sorry. Vacation's over.&quot; THEN launch.}  
5. {Give the Straw Hats a push. Send them first. You and Tashigi stay to cover the retreat.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - what are you going to do with a sword? Get in here! Pull Tashigi by the shoulder into the disc of juice, and then have it erupt like a reverse waterfall, an emerald elevator.

I can swim through it easily. Focus on pushing the others up.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;This Ain't a Swordfight, It's a Slip ân Save.&quot;**  
**Tone: Urgent Protection | Action: Full-Team Citrus Evacuation with Tactical Teacher-Lunging**  
**ð² Rescue Pull Roll - (Eatone +2 Strength, +1 Reflexes, +1 Bond with Tashigi) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Juice Control: Reverse Waterfall Execution - (Eatone +2 Devil Fruit Mastery, +2 Emergency Pushing) = Result: 8 [Legendary]**  
**ð² Crocodile's Perception - (+2 Awareness, -1 Tunnel Distance, -2 Emotional Investment in Monologue Timing) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**â Outcome: You pull Tashigi in *just in time*. The platform erupts in a blinding emerald geyser. You swim like Poseidon with a lesson plan. Everyone launches. Crocodile arrives **just** late enough to eat pulp and rage.**

---

&gt; &quot;What are you going to do with a *sword*?! This isn't a duel-it's a damn *evac drill!*&quot;

Tashigi's lips part in protest-but you don't wait.

&gt; You **grab her shoulder** and yank.

She lands with a thud on the **thick disc of juice**, and you slam your palm downward again-

&gt; &quot;EVERYONE HOLD ON!&quot;

---

The puddle **explodes**.

Not up-not like a geyser.

&gt; **Like a reverse waterfall,** funneled and focused, a **vertical emerald elevator** wrapped in spinning rings of juice, pressure-locked into a spiraling chute.

You dive into it as it forms, legs sliding upward, arms thrusting down-

&gt; *swimming against your own power*, legs kicking like a torpedo as you push the others upward-

- **Zoro** braces Luffy on his back, half-surfing the juice surge.
- **Nami shrieks**, gripping Chopper and Vivi as they rocket up the stream.
- **Tashigi** lands in a crouch beside you-then steadies herself and helps brace the lift's walls from within.
- **You** push from below, teeth grit, body half-dissolved in fruit force.

&gt; *The whole world tilts into green and roar.*

---

**Behind you-just as the last of your boot clears the platform:**

&gt; **Crocodile emerges.**

Coat billowing. Hook gleaming.

He sees only the **tail end of a fruit-powered miracle**, the last trace of an emerald flash-

&gt; **and the slap of a puddle in his face.**

He stands there, blinking fruit acid out of his eyes as the ceiling traps **burst**, raining citrus shrapnel into his freshly shaved villain ego.

&gt; &quot;...What the-&quot;

---

You all **erupt into the hallway above**, landing in a heap of bodies, steam, and pulp.

- **Luffy rolls off Zoro's back, groaning.**
- **Nami coughs, soaked but whole.**
- **Chopper shakes juice out of his fur.**
- **Vivi just breathes.**
- **Tashigi collapses into a half-sitting crouch, sword across her lap.**

And you?

&gt; You stumble forward, soak-dripping, lungs burning, pulse jackhammering.

Then straighten.

&gt; &quot;Okay. That was a *lot*.&quot;

---

**ð Tactical Outcome:**

- Entire crew: **Successfully evacuated** to the floor above Rain Dinners' prison chamber.  
- Crocodile: **Arrived too late**. Furious. Soaked. Citrus-blinded.  
- You: **Exhausted**, but functioning. Juice reserves strained but active.  
- The battle below? No longer yours.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Find a door. Lock it. You need **time**.}  
2. {Collapse onto the floor and mutter &quot;I hate summer vacation.&quot;}  
3. {Turn to Tashigi: &quot;We need to get Smoker. That was the warm-up.&quot;}  
4. {Look to the Straw Hats. &quot;Hey. Pirates. You owe me juice money.&quot;}  
5. {Immediately prep another exit path-this isn't over yet. Crocodile's still hunting.}

ð {Choose your action..}

&gt;&gt; USER: Flood the vent with juice, hopefully slow him down (unlikely). I point at Tashigi. Get them up and go! I'll cover you!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Action Selected - &quot;Covering Fire, Citrus Style.&quot;**  
**Tone: Heroic Desperation with a Pulp Payload**  
**ð² Juice Flood Roll - (Eatone +2 Control, +1 Environmental Use, +1 Emotional Surge) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Crocodile Resistance - (+2 Logia Defense, -2 Surprise, -1 Acid Burn Pissing Him Off) = Result: 1 [Poor]**  
**ð² Tashigi's Command Response - (+2 Leadership, +1 Trust in You) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**â Outcome: You flood the vent hard. The backpressure **douses the tunnel** in acidic, traction-killing citrus sludge. Crocodile is **momentarily blinded and enraged.** Tashigi takes the order-**and leads the crew out.** You're now the **last line.**

---

Your legs are trembling. Your arms sting. The citrus in your veins feels *used*, but your mind burns with one command:

&gt; &quot;Flood the damn tunnel.&quot;

You throw your arms toward the **vent you just blasted out of**, and **with the force of a firehose**, you unleash the last of your **pressurized kiwi reservoir**.

The green tide **roars back down** the vent, flooding the metal chute, **sloshing over broken trap triggers and walls**, and finally **splashes out at Crocodile's feet like a tropical tidal wave.**

&gt; *SSSSHHHHHHHHHHHHHHK-*

The juice **hits him square in the face**-again.  
And this time? You hear it. The **sizzle** of citrus meeting sand.  
The hiss of *ego damage*.  
The growl of **humiliation**.

&gt; &quot;-WHO IS DOING THIS?!&quot;

His voice booms up the shaft, thunderous and drenched.

---

You spin and jab a finger at Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;GET THEM UP AND GO!  
I'LL COVER YOU!&quot;

For a split second, she doesn't move.

Then she **snaps to it**.

&gt; &quot;Straw Hats! On your feet! Move now-north corridor!&quot;

She grabs Vivi and helps Nami lift Luffy as Zoro staggers to his feet, nodding once at you.

&gt; &quot;Don't die, pineapple.&quot;

Chopper scampers, looking back with wet eyes.

Tashigi stops once at the hallway's bend and looks back.

&gt; &quot;We'll meet at the palace! Don't be stupid!&quot;

Then they're **gone**-footsteps echoing down a stone hallway into **open Alabasta sun**.

---

You're alone.  
Juice dripping from your fingertips.  
A vent hissing with returning wrath.

&gt; Crocodile is climbing.  
&gt; And he is **pissed.**

---

**ð Tactical Status:**

- Crew: **Escaping.** Tashigi is leading them out.  
- You: **Alone. Spent. Still dangerous.**  
- Crocodile: **Climbing up the flooded vent**, citrus-blinded, sand boiling.  
- Next move is **yours alone.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Set traps. Juice tripwires, slick floors, anything to stall him before he breaches.}  
2. {Climb. Get distance. Regroup later. You did your job. You're not dying for drama.}  
3. {Wait at the top of the shaft, baton drawn. Just one hit. Make it count.}  
4. {Leave a pulpy, acidic parting gift. Overcharge the vent. Burn and blind him before you go.}  
5. {Brace yourself. Take a deep breath. &quot;Let's go, warlord.&quot; You're standing your ground.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Pineapple?!

Option X - attempt to follow the path Tashigi and co went down. Only to lose their trail. I... I don't have a map on me. It wouldn't have hurt her to wait another second...

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option X Selected - &quot;Pineapple?! Wait-Tashigi-*where the hell did you go?*&quot;**  
**Tone: Post-Adrenaline Comedown | Action: Attempted Regroup + Sad Lost Fruit Energy**  
**ð² Trail-Follow Roll - (Eatone +1 Environmental Awareness, -2 No Map, +1 Mild Citrus Residue Trail) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**ð² Emotional Roll - (Eatone +2 Righteous Frustration, -1 Betrayed by Speed, +1 Tactical Humility) = Result: 5 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You follow their path... for a bit. But the trail splits, and you're left in the quiet aftermath of your hero moment, slightly sticky, mostly alone, and wondering if &quot;Pineapple&quot; is a slur now.**

---

&gt; &quot;*Pineapple?!*&quot;

You sputter as the **last green traces of the juice fall from your sleeves**, still pulsing from the effort of the escape.  
You lurch down the corridor after them, feet half-sliding, baton still wet with adrenaline.

The sounds of the Straw Hats, of Tashigi's sharp commands, are already fading.  
You skid around the next bend-

&gt; Nothing.

Just **two branching hallways**, both dark.  
Both sloping upward.  
Both vaguely citrus-slick from your earlier flood.

You frown. Hard.

&gt; &quot;It wouldn't have killed her to wait **another damn second**...&quot;

You run a few steps into one passage. Pause. Backtrack. Try the other.

Still **no footprints**, no voices. Just the slow **drip of retreating water**, the faint **shiver of residual fear** still clinging to the walls.

You stop.  
Put your hands on your knees.  
Exhale.

&gt; &quot;I save them, I catch them, I tank *Banana Gators*, I flood a warlord's hallway like a busted juice bar,  
and I still end up **alone** with no map, no backup, and now I'm the *pineapple* guy?&quot;

Your voice echoes.  
Mocking.  
Your citrus-scented echo fades into silence.

---

**No sign of the crew. No sign of Crocodile-yet.**

But you are, for now, alone.  
**Safe-ish. Exhausted. Alive.**

---

**ð Status Update:**

- Health: Bruised but not broken  
- Juice reserves: **Low, recharging slowly**  
- Morale: Sinking but sarcastic  
- Environment: Labyrinthine corridors. No current threats.  
- Crocodile: Delayed. Possibly redirected. Possibly hunting.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Sit. Breathe. Rehydrate. You can't help anyone if you collapse.}  
2. {Start leaving small juice markers as you explore. Make your own map.}  
3. {Call out, softly. &quot;Tashigi? Vivi?&quot; Just in case someone hears.}  
4. {Press forward. You're finding a way out. One way or another.}  
5. {Duck into a side hall and hide. Let your juice recover. You might need it soon.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - Maybe those juice markers I dropped earlier haven't dried up yet. Attempt to follow them

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 4 Selected - &quot;Breadcrumb Trail, But Make It Juice.&quot;**  
**Tone: Hopeful Determination | Action: Following the Sticky Trail of Heroic Escape**  
**ð² Juice Residue Tracking - (Eatone +2 Fruit Scent Familiarity, +1 Environmental Memory) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Corridor Complexity - (Rain Dinners Basement +2 Maze Design, -1 Open Doors from Escape, -1 Juice Presence) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: You pick up the trail. It's faint-*not perfect*-but it's enough. You push forward through the back halls of Rain Dinners, on the **heels of your squad**... still sticky, still sore, and still very much alive.**

---

You turn slowly, eyes narrowing, nose sniffing like you're tracking down a bad cafeteria prank.

&gt; &quot;Okay... I *was* leaving juice behind. At least a little.&quot;

You crouch low to the smooth tile floor, trailing your fingers along the baseboard.

Then-**you find it.**

A thin, faint smear of **viscous green** sliding out from the edge of a hallway turn. Too controlled to be from a fight. Too clean to be anything *but* yours.

You **grin. Weakly.**

&gt; &quot;Knew you'd come through, Kiwi Trail.&quot;

---

You push forward, following the subtle citrus slick:

- A droplet *here*, on a doorframe.  
- A palm smear *there*, from when Nami probably steadied herself.  
- An empty hallway, but the faint acidic scent of **motion** still lingers.

You move faster.

Your legs ache.  
Your core *burns*.  
But your **willpower holds.**

---

At the next junction, you stop.  
One smear curves **left**, but it's thin.  
The other-barely visible-heads **right**, but with more streaks. **Dragging footprints.**

&gt; &quot;Zoro's boots.&quot;

You smile.  
The **trail leads on**.

---

**ð Status Update:**

- Trail Found: **Yes**  
- Direction: **Right Hallway**, mild uphill slope  
- Sound: Distant-maybe voices. Maybe movement.  
- You are still **alone**, but getting closer.

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Keep following the trail-quietly, quickly. You're catching up.}  
2. {Leave a small juice sign on the wall-if anyone comes looking for *you*, they'll know.}  
3. {Call out, once. Quietly. &quot;Zoro? Vivi?&quot; Just in case you're close.}  
4. {Prepare a juice pulse as a flare if you need help. Not now-but soon.}  
5. {Move carefully. You're not *that* far ahead of Crocodile. He could still cut you off.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Keep moving. Crocs a sand demon. He probably has FTS travel - faster than sand. I gotta get out of here, pronto

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;Move. Move. MOVE. Sand Demons Don't Walk.&quot;**  
**Tone: Tactical Urgency | Action: No More Detours, No More Teacher Patience**  
**ð² Survival Instinct Roll - (Eatone +2 Fear-Based Momentum, +1 Intelligence, +1 Terrain Awareness) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Crocodile Proximity Roll - (+2 Sand Travel, -2 Delay from Vent-Flood, -1 Citrus Blindness) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: You stay ahead. Just barely. Crocodile may be able to travel through sand-but you're cutting corners, hitting the right trail, and **outpacing his line of pursuit.****

---

You break into a jog-then a full sprint.

&gt; *Clack clack clack* - your boots hammer against the slick stone floor as the corridor tightens around you.  
&gt; *Faster than sand.*  
&gt; *FTS.*  
&gt; You hate how clever that sounded.  
&gt; You hate even more that it's probably **true**.

---

You round a corner-and catch another flash of **juice** on a brass door latch.  
It's smudged. Hand-shaped.  
Someone braced themselves here.

You slam your hand against the door and burst through-

&gt; Another hallway.  
&gt; This one **narrower**, but **brighter.**  
&gt; Above you? The faint glimmer of **sunlight through vent grates.**

---

The casino's above you now.  
You can feel the shift in air.  
And more than that-

&gt; **No sand.**  
This is **stonework**, not dunes.  
Crocodile would need to slow down to follow.

You keep running.

---

Somewhere behind you, you swear you hear a hiss.  
Not air. Not a gator.  
**Something dry. Ancient. Fast.**

&gt; You don't look back.

---

**ð Tactical Update:**

- You are officially **ahead of Crocodile**.  
- You've reached **casino-adjacent architecture**-the edge of Rain Dinners' public floor system.  
- Exit = Close.  
- Sunlight = Visible.  
- Sand Warlord = Still on your trail.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Look for stairs or signage. Time to surface. Time to vanish into the crowd.}  
2. {Kick open a door. Any door. You'll escape *through* the damn kitchen if you have to.}  
3. {Slam a juice seal over the door behind you. Might hold sand. Might not. Worth a shot.}  
4. {Call out again. If the Straw Hats are close, you're done playing lost.}  
5. {Dive into the next vent shaft and start climbing. You're almost out. Go vertical.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Look for a familiar corridor, back to the Bananagator racing bar

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Back to Where It All Began... With a Gator Named Snack Pack.&quot;**  
**Tone: Focused Desperation Meets Hopeful Familiarity**  
**ð² Navigation Memory Roll - (Eatone +2 Spatial Recall, +1 Citrus Scent Mapping, +1 Educated Guesswork) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You spot a familiar decorative column, then a broken neon sign... then the scent of fried kebab and overpriced alcohol hits you like a reunion hug. You're on the right path. The **Banana Gator Racing Bar** is just around the bend.**

---

You slow down for just a second-not to breathe, not to rest-

&gt; **To think.**

&gt; &quot;Okay. Neon pillars. Left turn after the water pipe.  
Right before the *terrible mural of Crocodile posing like a playboy centerfold.*&quot;

You scan the hallway-  
There.  
The wall curves just slightly.  
The floor pattern shifts-**tacky carpet** over cold tile.

And then?

&gt; **The gator logo.**  
Worn. Scuffed. But familiar.

You turn-

&gt; And there it is.

The gaudy, ridiculous **Banana Gator Racing Lounge**, somehow untouched by the chaos beneath.  
The fake sand on the floor still shimmers.  
The cocktail lights still blink.  
The **Snack Pack betting board** glows gently behind the bar.

You slow down.  
Limp into the space.  
&gt; &quot;I'm back...&quot;

The bartender-a different one now-looks up.

&gt; &quot;You... uh... want another daiquiri, sir?&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;I think I'll take mine... to go.&quot;

---

**ð Status Update:**

- You are now in the **casino proper**, at the Banana Gator Racing Lounge  
- No Crocodile in sight. You've **bought yourself space and time**  
- The Straw Hats? Still ahead. But not far  
- Rain Dinners is **fragile** now. The wrong move could still draw attention

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Leave through the front. Walk out like a guest. Bold. Brazen. Maybe it'll work.}  
2. {Cut through the staff corridor behind the bar. You know there's a route to the docks.}  
3. {Ask the bartender if he's seen a group of weirdly dressed people plus one Marine run by.}  
4. {Sit for just thirty seconds. Catch your breath. Then you run.}  
5. {Leave a kiwi-colored calling card on the betting board. Snack Pack would understand.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Sorry, did I miss the final race? I knocked a barrel of jungle juice over in my suite when I went to get my coat and spent the last half hour wiping it up. I gesture at my juice, soaked self.

**ð² Bartender's Awareness - (+1 Employee of the Month Energy, -1 Doesn't Get Paid Enough for This) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: Your lie sails *smoothly*. The bartender buys it-and gives you the exact intel you need. The Straw Hats passed through here **minutes ago**... and they're headed for the docks.**

---

You approach the bar, **dripping citrus**, looking like the result of a keg stand gone wrong and a fruit fight with God.

&gt; &quot;Sorry, did I miss the final race?&quot;

The bartender pauses.

You lean in, pointing at your **soaked, semi-dignified self** with theatrical flair.

&gt; &quot;Knocked over a *barrel* of jungle juice in my suite while reaching for my coat.  
Whole thing went *whoooosh*. I've been cleaning up for half an hour.&quot;

The bartender blinks.  
Then slowly sets down the glass he was drying.

&gt; &quot;...That explains the smell.&quot;

&gt; &quot;It's *Kiwi forward.* Boutique.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Uh-huh.&quot;

---

He leans in a bit, lowering his voice as he nods toward the **southwestern service door**.

&gt; &quot;We had a weird group come through like ten minutes ago.  
Kid with a straw hat, tall guy carrying him like luggage. Girl with blue hair. Looked rough.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They say where they were going?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Didn't stop to chat, but... pretty sure I heard the blue-haired girl ask someone how to get to the docks.  
Northwest gate. Hidden stair behind the blackjack tables.&quot;

He lowers his voice further.

&gt; &quot;Don't tell my boss I told you. I'm technically on *sandstorm lockdown service mode.*&quot;

You grin.

&gt; &quot;Your secret's safe with the pineapple.&quot;

&gt; &quot;What?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Nothing.&quot;

---

**ð Info Gained:**

- Straw Hats + Tashigi are en route to the **northwest gate**, using a hidden **stairwell behind the blackjack tables**  
- **You're minutes behind them**-but you're now *on the right route*  
- Casino floor: still bustling. Still dangerous if Crocodile is shadowing through staff corridors

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head straight for the blackjack tables. Find the hidden stair. You've got a boat to catch.}  
2. {First: swipe a drink from the bar. Citrus deserves a citrus chaser.}  
3. {Blend into the casino crowd. Move slow. Don't draw attention.}  
4. {Ask the bartender one last thing-&quot;You seen a Marine captain? Chain-smoker. Real grumpy.&quot;}  
5. {Leave a Beri tip on the counter, then sprint. You're done being subtle.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Head towards the main entrance instead. The obvious choice. The unexpectedly obvious choice. Maybe I can circle around and regroup with them.

OOC: crocodile is likely mobilizing his top agents to intercept 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 3 Selected - &quot;Head Toward the Front Door: The Ballsiest Move is the Simplest One.&quot;**  
**Tone: Cool-Looking Casual Under Imminent Doom Pressure**  
**ð² Misdirection Strategy Roll - (Eatone +2 Unpredictable Thinking, +1 Subtle Swagger, +1 Casino Familiarity) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð² Baroque Works Interception Roll - (Crocodile +2 Networked Agents, -2 Delay in Deployment, -1 Conflicting Priorities) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: You stroll right into the lion's den-**and the lion doesn't see you coming.** Crocodile's agents are **fanatically focused** on cutting off the *northwest escape route*. The front? Practically unguarded. For now.

---

You glance toward the blackjack tables...  
Then glance **away.**

&gt; &quot;Nah.  
Let's go through the *front*.&quot;

You roll your shoulders.  
Straighten your juice-stained collar.  
Wipe a pulp smear off your cheek with all the grace of a man who just held off apex predators and a warlord with the power of fruit.

&gt; &quot;Let them chase shadows.&quot;

You stride through the **casino lounge**, passing tourists cheering at the banana gator betting boards, no one giving you a second glance beyond the smell.

**Security staff?** Distracted.  
**Dealers?** Still calling bets.  
**Patrons?** Drunk and rich and uninterested in your drama.

The **front hall glitters ahead**, framed by towering gold-stone arches and the spinning doors to Rainbase's main plaza.

You pass a pair of **Baroque Works agents**-suited, earpieces, annoyed.

One is muttering into a snail mic:

&gt; &quot;-No, sir, the targets were last seen moving northwest-yes, the stairwell near the blackjack pit.  
No, *not* the guy from the bar. He's gone. Probably a decoy-&quot;

You walk **right past them.**

They don't even blink.

---

**Outside:**

The air is **hot**, but open.  
The crowd is bustling with street vendors, guards, travelers, dock workers.  
And on the far side?

You see the outer market wall-**the docks beyond it.**

You're free.

**And you're now on the *outside* of the trap.**

---

**OOC Tactical Note:**  
Crocodile's agents are now **fully focused on the Straw Hat + Tashigi escape** via the northwest gate.  
You've looped out wide and have the chance to **flank, regroup, or intercept** without resistance-for now.

---

**ð Status Update:**

- You're outside Rain Dinners.  
- You're ahead of the Straw Hats' likely egress point.  
- You are unpursued and **entirely off Crocodile's radar** for the moment.  
- Time to make your next move **count.**

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Head for the docks. Wait. Intercept the crew as they emerge.}  
2. {Find high ground near the northwest gate. Be their overwatch.}  
3. {Ask a vendor casually if they've seen a bunch of damp weirdos with swords and antlers.}  
4. {Prep a juice trap in the alley near the gate. If agents pursue, they'll eat pulp.}  
5. {Try to find a public Den Den Mushi booth. Time to **warn the Marines** about Crocodile.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - I'm probably 5 minutes away from getting assassinated. Might as well get help on the horn.

OOC: Crocodile may have activated a lockdown across the city and cut outside comms

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 5 Selected - &quot;I'm Probably on a Kill List-Might as Well Dial the Navy.&quot;**  
**Tone: Deadpan Urgency | Action: Try to Warn the Marines Before the Lines Go Dark**  
**ð² Den Den Mushi Access Roll - (Eatone +2 City Awareness, +1 Luck, -2 Emergency Lockdown Protocols) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**ð² Crocodile's Lockdown Interference - (+2 Control of Rainbase Infrastructure, -1 Short Notice, -1 System Lag) = Result: 4 [Good]**  
**â Outcome: You find a Den Den Mushi booth. You even dial. But just as it begins to connect... the line **goes dead.** Crocodile's grip is already closing.

---

&gt; &quot;If I'm going to get murdered in five minutes,  
I might as well leave a message for whoever finds the body.&quot;

You jog across the plaza, eyes scanning, citrus scent still trailing behind you like a sad, juicy cloud.

Then-there.

&gt; **A public Den Den Mushi booth.**  
Dusty. Sun-faded. But open.

You hustle inside, slap a few coins into the port, and twist the dial like you're playing **cursed roulette**. The snail sluggishly lifts its eyes, bleary from disuse.

&gt; &quot;Come on, come on...&quot;

You dial your **home-island Marine office**-the junior officer you've had drinks with, the one who owes you for helping his idiot brother pass his math final.

The snail **blinks**.  
The receiver **crackles**.

&gt; *Ch-kkkk-Connecting-Khhh-Rainbase Central Outbound-please hold-*

And then-

&gt; *click*  
&gt; *BZZZZZZZZZZT*

Dead line.  
The snail **shudders**, shrinks into its shell, and **shuts down.**

A little red tag flaps down in front of your face:

&gt; **&quot;EMERGENCY LOCKDOWN - ALL OUTBOUND LINES JAMMED PER CITY COMMAND&quot;**

You stare.  
One eye twitches.

&gt; &quot;Yup. There it is.&quot;

---

**OOC Update:**  
Crocodile has activated **Rainbase-wide lockdown protocols**-all **external communications are now jammed**.  
The city is becoming a **closed box**, designed to crush and bury the threat inside.

**You, unfortunately, are the threat.**

---

**ð Status Update:**

- Den Den Mushi line: **cut. Locked down. No external contact.**  
- City: Entering full lockdown. You've got **minutes** before streets start sealing, patrols tighten, and escape routes vanish.  
- The Straw Hats and Tashigi: Still en route to the **northwest gate and docks**  
- You: **Alone, outside Rain Dinners.** Free. But for how long?

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Sprint for the docks. Find them, warn them-now. This is your last open corridor.}  
2. {Look for a quiet spot to hide and recover. You may need to outlast the lockdown.}  
3. {Find a local and bluff a Marine ID. Maybe *someone* can get you to a secure line.}  
4. {Search for a boat. If the worst happens, you need a personal exfil plan.}  
5. {Use the juice. Mark the roads behind you with fresh trails-if the Straw Hats see it, they'll know where you went.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Northwest? Which way is Northwest?

Option 1 - But head in a random direction that may or may not be Northwest. I have a 1/8 chance!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 1 Selected - &quot;Which Way is Northwest? Let's Just Guess and Run Like Hell.&quot;**  
**Tone: Heroic Panic with a Dash of Cardinal Confusion**  
**ð² Directional Guess Roll - (Eatone +0 Intuition, -1 Exhaustion, +1 Casino Architecture Familiarity) = Result: 3 [Fair]**  
**ð² Actual Direction - (Randomization Table Rolled) = *Southwest* (Close... ish)**  
**â Outcome: You *do not* run northwest... but you're not entirely off course either. You're now barreling along the **western perimeter**, a hair south of the intended rendezvous point. You're close. You're *juicily close.***

---

&gt; &quot;Northwest... northwest... where the hell is *northwest?!*&quot;

You spin in a circle like a citrus-powered compass needle with low battery.  
The sun's in the sky-but high enough that your usual &quot;shadow trick&quot; is basically useless.

&gt; &quot;Okay. I'll just... go **that** way.&quot;

You point dramatically toward an alley between two restaurants-smelling vaguely of fried fish and questionable shellfish.

Then you **run.**

---

The alley bends west, then slopes down toward the sea.  
Palm fronds whip past your face.  
A startled old woman yells at you in a dialect you don't recognize.  
You nearly bowl over a cart of plastic-wrapped grilled squid.

But then-

&gt; You spot a **dock.**

And more importantly?

&gt; You see **people.**

Not your people. Not yet.  
But **sailors. Vendors.** Market dwellers scattering.  
They've heard something's wrong.  
They're **nervous**.

You're just **a few streets off target.**

---

**Somewhere ahead, the Straw Hats and Tashigi are pushing toward the *real* docks.**  
And you're **close enough to smell victory.**

...and also leftover kebab oil.

---

**ð Tactical Status:**

- You are *southwest* of the intended escape point.  
- You can **reach the rendezvous** with one more well-timed dash or **a smart navigation check.**  
- No enemies in sight. But **lockdown patrols could appear at any moment.**  
- You're running out of time-and out of **safe mistakes**.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Climb up a vendor stall and look for the Straw Hats from high ground.}  
2. {Ask a local which way the main shipping dock is-fast.}  
3. {Keep running west. One more street and you might see them.}  
4. {Use a burst of juice to skate forward, sliding between crowds at speed.}  
5. {Shout: &quot;Oi! Weird crew! Blue hair! Talking reindeer! Anyone seen âem?!&quot; Hope echoes are kind.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Yo! I'm about to miss my boat! I flash a few beris. Anyone camel taxis able to get me to the main docks? Pretend to be a wealthy tourist

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **ð² Option 2 Selected - &quot;Yo! I'm About to Miss My Boat! Camel Taxi-Stat!&quot;**  
**Tone: Haggard But High-Rolling Tourist | Action: Beri-Flashing Camel Extraction**

**ð² Local Response - (+2 Camel Driver Hustle, +1 Fear of Rainbase Lockdown) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**â Outcome: You flash the cash, and three camel drivers appear like magic. You're hoisted up and galloping toward the main docks in seconds-*just in time* to intercept the crew.**

---

You jog up to the nearest knot of vendors, trying to ignore the ache in your calves and the drying streaks of kiwi juice on your jacket.

&gt; &quot;Yo! I'm about to miss my boat-hey, hey! Camel taxi, main docks? I'll pay double! Triple if we make it before the sandstorm lockdown!&quot;

You **flash a handful of Beri** like a desperate big spender on vacation.

For a second, the crowd just blinks.  
Then-a **young camel driver** with a scar over one brow and a salesman's grin pushes forward, hand raised.

&gt; &quot;Triple? Sir, for triple we'll get you there before your juice dries! Come, come-Prime Camel Express!&quot;

Another two drivers jump in, trying to outbid him. You hop onto the nearest camel's saddle-ignoring the citrus you leave behind.

&gt; &quot;Main docks! NOW!&quot;

The driver **whistles sharply** and the camel *lurches* forward, sprinting down the sunbaked road, weaving past startled vendors and scattering children.

**Street by street, you close the gap.**

The air thickens with **tension** and the taste of imminent lockdown.  
Patrols are moving, but your camel slides past them with an ease bought by *coin and chaos*.

---

Then-  
The camel rounds a corner.  
The **main docks** open before you.

And **there**, pushing toward the farthest pier-

- A blue-haired girl-**Vivi**.  
- A swordsman lugging a rubbery unconscious man-**Zoro and Luffy**.  
- Nami and Chopper, wild-eyed, nearly running.  
- And at their back, Tashigi, sword out, **watching the crowd for threats.**

You're **maybe fifty meters away.**

&gt; &quot;THAT'S THEM! GET ME TO THAT PIER!&quot;

The driver cackles.

&gt; &quot;Hold on, big spender!&quot;

---

**ð Status Update:**

- You are **seconds away** from rejoining the crew at the docks.  
- No Baroque Works agents in sight-yet.  
- Docks are still **open**-but patrols are moving in.

---

**What would you like to do next?**

1. {Dismount in full style. &quot;Room for one more?&quot; Join the escape crew.}  
2. {Throw extra Beri to your driver. &quot;Scatter! Make noise-buy us thirty seconds!&quot;}  
3. {Signal Tashigi and Vivi-&quot;It's me! Move faster!&quot;}  
4. {Juice skate off the camel and into the crew, ready to blast any agents appearing.}  
5. {Quickly grab water and food from a pier stall for the group, just in case. You might need it.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: Scene shift to Tashigi's group.

When the bounty hunter told her he'd buy them time, she quickly made off with Vivi and her entourage, expecting him to catch up. To her growing horror, he never appears. A clash of guilt, and duty to get Vivi and the Straw Hats to safety clash in her mind.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Scene Shift: Tashigi's Group - Alabasta Docks, Moments Before Reunification]**  
**Tone: Fractured Focus | Theme: Guilt &amp; Duty on a Ticking Clock**

---

Tashigi's boots **pound against the sunbaked planks** of the Rainbase docks, each step dragging a heavier weight behind it-not just the growing presence of Marines, tourists, and whispering Baroque agents in disguise...

...but the **suffocating silence** from behind.

&gt; *He said he'd cover us.*  
&gt; *Said he'd buy us time.*

She throws a sharp glance back toward the shimmering heat-haze of the city's outer rim.  
No sign of him.  
Not a smear of citrus. Not a glint of soaked coat. Not even the sarcastic bark she'd come to find strangely reliable.

&gt; &quot;Dammit... Cheng.&quot;

---

**Zoro** grunts beside her, Luffy still slung like a sack of meat over his shoulder.

&gt; &quot;We stopping for something?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;You left someone?&quot;

Tashigi doesn't answer at first.  
Just clenches her jaw and picks up speed.

**Nami**, panting as she pulls Chopper along, throws a sharp look.

&gt; &quot;We don't have time for dramatic hesitations, Marine.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I know that.&quot;

Her voice is low. Controlled.  
Barely.

**Vivi** places a hand on Tashigi's arm. It's trembling-only slightly.

&gt; &quot;He said he'd catch up.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Maybe he already escaped by another route...&quot;

Tashigi exhales through her teeth, eyes stinging-not from the sun.

&gt; &quot;No. He would've said something. He's not quiet. He's *never quiet.*&quot;

The group slows for half a breath.

A **guilt-laced silence** wraps around her like a collar.

&gt; *Did I leave him to die?  
Did I just... let that idiot sacrifice himself?*

And then, that cold, familiar voice in her mind: **&quot;Your duty is to the Princess.&quot;**

---

&gt; &quot;Damn you, Cheng...&quot;

But she keeps moving.  
Because the world doesn't stop.  
Not for guilt.  
Not even for fruit-wielding teachers who bought them time they didn't deserve.

---

**OOC: Tashigi currently believes Eatone may have fallen behind-or worse. Her decision to prioritize Vivi and the Straw Hats is weighing on her heavily.**  
**The scene is now *primed* for a dramatic reentry.**

Do you wish to **cut to your arrival**, or allow the scene to breathe a moment longer?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: still with Tashigi - he didn't catch up on the corridors. He didn't catch up outside the back of rain dinners. And now at the main rendezvous point, he still hasn't caught up. She got an innocent involved in her mess, and now used his life to save her own hide. Perhaps he's dead, being tortured for info, or worse 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Still with Tashigi - Docks of Rainbase]**  
**Tone: Heavy Guilt | Theme: A Marine's Burden**

---

They're **almost there**.

The end of the pier.

A waiting **supply boat** - still being loaded, unaware it may soon be the escape vessel for a pirate crew, a princess, and a rapidly unraveling Marine swordswoman.

Tashigi's chest heaves-not from exertion. From the weight.  
From the image she can't shake:

&gt; *Eatone-back turned-shoulders squared-fruit-juice dripping-facing Crocodile.*

The thought won't leave her.

She didn't even *look back.*

---

She slows again-this time long enough for **Zoro** to notice.  
He gives her a sharp glance, jaw tightening.

&gt; &quot;You dragging, or are we about to fight again?&quot;

She doesn't answer. Just stares ahead. And whispers:

&gt; &quot;He didn't make it.&quot;

Nami spins around.

&gt; &quot;What?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Eatone. He didn't follow us through the corridors.  
Didn't make it to the upper casino.  
Didn't show at the plaza.  
And now-nothing. Still nothing.&quot;

She grips the hilt of her sword hard enough her glove creaks.

&gt; &quot;I got him involved.  
He was just a tourist. A bounty hunter on vacation.  
And I used his life to keep moving.&quot;

---

**Vivi** steps closer, gently.

&gt; &quot;He chose to help us. He *insisted.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;Because I let him.&quot;

Tashigi's voice wavers now. Barely.

&gt; &quot;Because I gave him *the look*.  
The one Smoker gives me when I have to choose between stupid or brave.  
He followed me because I told him-without saying it-that if he didn't, someone would die.&quot;

Her voice drops to almost nothing.

&gt; &quot;And maybe someone still did.&quot;

---

**Silence.**  
Just the creaking of wood, the far-off calls of dockworkers.  
Even the Straw Hats don't have a quip ready.

Not even **Zoro.**

For once, he looks almost... respectful.

&gt; &quot;You sure he's dead?&quot;

She doesn't answer.

Because right now, she isn't sure of **anything**.

Except that she left someone behind.

And she may never forgive herself for it.

---

**OOC: Tashigi's guilt is peaking. Her character is now emotionally compromised. If Eatone arrives soon, it will carry **maximum emotional impact.** Would you like to resume control and reenter now-or let this emotional thread develop further first?**

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: What do the straw hats think of the mysterious fruit man with Tashigi? Was he really a bounty hunter? Or was he an undercover marine? Either way, he seemed to have sacrificed himself to save them

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[OOC Scene: Straw Hats' Thoughts - Post-Escape, Pre-Departure]**  
**Tone: Quiet Reflection | Theme: Confusion, Suspicion, Respect**

---

As they wait for the ship to finish loading, a strange hush has settled over the Straw Hats. The breeze carries the scent of salt, city heat, and citrus that's still lingering in their hair and clothes.

&gt; The man who fought like a Marine.  
&gt; Spoke like a teacher.  
&gt; Threw juice like a madman.  
&gt; And vanished like a ghost.

---

**Nami**, seated on a crate beside Vivi, wipes kiwi pulp off her sleeve with a grimace.

&gt; &quot;Okay, so-was he seriously a *schoolteacher*?&quot;

She eyes Tashigi sideways.

&gt; &quot;Because that man handled two gators, a Warlord's trap, and a full room of gamblers like he ran the *world's weirdest PTA meeting.*&quot;

---

**Zoro**, arms crossed, silent for a long moment, finally grunts.

&gt; &quot;He had Seastone.  
Not standard bounty hunter gear.&quot;

&gt; &quot;So... Marine?&quot;

Zoro shrugs.

&gt; &quot;Could've been. Or just smart. But...&quot;

He looks out over the water, his one good eye narrowing.

&gt; &quot;He was scared. The real kind. But he still stood between us and those gators.&quot;

That's the kind of bravery Zoro respects. The **quiet kind**. The **&quot;I'm probably going to die but I'm doing this anyway&quot;** kind.

---

**Chopper**, tucked under Nami's arm, sniffs.

&gt; &quot;I liked him. He smelled like vitamins and juice boxes.&quot;

---

**Vivi** is silent. She's been that way since they hit the dock.  
But when she finally speaks, it's soft. Certain.

&gt; &quot;He wasn't a Marine. He wasn't a pirate.  
But he was *a protector.* He saved us because he believed in what we were doing.&quot;

She turns to Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;Even if it cost him.&quot;

---

And then there's **Luffy**-eyes still half-lidded, slumped in a makeshift bed of ropes and sacks. He hasn't said a word since waking up.

Until now.

He sits up. Slowly.

&gt; &quot;He's not dead.&quot;

Everyone looks at him.

Luffy scratches his head, looks toward the city, and shrugs with casual certainty.

&gt; &quot;Just feels like he's still moving.&quot;

---

**OOC Summary:**  
The Straw Hats are torn. They don't know who Eatone was-or *what* he was.  
- **Nami** suspects undercover Marine or government.  
- **Zoro** respects the fight and doesn't care about the label.  
- **Chopper** thinks he was cool.  
- **Vivi** is shaken, quietly reverent.  
- **Luffy**? Believes. No explanation. Just *feels it.*

They view him as someone who might've **sacrificed himself for them**-and whether that means they owe him, or that *he was one of them for a moment*, is something each is processing in their own way.

Would you like to **cut to Eatone's dramatic arrival now**, or let the Straw Hats linger in that uncertainty a little longer?

&gt;&gt; USER: Meanwhile at the camel. 

I pat the driver, telling him to let me off early. If someone sees me with him, he might get stuck on a kill list. I approach the dock stealthily (in case of watching Baroque agents), and notice that Tashigi looks absolutely miserable for some reason. Odd (I have no idea why)

OOC: Usopp and Sanji rendezvous with the other straw hats

OOC: Player character controls dislogue, may have window to respond to NPCs

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Scene: Rainbase Docks - Moments Before the Crew's Departure]**  
**Tone: Calm Before the Next Storm | Mood: Tense, Quietly Hopeful**

---

**You pat the camel driver on the arm** before the final stretch, the dock now visible down a gently sloped street littered with crates, squawking gulls, and the occasional guard barking vague lockdown orders.

&gt; &quot;Let me off here.&quot;

The driver blinks. &quot;But sir-&quot;

&gt; &quot;If they spot you with me, you're gonna end up on a Warlord's kill list.&quot;

You hand him the promised triple fare-and a little extra.

&gt; &quot;Buy your camel something nice. Something not fermented.&quot;

He salutes you like he has *any* idea who you are, then clicks his tongue and fades into the backstreets like a good NPC who wants to live.

---

You slip down the alleyways-**stealth mode** activated not by training, but by sheer stress-based instinct.  
A couple of fruit crates provide cover. You duck behind a fish stand.  
You *blend in*-sort of.

&gt; You reach the edge of the docks-just far enough to see the group boarding the ship.

And that's when you notice **Tashigi**.

---

**She's hunched forward**, half-sitting on a mooring post, gripping her sword like it's the only thing keeping her spine intact.  
Eyes distant.  
Face carved with something heavy.

&gt; Guilt?

Weird.  
She got the princess out.  
The pirates are alive.  
She should be smug as hell.

&gt; But she looks *wrecked.*

---

Up the dock, **Sanji and Usopp** come skidding into view, Sanji panting, Usopp wide-eyed and gesturing like he just fought twenty people off with a ladle.

&gt; &quot;There they are!&quot; Usopp shouts. &quot;I told you I knew where they'd be!&quot;

Sanji ignores him.  
Looks to Nami first.  
Then Vivi.  
Then frowns.

&gt; &quot;Where's the pineapple guy?&quot;

Nami opens her mouth to respond-  
But then Vivi's head **snaps up.**  
She looks out toward the side pier.

Right.  
Toward **you**.

---

You now have a **window to act.**

Do you approach openly?  
Sneak up behind them?  
Yell something stupid?  
Wait for Tashigi to notice you?

**You are in control.**  
What's your move?

&gt;&gt; USER: Huh. Seems like there's none of Croc's boys here, if they're all standing out in the open. Get up and jog over like nothing happened.

Ey, glad you made it out in one piece, petty officer. I do a small salute to Tashigi, and nod to Vivi. Princess.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - Reentry: Casual Mode Activated]**  
**Tone: Quiet Impact | Mood: Relief Drenched in Shock**  
**ð² Crew Reaction Roll - (Tashigi +2 Emotional Guilt Spiral, -2 Unexpected Resurrection Shock) = 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You land your casual reentry *perfectly*. The crew freezes. Tashigi turns, stunned. Vivi softens immediately. The Straw Hats are floored-and a moment that was wrapped in mourning turns into stunned, *breathless* joy.**

---

You jog across the dock like you're just catching up after grabbing a drink from the bar.

&gt; &quot;Ey, glad you made it out in one piece, Petty Officer.&quot;

You offer Tashigi a **small salute**-just enough formality to sting, just enough sarcasm to spark.

&gt; &quot;Princess.&quot;  
A short nod to Vivi. Crisp. Respectful. *Cordial Bounty Hunter mode: on.*

---

The effect is... **devastating.**

Tashigi **jerks upright** like someone yanked a live wire through her spine.  
She spins, eyes wide-just as **Vivi lets out a quiet gasp.**

&gt; &quot;You-&quot;  
Tashigi starts, but the words die halfway.

She steps forward like she's going to hit you. Or hug you. Or yell at you.

&gt; &quot;You-You-You absolute-*moron!*&quot;

She slaps your arm with the side of her fist, no force behind it.

&gt; &quot;You said you'd be right behind us!&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yeah,&quot; you smirk. &quot;Took the scenic route. Might've knocked over a vent. Bit of a citrus mess.&quot;

She stares at you.  
Blinks rapidly.  
Jaw tight.  
Eyes glassy.

Then turns around like she's looking for something to punch.

---

**Vivi**, on the other hand, simply steps forward and places her hand over yours.

&gt; &quot;You came back.&quot;

A statement. Not a question.  
You feel the **weight** in it, the knowledge that she's seen too many people *not* come back.

---

The Straw Hats are a mix of **shocked, smug, and openly relieved**:

- **Zoro** raises an eyebrow and nods. &quot;Told you he wasn't dead.&quot;
- **Chopper** immediately hides behind a barrel and peeks out, sniffly: &quot;I *knew* he was okay!&quot;
- **Nami** crosses her arms, suspicious: &quot;Alright, now I *really* want to know what your deal is.&quot;
- **Luffy**, from the rope pile, grins: &quot;Smells like juice.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** finally turns back to you, jaw clenched.

&gt; &quot;You... jerk.&quot;

A beat. Then:

&gt; &quot;I'm... glad you're alive.&quot;

---

**You are fully reintegrated with the crew.**  
**Morale: Spiked.  
Tension: Broken.  
Reputation: Mysterious Hero, Fully Intact.**

---

**What would you like to say or do next?**  
This moment is **yours**.

&gt;&gt; USER: I frown at Tashigi. Would've been nice if you left me a map. I ended up running circles around the tunnels. Ended up exiting through the front door, somehow.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - The Citrus Cometh]**  
**Tone: Post-Tension Banter | Mood: Lightened, Awkward, Deeply Human**  
**ð¯ Emotional Outcome: Connection. Bitterness softened. The guilt still lingers, but your words hit home-and Tashigi feels it.**

---

&gt; &quot;Would've been nice if you left me a map.&quot;

You say it with a frown-not angry, not accusatory, just... the truth, in that exhausted, *&quot;you owe me a beer and maybe an apology&quot;* tone of voice only a fellow adult can perfect.

&gt; &quot;I ended up running circles around the tunnels.  
Somehow exited through the *front door.* Like a damn customer.&quot;

The absurdity hangs in the air.

Tashigi stares at you, dumbfounded.

Then scoffs-one short, humorless laugh through her nose.

&gt; &quot;You *exited through the front?*&quot;

&gt; &quot;Security barely blinked. You'd think a man dripping kiwi juice would get more questions.&quot;

Tashigi looks away, jaw clenched-then shakes her head with a rough breath. Her voice is low.

&gt; &quot;I thought you were dead.&quot;

She looks like she hates admitting it.  
Not because she's embarrassed.  
But because it *hurt*.

&gt; &quot;We made it to the upper floors. You never came.  
We reached the docks-still nothing.  
I thought... I'd left you to die for a mission.&quot;

A pause.

Then softer:

&gt; &quot;For me.&quot;

---

The group grows quiet again.

Vivi gently adjusts Luffy's straw hat where it's drooped over his eyes.

Zoro watches you both-then glances away like this conversation's too sharp to eavesdrop on without bleeding.

Even Nami doesn't cut in.

---

**You have a window.**

You can say something sarcastic.  
Something heavy.  
Something kind.  
Or say nothing at all.

**What do you say or do?**

&gt;&gt; USER: âEy, better it happen to lil ol me than a nice girl like you. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - Reconnection at the Edge of Escape]**  
**Tone: Quiet Comfort | Mood: Forgiveness in Disguise**  
**ð¯ Emotional Outcome: You say just enough-and Tashigi hears everything you *didn't* say.**

---

&gt; &quot;Ey,&quot; you murmur, voice low, calm, with a tired smirk just barely tugging at the corner of your mouth.  
&gt; &quot;Better it happen to lil' ol' me than a nice girl like you.&quot;

Tashigi stares at you.

And for a moment... says nothing.

Then her jaw tightens-not in anger, not in indignation, but in a way that says your words **hit something she wasn't ready to show**.

Her hand flexes near her sword.  
But she doesn't reach for it.

Instead, she exhales hard through her nose-eyes misting just enough to betray what the rest of her posture is trying to hide.

&gt; &quot;Don't say things like that.  
Not like you're expendable.  
Not like *you're* not one of the nice ones.&quot;

She looks away sharply.  
It's the only way she can hold onto her Marine face.

&gt; &quot;You smell like juice and bad decisions, Cheng.  
But you did more than most officers would've.&quot;

Another pause.

&gt; &quot;Including me.&quot;

---

Vivi looks between the two of you with quiet warmth.

Zoro rolls his eyes with the faintest smirk. &quot;We *done* emoting yet?&quot;

Chopper wipes his eyes, then sneezes from the kiwi particles.

Nami shrugs. &quot;Let them have their moment. He *did* save our lives.&quot;

Sanji lights a cigarette. &quot;Guy's got style. I respect it.&quot;

Usopp starts scribbling in a notebook. &quot;*The Legend of the Fruit-Fisted Phantom!*&quot;

Luffy, from the ropes, raises one thumb into the air.

&gt; &quot;Good job, pineapple.&quot;

---

**You've made it. You're safe-for now.**  
Crocodile's trap has been **escaped.** The crew is regrouped.  
The ship is about to depart.

---

**What do you do next, bounty hunter?**  
Stay with them for the voyage?  
Slip away before the ship sails?  
Talk to Vivi or Tashigi again?

**The world is open. Your story continues.**

&gt;&gt; USER: âI raise an eyebrow. Sooooo. Is this ship moving? Or are we waiting for Croc to eat us? Chop chop!

A pause 

Er, I am allowed onboard, right?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Rainbase Docks - Final Moments Before Departure]**  
**Tone: Dry Humor | Mood: Bittersweet Levity, Right on Time**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You shatter the tension like a pro-again-and the crew? They *laugh*. You just earned your seat on this boat... whether you meant to or not.**

---

&gt; &quot;Sooooo,&quot; you say, looking around at the stunned, quiet group.  
&gt; &quot;Is this ship *moving* anytime soon, or are we waiting for Croc to come eat us?&quot;

You give a wide, sweeping gesture to the docks, like a tired manager urging a lazy crew to clean up after a school field trip.

&gt; &quot;Chop chop.&quot;

There's a beat of silence.

Then **Nami snorts**.

**Zoro actually chuckles**-a dry, amused grunt like a man who's been through *enough* and respects a good exit line.

**Chopper is laughing outright.**  
&quot;Don't say âeat us,' that's bad luck!&quot;

Even **Tashigi** exhales a sharp breath. It might even be a laugh. Maybe.

---

Then, just as the crew starts turning toward the ship's gangplank, you pause.

&gt; &quot;Er... I *am* allowed onboard, right?&quot;

You raise your eyebrow just enough to make it awkward.

---

**Vivi** turns and answers first-without hesitation.

&gt; &quot;You saved our lives.  
You helped protect my kingdom.  
You *belong* with us. For as long as you're willing.&quot;

**Luffy** grins from the pile of rope and pulp.

&gt; &quot;You bring snacks?&quot;

**Nami** sighs, already boarding.

&gt; &quot;Fine, fine. But if you drip on the deck, I'm docking your Beri.&quot;

**Zoro** shrugs. &quot;Just stay out of the kitchen.&quot;

**Sanji**, from the loading ramp, nods. &quot;Pineapple Man's got a room. One with airflow. He *needs* it.&quot;

**Tashigi**, stepping past you toward the ramp, pauses beside you for just a second.

&gt; &quot;You coming?&quot;

She doesn't look at you.  
But you can hear the tension bleeding out of her voice now.

&gt; &quot;You're allowed.&quot;

---

And just like that-

**You're part of the escape.  
Part of the crew.  
Part of the story.**

---

**The ship creaks. The gangplank lifts.  
The wind shifts.  
And Alabasta begins to shrink behind you.**

For now.

---

**Do you board with a flourish, a joke, a quiet nod-or a promise?  
You control your entrance. This is your epilogue beat.**

&gt;&gt; USER: â

&gt;&gt; USER: To the next arc - the race to Alubarna.

Cobra, finally getting proof of crocodile's machinations, leads an army to Rainbase to capture him, only to be captured himself. Bon Clay disguises as King Cobra has instigated a full on war. Rebel forces March towards the capital of Alubarna, led by Kohza, Vivi's childhood friend.

Vivi and the crew seek to get to Alubarna, crossing the Sandora river on an appropriated boat, to stop the conflict and reveal the nature of Crocodile's plans. Unfortunately, Baroque works are in hot pursuit. Crocodile seeks to get to the capital to find the poneglyph and end the war in his favor, with Miss All Sundays as his translator.

OOC: Changes from Canon - Smoker is still imprisoned. Luffy has not fought Crocodile yet. Robin did not revive Luffy after his first battle with Crocodile. Tashigi is now riding with the Straw Hats - for now.



&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[NEXT ARC: The Race to Alubarna - War, Sand, and Secrets Beneath the Dunes]**  
**Tone: High Stakes Adventure | Theme: War on the Horizon, Truths in the Sand**

---

**Alabasta burns beneath the weight of lies and rising swords.**

The rebel army, fueled by falsehood and fury, **marches for Alubarna**, unknowingly pulled by strings wound around **Baroque Works'** gloved fingers.

At the heart of it all?

&gt; **King Cobra: Captured. Impersonated.**  
&gt; **Bon Clay**, wearing the King's face, fans the flames from within.  
&gt; **Koza**, Vivi's once-dearest friend, now leads the rebels toward the capital-toward catastrophe.

The world sees civil war.

But beneath the sand, **Crocodile sees legacy. Power. Poneglyphs.**

---

**You**, Tashigi, and the Straw Hat crew have taken to the dunes-on a battered desert skiff that groans with every gust of wind and roars with every call to urgency.

- **Luffy** is still recovering, pale but stirring.
- **Zoro**, seated near the bow, sharpens a blade with one eye on the horizon.
- **Nami** squints at the makeshift sail, calculating wind speeds with swears and flair.
- **Vivi** stares ahead, toward Alubarna, toward a war she still hopes to stop.
- **Tashigi** rides close, one hand on her sword, the other gripping the ship's rail as sand rips past.

And you?

&gt; You're at the stern-hair wind-whipped, coat still slightly citrus-scented, baton slung, eyes peeled behind your makeshift shades.

Your mission is unclear.

&gt; You're not a Marine.  
&gt; Not a Straw Hat.  
&gt; Not Alabastan.

But you're here. Because you can't walk away when a city's about to burn.

---

**OOC: Canon has shifted significantly.**

- **Smoker is still imprisoned** in Rainbase, missing the opportunity to become a wild card.
- **Luffy has not yet fought Crocodile.** He is not battle-scarred or empowered by that confrontation.
- **Robin** has not interfered or helped the crew.  
- **Tashigi**, now alongside the Straw Hats, adds new moral weight-and **internal Marine conflict**.
- **Crocodile is ahead of the game**, having not yet suffered defeat or loss of control.

**You are an X-factor**-a man with the means and mindset to alter what comes next.

---

**What would you like to do now aboard the desert skiff?**

1. {Talk to Vivi-&quot;You think Koza will listen to you? Even now?&quot;}  
2. {Check on Luffy-&quot;Hey. You gonna be able to swing that rubbery fist soon?&quot;}  
3. {Strategize with Tashigi-&quot;We need to plan for a three-front assault: Croc, the rebels, and Baroque Works.&quot;}  
4. {Scout with Zoro-&quot;Any sign of pursuit? I've got juice left in the tank.&quot;}  
5. {Quiet moment-reminisce, plan, wait for the chaos to reach you.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Figure I might as well introduce myself to the crew. Despite them being... Pirates. They're still kids, they need a good role model.

Walk up to any grouping of them, and clear my throat.

So, erm... Pira- kids- I mean, whatever. I'm Eatone Cheng. Part time bounty hunter, part time schoolteacher, full time kiwi juice man.

OOC: Only I control the player characters dialogue. You may paraphrase for narrative flow.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - On the Dunes to Alubarna]**  
**Tone: Earnest Introduction | Mood: Mutual Curiosity, Humor, Bond-Forming**

---

The wind howls dry and relentless across the sand, the **makeshift skiff creaking** as it glides along the surface of the dunes, its passengers unified only by circumstance-and whatever snacks Chopper didn't finish.

You approach the **largest grouping of Straw Hats** clustered near the main mast-**Nami, Usopp, Chopper, and a half-conscious Luffy** reclining in a nest of gear.

A beat passes. You clear your throat.

&gt; &quot;So, erm... Pira-  
Kids.  
I mean-*whatever.*&quot;

Several heads turn. Nami raises an eyebrow. Usopp squints like he's trying to gauge if this is a monologue or a warning. Chopper's eyes widen. Luffy is snoring softly.

&gt; &quot;I'm Eatone Cheng.  
Part-time bounty hunter.  
Part-time schoolteacher.  
Full-time kiwi juice man.&quot;

---

There's a silence. Then:

**Chopper** immediately gasps. &quot;You're a *teacher?!* That's so cool!&quot;

**Usopp** gestures wildly. &quot;Wait, wait-you fight people *and* do multiplication tables?!&quot;

**Nami**, arms crossed, tilts her head with mock suspicion. &quot;So which came first? The juice or the teaching?&quot;

You can feel their energy shift-not wary, not judgmental.

Just... curious.

Like kids who just found out their weird uncle used to **fight gators professionally.**

---

Even **Zoro**, overhearing from the bow, cracks a smirk.

&gt; &quot;Taught anyone how to smack a warlord with fruit?&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, off to the side, watches the exchange with the faintest hint of a smile. She doesn't interrupt. Doesn't correct you. Just **lets you have it**-a moment to define yourself not as the man who stood his ground or got them out, but as the man you *are*.

Eatone Cheng.

The adult in the room.

Even if the room is on fire.  
Even if it's a boat skimming sand.  
Even if it's full of **pirates**.

---

**OOC: You've successfully established rapport. The Straw Hats now see you less as a wildcard... and more as their *own kind of adult.* Not an authority. Not a buzzkill. Just-someone who chose to help, and didn't lecture them for being young.**

You may now interact with specific crew members more naturally, or direct the next event in this arc's race.

Would you like to keep the moment light, or steer into the next serious beat (Baroque pursuit, Alubarna approach, or a moment alone with a character)?

&gt;&gt; USER: To Luffy - shoot a squirt of green kiwi juice into his mouth. It's sour.

To Zoro - I'm here on vacation, green. I dont, didn't, and never intend on fighting a warlord. Frankly, once we get back away from Rainbase and back on land, I'm thinking of finding the nearest ocean liner out of this country.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - To Alubarna, With Citrus]**  
**Tone: Deadpan Meets Honesty | Mood: Sour Wakeups and Soft Boundaries**

---

Luffy's mouth is open in sleep, half-snoring, half-muttering something about &quot;meat crocodiles&quot; and &quot;juice cannons.&quot;

You lean down, raise two fingers, and with a precise flick-

&gt; *PHTEW!*

A **sharp squirt** of fresh kiwi juice arcs through the air and hits Luffy square in the mouth.

His lips smack once.

Then his whole body twitches.

&gt; &quot;*GAH-SOUR!*&quot;

He jerks up, eyes wide, arms flailing for a second before he realizes **he's not being eaten.**

You raise a brow.

&gt; &quot;You're welcome.&quot;

He blinks, squints at you, and slowly grins through the sour shudder.

&gt; &quot;Hey... juice guy!&quot;

Then falls immediately back into his nap.

---

You stroll over toward **Zoro**, who's leaning against a crate with a sword laid across his legs, the sun glinting off his earrings. He doesn't look at you, but his eye shifts your way the second you start talking.

&gt; &quot;Just so we're clear, green-  
I'm here on vacation.  
Didn't plan on fighting a Warlord. Don't.  
And once we get back to dry land?  
I'm finding the nearest ocean liner and booking it *out* of this madhouse of a country.&quot;

Zoro snorts softly.

&gt; &quot;Guess we all showed up here with different plans.&quot;

He sharpens his blade with slow, steady strokes.

&gt; &quot;You're not wrong for wanting out.  
But for a guy who doesn't want to fight Warlords... you sure keep getting in front of them.&quot;

His tone isn't accusing.  
It's observant. A hint of respect behind the sarcasm.

&gt; &quot;Guess we'll see what you *really* do when Crocodile shows up again.&quot;

---

**OOC: You've drawn a clear line for yourself-**you're not here for the war. You're not here to save kingdoms.

But Zoro sees through that a little.

Because you're *still here*.

---

Would you like to continue the moment, move to a private chat with Tashigi or Vivi, or shift toward the next major event: **Baroque Works intercept** or **arrival at the Sandora River crossing**?

&gt;&gt; USER: Getting in front of them, because you kids keep getting in front of them first. I sigh. Someone has to keep you young ones safe.

OOC: The player character is in his late 20's. A little older than Tashigi, about a decade older than most of the Straw Hats and Vivi

OOC: Vivi, Tashigi may overhear about my plan to get out of Alabasta at the earliest opportunity 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - The Kiwi Protector Speaks]**  
**Tone: Dry and Earnest | Mood: The Weight of Adulthood Among Youth**

---

&gt; &quot;Getting in front of them,&quot; you say, glancing sideways at Zoro,  
&gt; &quot;because you *kids* keep getting in front of them first.&quot;

You let out a sigh, the wind catching your coat as your gaze trails over the lot of them-snoring Luffy, starry-eyed Chopper, Usopp mumbling something about &quot;hero rankings&quot; in his sleep.

&gt; &quot;Someone's gotta keep you young ones safe.&quot;

Zoro's lips twitch-not quite a smile. Not quite not. He doesn't argue. He just looks out over the dunes, blade still balanced on his knees.

&gt; &quot;You're not as old as you act, you know.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Tell that to my back.&quot;

---

Behind you, **Vivi** shifts at the mast, her eyes having trailed your voice mid-conversation.

She's been quiet-watching, weighing, the burden of a kingdom heavy on her shoulders.

**Tashigi**, seated near the sail's crank, freezes mid-check of the rudder.

They both heard what you said earlier.  
&gt; That when this is over, you're gone.  
&gt; Vacation's over.  
&gt; No more heroics.  
&gt; Just... out.

---

**Vivi**, her voice soft, floats over the roar of sand:

&gt; &quot;You're not *that* much older than us...&quot;

She doesn't say it like a fact.  
She says it like a protest.  
Not begging you to stay.  
Just... trying to understand why you'd go.

**Tashigi** doesn't look back, but her hand tightens just slightly around the rope she's gripping.

---

**OOC:** Your comment-casual, honest, and responsible-has been overheard.

- **Vivi**, who sees you as someone who stood beside her when few would, is now quietly wrestling with the idea of *losing another protector* before this is over.
- **Tashigi**, who already feels the guilt of your involvement, hears a man distancing himself, and it lands... hard.

They may confront you directly.  
They may stew on it.  
But the tension is now in the air.

---

**Would you like to engage with them now-clarify, stand firm, soften-or let the silence carry as you approach the Sandora River crossing and the next phase of the chase?**

&gt;&gt; USER: âI shoot another squirt of kiwi juice into Chopper's mouth. This time, I will it to be a little sweeter than last time. Huh, why didn't I do that last time? And also why is the juice a little yellower?

OOC: I don't know about the effect my words of leaving had on Vivi and Tashigi.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Playing With Fruit and the Future]**  
**Tone: Gentle Humor | Mood: A Moment of Sweetness in the Rising Storm**

---

Chopper's nose twitches in his sleep.

You raise two fingers again.

&gt; *Pftt.*

A soft arc of juice flicks from your fingertips into the little reindeer's open mouth.

He smacks his lips. Blinks awake.

&gt; &quot;Mmm? Hey... that one was *good!*&quot;

He sits up, tail wiggling.

&gt; &quot;It was *sweeter!* Kind of like... kiwi mixed with honey? That was awesome!&quot;

You blink.

Huh.

You didn't exactly try to sweeten it.  
But you did *wish* for it.

&gt; **And it happened.**

You glance at your fingertips. The juice left behind has a faint **yellow tinge**-brighter than usual. A little more golden.

You mutter to yourself.

&gt; &quot;Huh. Why didn't I do that last time?&quot;

---

Chopper is now enthusiastically bouncing in place.

&gt; &quot;Do it again! Juice me again!&quot;

**Nami** raises an eyebrow from the side. &quot;Are we just handing out sugar shots now?&quot;

**Usopp** starts whispering, &quot;Kiwi-Kiwi-no-Juice: Form One... Reindeer Delight Beam...&quot;

**Zoro**, low under his breath: &quot;This is what you get when a fruit user is also a teacher.&quot;

---

You shake your hand off, watching the citrus droplets flick away. Something about the taste, the color-it responded to how you felt.

&gt; *Could your juice shift in flavor? Mood? Intent?*

Something to consider.

---

**Unseen by you:**

**Vivi**, watching Chopper's reaction, smiles. A real one. For just a moment.

Then her eyes drop. The smile fades.

She's thinking about what you said.  
About leaving.

---

**Tashigi**, facing forward now, is still quiet. Still pretending not to listen.

But her posture's rigid. Her grip, too tight.

She didn't miss the juice.  
Or the shift.  
Or the words before it.

---

**OOC Status:**

- You are still unaware of the emotional ripple your plans to leave have caused.  
- Your Devil Fruit power is evolving subtly-*emotion- or intent-based variation is now hinted*.  
- You have defused the moment with humor, for now.  
- The skiff nears the **Sandora River crossing**, the next major strategic point-where Baroque Works may soon descend.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Experiment. Try to create another juice with a specific flavor or color.}  
2. {Sit beside Chopper and answer his excited questions. Let the mood stay light.}  
3. {Finally address Vivi or Tashigi. Something feels... off.}  
4. {Take the reins and check the horizon. You've got a bad feeling about pursuit.}  
5. {Just breathe. Enjoy the calm while it lasts. You've earned it.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Go to Tashigi first. She still looks miserable for some reason. Perhaps she's worried about her CO still being stuck back in Rainbase.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Sandora Approach | Scene: The Guilt that Doesn't Speak]**  
**Tone: Subdued Concern | Mood: Hidden Guilt, Unspoken Fears**  

---

The wind howls across the open dunes, the **skiff tilting and cutting** over the golden sand. The sun glares above, distant but relentless. And through it all, **Tashigi hasn't moved.**

She sits rigid, sword balanced across her lap, one hand on the rudder crank, the other clenched so tight her knuckles are pale beneath the glove. Eyes forward. Unwavering.

But her shoulders...

&gt; They speak volumes.

---

You step across the deck-quiet, steady-and stand near her. Not too close. Just enough to be heard over the wind.

She doesn't look at you.

You glance at her sidelong.

&gt; &quot;Still thinking about Smoker?&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;You've been stiff as a board since we left.&quot;

Another beat.

Then she answers, low, almost casual-**too** casual.

&gt; &quot;He's... not the type to go down easy.  
Even if Crocodile has him.  
He'll hold out.&quot;

But her voice isn't steady.

---

You nod slowly, gaze fixed on the sand ahead.

&gt; &quot;Well, you're not exactly all sunshine and daiquiris right now.  
If it's not him... what else is eating you?&quot;

She finally looks at you.

Eyes sharp. Searching.

&gt; &quot;You said you're leaving. After this.  
Soon as we hit land.&quot;

Her voice isn't accusatory.  
It's **carefully neutral.**

&gt; &quot;Doesn't sit right.&quot;

---

You blink.

&gt; &quot;Well, yeah. That's the plan.&quot;

She looks away.

&gt; &quot;You stood between us and Crocodile's jaws.  
Saved the Straw Hats.  
Saved Vivi.  
And now that it's messy and *bigger than expected*, you're just going to vanish off the nearest liner?&quot;

Her tone shifts, ever so slightly.

&gt; &quot;Just feels like we used you.  
And now we're gonna lose you.&quot;

---

There's silence for a moment-nothing but the **sound of the skiff's sails snapping**, the **grind of sand under hull**, and the distant **rush of the Sandora River drawing closer.**

She doesn't look at you again.

She just stares forward, jaw tight.

Waiting.

---

**You have a window to respond.**  
What do you say or do?

&gt;&gt; USER: I get confused.

Erm? What? What do you mean?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Nearing the Sandora | Scene: Misunderstood Guilt]**  
**Tone: Hesitant Vulnerability | Mood: Confusion, Cracks in the Armor**

---

You blink, frown, and tilt your head at her-honestly confused.

&gt; &quot;Erm? What? What do you mean?&quot;

You were ready for worry about Smoker.  
Maybe a passing jab about the way you aim your juice.  
Not... this.

Not that tone.

Tashigi's eyes flick toward you.  
Then away again.

She exhales, shoulders falling slightly-like something slipped loose in her spine.

---

&gt; &quot;I mean...&quot;

Her fingers tap the hilt of her sword.

&gt; &quot;You went *all in*. You didn't hesitate. You got covered in juice, clawed through a Warlord's deathtrap, nearly got eaten-*twice*-and you never once acted like it wasn't your responsibility.&quot;

She finally turns her head to you, brows furrowed-not in anger, but in something that looks a little like **disappointment**.

&gt; &quot;And now you're saying it didn't mean anything? That you're leaving the second it's safe?&quot;

She shakes her head slightly.

&gt; &quot;I just... didn't expect that from you.&quot;

Her voice lowers.

&gt; &quot;And maybe I was wrong.&quot;

---

She doesn't look at you for a reaction.  
Doesn't ask anything outright.  
But her hands are trembling slightly on the rudder crank.

She's not just upset about Smoker.  
She's not just upset about you leaving.

She's wondering if she misjudged you.

And for someone like her?

That *hurts.*

---

**You have the floor.**  
You can backpedal.  
You can stand firm.  
You can confess.  
You can laugh it off.

How does Eatone Cheng answer this moment?

&gt;&gt; USER: I chuckle nervously. H-hey, I think i've survived plenty of near-death warlord encounters for one vacation. I'm no plucky princess or super marine. I'm just a guy. What difference would I really make?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Sandora River Winds | Scene: The Self-Deprecating Truth]**  
**Tone: Nervous Honesty | Mood: Cracked Armor, Misunderstood Modesty**

---

You chuckle-*nervously*, soft, like you're half-joking, half-deflecting.

&gt; &quot;H-hey... I think I've survived plenty of near-death Warlord encounters for *one* vacation, alright?&quot;

You rub the back of your head, glancing away with a sheepish smirk.

&gt; &quot;I'm no plucky princess, or super Marine. I'm just a guy. Just a-what'd I say? Full-time kiwi juice man?&quot;

You gesture vaguely at yourself, still splattered with traces of pulp and citrus stains.

&gt; &quot;What difference would I really make?&quot;

---

Tashigi doesn't answer immediately.

Not with words.

Just a long stare, as if she's reading you more than listening to you.

---

&gt; &quot;You know...&quot;

Her voice is calm now. Quiet.

&gt; &quot;That's the exact kind of thing Smoker would *hate* to hear.&quot;

You blink. She continues, eyes forward again.

&gt; &quot;He always says the most dangerous people in the world are the ones who think they *don't matter.*  
Because they fight like they've got nothing to lose.  
Because they throw themselves in for people who don't expect it.  
Because they *surprise everyone.*&quot;

She looks at you again.

&gt; &quot;You surprised all of us.&quot;

---

Behind you, wind whips against the canvas. The **Sandora River glimmers on the horizon**, a massive, winding slash of water that separates the desert from the capital beyond.

You're almost there.

Almost at the heart of the war.  
Almost at the place where your *vacation* ends, one way or another.

---

Tashigi glances at you one last time.

&gt; &quot;You say you're just a guy.  
But if you hadn't been there, there'd be six graves under Rain Dinners.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;So... just know that. Before you vanish.&quot;

---

She says nothing else.  
Returns to steering the skiff.

But she said enough.

---

**You've made an impression.  
Whether you stay or not-she won't forget what you did.  
And neither will you.**

The dunes begin to flatten. The water grows closer.  
You hear a distant *boom*.

Baroque Works is coming.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Go to Vivi. The time to plan for Alubarna is now. She'll know where to start.}  
2. {Scout the horizon. You heard that explosion-Baroque agents may already be ahead.}  
3. {Sit beside Tashigi again. Say nothing. Just stay a moment longer.}  
4. {Crack a joke. Cut the tension before it hardens.}  
5. {Ready your weapon. You're not running yet. Not if they still need you.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC - Vivi may choose to join in the conversation.

I stare awkwardly at Tashigi, not expecting her response.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Approaching the Sandora | Scene: Words That Linger]**  
**Tone: Emotional Tension | Mood: Quiet Shock, Mutual Recognition**

---

You stare at her.

Awkward. Caught off guard.

Tashigi doesn't meet your eyes again. Not after that.  
She just grips the rudder and keeps her gaze forward-like that whole confession didn't just happen, like she didn't just lay bare how much you've shaken her idea of what a &quot;civilian&quot; can be.

You don't know what to say.

You've faced **Warlords**, **Banana Gators**, and **piles of bureaucratic paperwork back at the school**. But this?  
Someone telling you that *you mattered?*

&gt; That's harder to deflect than a punch.

---

You're still stuck in that moment when **Vivi's voice cuts gently through the wind.**

She steps quietly to your side, her expression soft, gaze forward-toward the capital she's fighting to save, but her voice entirely focused on you.

&gt; &quot;You said you're just a guy.&quot;

She pauses.

&gt; &quot;But you were one of the first people in that casino who treated me like someone *worth protecting*, not someone to use or control.&quot;

She smiles faintly, the corners of her mouth twitching upward-but there's sadness there.

&gt; &quot;I've been a princess my whole life. I've had soldiers, guards, advisors... and a *lot* of pirates lately.&quot;

She glances between you and Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;But it was a *schoolteacher*, covered in juice, who stood in front of a Warlord and helped pull me out of a cage.&quot;

She gives a small nod, polite, but sincere.

&gt; &quot;I don't think there's anything âjust' about that.&quot;

---

You are now officially at **peak emotional disarmament**.

Two strong women-one a Marine, one a royal-just told you the same thing:

&gt; You made a difference.

And your plans to vanish?

They're starting to feel a little **less clean.**

---

Tashigi still doesn't say anything.  
But from the corner of your eye, you see her glance your way again.

She didn't expect Vivi to say that.

And now she's *definitely* waiting to hear what you say next.

---

**You have the floor again.**  
What do you say, Cheng?

&gt;&gt; USER: Princess, I... You got the Marines (I gesture at Tashigi). The royal army (I gesture at the horizon). And apparently, the pir- (I glance at the snoring Luffy), nevermind. I'm just a wrong vacationer in the right time. I think your impression of me might be a little... High.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Skiff - Heart of the Sandstorm]**  
**Tone: Deflection and Doubt | Mood: Humble Heart, Cracks Showing Through**

---

&gt; &quot;Princess, I...&quot;

You start, hand lifting a little uncertainly, caught between gratitude and guilt.

&gt; &quot;You've got the Marines,&quot;  
You gesture at Tashigi, who doesn't blink, just watches.  
&gt; &quot;The royal army...&quot;  
You wave toward the hazy horizon-where somewhere, **Koza** is marching with a fury stoked by lies.  
&gt; &quot;And apparently the pir-&quot;

Your eyes drift to **Luffy**, dead asleep with his hat over his face, drooling into his collarbone like a melted wax statue of chaos.

&gt; &quot;Nevermind.&quot;

That gets a small breath of laughter from **Vivi**, more exhale than sound-but real.

---

You shrug, quietly.

&gt; &quot;I'm just a wrong vacationer in the right time.&quot;

Then you glance at her.  
At both of them.

&gt; &quot;I think your impression of me might be a little... high.&quot;

---

**Vivi** looks at you-longer this time. Searching. The way a princess has to evaluate generals. Or strangers who became shields.

&gt; &quot;You know,&quot; she says gently, &quot;my father always told me...  
that the people who change the course of wars the most are the ones who *don't want to be there.*&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;They fight *only* because it's right.  
And when it's over, they walk away.&quot;

She shrugs, smile turning wistful.

&gt; &quot;But people like that never really vanish. They just... show up again when the next storm hits.&quot;

---

Tashigi doesn't speak, but she exhales slowly-eyes closing for a second, like some tiny part of her tension just loosened.

Not all.

But enough.

---

Then-

&gt; **BOOM.**

Far ahead, across the rolling dunes, a column of **smoke and sand erupts upward**, followed by the distant thunder of **hoofbeats** and the glint of **steel catching sun**.

The Sandora River glimmers in the foreground.

And now you can see them.

**Baroque Works**.

They're here.

And **they're ahead of you**.

---

**OOC Update:**

- Emotional tension: Softened. You remain humble, but their belief in you has *crystallized*.  
- Vivi and Tashigi see you for what you are: **unwilling, unrelenting, undeniably part of the fight.**  
- You have now approached the **Sandora River crossing**-the narrow point before the final sprint to **Alubarna**.  
- **Baroque agents** are waiting across the far bank. Possibly Mr. 2. Possibly worse.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Draw your baton. &quot;Guess it's showtime again.&quot;}  
2. {Glance at Tashigi. &quot;Still think I'm just a tourist?&quot;}  
3. {Walk to the bow and scout the enemy. Let the moment pass.}  
4. {Crack your knuckles. &quot;Okay. Let's ruin some bounty hunter careers.&quot;}  
5. {Stay still. Wait for the group to react first. This isn't your crew-but they're counting on you.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Oh dear. Move protectively in front of Vivi, scanning for snipers. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skiff - On the Edge of Ambush]**  
**Tone: Quiet Instinct | Mood: Protector Mode Engaged**

---

&gt; *Boom.*  
&gt; *Smoke.*  
&gt; *Glint of steel.*

And before anyone can speak, you **move.**

A practiced step forward-nothing dramatic, nothing shouted-just calm, immediate **protectiveness**.

You place yourself **between Vivi and the distant chaos**, eyes narrowing as you scan the dunes across the river.

Not for soldiers.

&gt; For snipers.

---

**Your eyes flick from ridge to ridge**, watching for the shimmer of a scope, the silhouette of a crouched figure. A telltale **glint**, a hint of **barrel** in shadow, a ridge of **kicking up sand** with no wind-

Nothing yet.

But this reeks of a trap.

And *you've taught enough kids to know* when someone is trying to pick off the smart ones first.

&gt; You don't say anything to Vivi.  
Just stand there.  
Just watch.

**She notices.**

Doesn't speak.  
But her hand brushes lightly against your coat as she steps subtly behind you.

---

**Tashigi** catches your movement. She tightens her grip on her sword and nods silently, sliding sideways to cover your flank.

**Zoro** squints ahead. &quot;They're not just waiting. They're *hunting.*&quot;

**Nami** curses under her breath. &quot;If they've already crossed, the river's not a barrier-it's bait.&quot;

**Luffy** still sleeps. For now.

---

Across the Sandora, **dust kicks up** again.

Figures are **moving. Approaching. Dispersing.**

The shapes are too far to make out-yet.

But they're spreading in formation.

&gt; Baroque Works has **set the field.**

---

**OOC Tactical Summary:**

- You've instinctively placed yourself in a **bodyguard role** for Vivi.  
- There is **no confirmed sniper**, but the terrain is optimal for one.  
- Baroque Works agents are deploying across the far bank of the river.  
- Sandora crossing will be a **battlefield**-no stealth, no smooth passage.  
- Tashigi, Zoro, Nami, and others are now aware of the looming fight.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Crouch, squint, and trace possible sniper angles. Call them out for the crew.}  
2. {Quietly ask Vivi if she can identify any of the agents by posture or clothing.}  
3. {Signal Tashigi to stay close to Vivi-you prepare to break away and flank.}  
4. {Wait, baton ready. The first move isn't yours-it's theirs. You're a counterpuncher.}  
5. {Tell the crew: &quot;River's the choke point. They want us *here*. We don't give them what they want.&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4

OOC: I don't know Vivi's backstory, or her infiltration of baroque works. All I know is that she's trying to save her country from crocodile. By herself for some reason. Does she even have bodyguards?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skiff - Suspicion on the Sand]**  
**Tone: Quiet Focus | Mood: Battle Readiness &amp; Background Curiosity**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You assume a low, defensive posture, baton held loose but ready-watchful. And with that stillness comes a flicker of *curiosity* about the young woman behind you...**

---

You crouch slightly, **center of gravity low**, baton held loose but firm in your hand, tip pointed toward the sand as if it might flick forward with a whisper and crack a skull open like an overripe melon.

&gt; The juice?  
Settling along your shoulders now-ready to launch. You feel the familiar tingle in your fingertips.

But you wait.

&gt; *Let them make the first mistake.*

---

You don't blink. Don't breathe hard. You just **watch.**

Because you're a counterpuncher.  
And nothing deserves a harder counter than a group of smug suits hiding in the dust, **trying to take a princess' head off in broad daylight.**

---

But as the wind picks up and the horizon remains still just a moment longer-you find yourself frowning slightly. Not from danger.

From **thought**.

You shift your weight, glance over your shoulder for just a beat at **Vivi**-standing upright, staring toward the chaos, completely composed for a girl her age.

No armor.  
No guards.  
No entourage.

Just **her.**

&gt; *Wait...  
She's royalty.*  
Why the hell doesn't she have a *platoon* flanking her right now?

You don't know the details-didn't catch much more than &quot;princess&quot; and &quot;civil war&quot; in the heat of the escape.

But she seems to be the *only one* from the kingdom fighting to stop this madness **from the inside.**

And she doesn't wear that like a martyr.

She wears it like it's **normal.**

---

It makes no sense.

Unless...

&gt; She *chose* to come alone.

---

Behind you, **Vivi remains silent**. But her hand gently tightens around the folds of her cloak.

She knows you're thinking.  
And maybe, quietly, she's glad you are.

---

**OOC Insight Check:**  
- You do **not** know about Vivi's infiltration of Baroque Works as Miss Wednesday.  
- You do **not** know that she and Igaram entered undercover nearly a year ago.  
- All you've seen is a girl throwing herself into chaos with **no visible security detail** and **no royal backup.**

**The question of &quot;Why is she alone?&quot; is now fully seeded in Eatone's mind.**

---

The river is near. The enemy approaches.

**Baroque Works is about to make its move.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Keep your eyes forward. Ask Vivi quietly: &quot;You really come out here with no guards?&quot;}  
2. {Hold position and whisper to Tashigi, &quot;You ever find it odd there's *no* escort for a royal?&quot;}  
3. {Let it go. For now. Focus on the battle forming. The question can wait.}  
4. {Take charge: quietly direct the crew into formation. If this is an ambush, you'll spring it.}  
5. {Whisper to Vivi: &quot;When this is over... you and I are gonna have a long conversation.&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I'll figure it out later. For now, survive. For later, exfiltrate from Alabasta.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skiff - The Calm Before the Clash]**  
**Tone: Focused Survival | Mood: Tactical Silence, Deferred Questions**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You shelve your questions. No time to dig into the mystery of a lone royal. The battlefield is forming-and survival always comes first.**

---

You tuck the thought away.

&gt; *A princess. No guard. No backup. No kingdom behind her.  
Weird.*  
But not *now.*

&gt; *Now's for surviving.  
Later's for exfiltration.*

You tighten your grip on your baton.  
Juice simmers at your fingertips-cool, acidic, waiting. You can feel your internal reservoir responding to the tension. Pressure. Heat. Anticipation.

This desert's about to crack wide open.

---

Ahead, the **Sandora River** winds like a golden serpent, glimmering under the sun.

On the far bank, **Baroque Works agents** are moving into full visibility now.

- One spins dramatically in a long feathered coat-**Mr. 2, Bon Clay.**  
- Others flank behind him, a half-dozen **uniformed, grinning, knife-twirling professionals**.  
- Something **large and hulking** stomps into view behind a dune. Possibly **Mr. 4's** dog-powered bazooka unit.

They've turned the crossing into a **stage**.

And you?

You're not their star.

&gt; But you're the surprise act that ruins the finale.

---

**Zoro grips his swords.  
Tashigi's stance shifts-low and tight.  
Nami grips her clima-tact.  
Vivi narrows her eyes.**

Even **Luffy** is sitting up now, hair wind-whipped, staring across the river.

His smile isn't wide yet.

But it's coming.

---

**Baroque Works is ready.  
And so are you.**

---

**OOC: Combat imminent.  
This next event will be a skirmish at the Sandora River crossing, with Baroque agents engaging in an attempt to **halt the crew's approach to Alubarna**.  
You are at full readiness. Your role in the fight is yours to define.**

---

**Do you want to:**

1. {Take first strike. Preemptively fire a juice burst at Bon Clay-maybe interrupt his dance monologue.}  
2. {Wait for them to engage. You're the counter. You hit hardest when they don't see it coming.}  
3. {Whisper to Vivi: &quot;Get low and stay behind me.&quot; You're still shielding.}  
4. {Call out to Tashigi: &quot;We hit hard and fast. You and me, flank wide.&quot;}  
5. {Try to pull Baroque agents into a trap-juice-lined sand. Slip, stick, slam. Classic.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Alright Blue. Stay close. I'll let the others engage the enemy.

OOC: Current devil fruit abilities of note:
- conjure and control kiwi juice, of slightly varying thickness, sourness, and sweetness.
- mist an area with kiwi vapors, enhanced senses by feeling the movement of the mist.
- more to come soon

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Skirmish Commencing]**  
**Tone: Quiet Control | Mood: The Calm Within the Chaos**

---

The wind howls over the sand.  
The river glimmers.  
And the enemy **poses.**

But while the Straw Hats shift into battle stances and tension coils across the deck like a drawn bow-

You don't move forward.

You move *back*.

&gt; You glance at Vivi, give her a quick once-over-she's poised, tense, but visibly uncertain in the face of a full-fledged ambush.

You murmur low, just for her.

&gt; &quot;Alright, Blue. Stay close.&quot;

She blinks at the nickname-then nods once, clutching her cloak tighter and sliding a little nearer to your side.

&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot;

You plant your feet wide, baton still unextended but loose in your hand, the first **hiss of juice vapor** swirling out from your fingertips like steam off a kettle.

---

**OOC: Kiwi Mist Active.**

- *You generate a low, thin cloud of citrus vapor-nearly invisible in daylight but clings to the ankles and knees of those nearby.*
- *As it spreads, you feel movement through the mist. Vibrations. Shifts. Footsteps. Sweeps of weapons.*
- *You gain enhanced localized awareness within a ~15 ft radius.*

You breathe deep.

&gt; That's Zoro, moving forward.  
&gt; That's Tashigi's foot sliding wide-**she's flanking left.**  
&gt; That's Luffy leaping-he's gonna break right.

And behind you?

&gt; Vivi. Steady.  
Not fleeing. Not panicking.  
Just trusting.

Across the river:

**Mr. 2 Bon Clay** finishes his twirl and flings one long leg out like a ballerina with vengeance issues.

&gt; &quot;So you've come to dance with Baroque Works at the *River of Rebellion*! Shall we begin the opening act?!&quot;

A **snap of fingers**.  
Agents charge.

You don't move.

&gt; You're the wall.  
&gt; You're the mist.  
&gt; You're the **goddamn substitute teacher who stayed late on a war day.**

---

**OOC Summary:**

- Vivi is behind you and under your protection.  
- Kiwi mist is active, giving you early warning of close-range threats.  
- You've taken the defensive/support position, allowing the Straw Hats to hit first.

---

**Incoming combat scenario.**

First enemy-**Baroque Works footsoldier**-approaching fast. Low, fast runner. Knife drawn. You feel him hit the edge of your mist field.

**What do you do?**

1. {Juice-thicken the mist directly beneath his feet-trip him. Classic slapstick takedown.}  
2. {Baton out, intercept him with a precise, non-lethal Seastone jab. You're still professional.}  
3. {Let him pass-your priority is Vivi. Strike only if he closes.}  
4. {Blast a stream of sour juice straight into his face from behind the mist. Ocular warfare.}  
5. {Redirect the mist-make it swirl around *another* target. You're hunting someone bigger.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Give him the good ol' one two. Yell at Bon Clay. Hey! You're the guy from earlier! You're one of Crocodile's bastards?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Mist &amp; Motion | Combat Begins]**  
**Tone: Sharp and Tactical | Mood: Teacher Mode: Unleashed**  
**ð² Combat Roll - (Eatone +2 Baton Technique, +1 Mist Awareness, +1 Initiative Read) = Result: 8 [Legendary]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: You intercept the attacker *before he even sees you*, land a **precision baton strike to the temple**, and drop him flat in the sand-**consciousness optional**.**

---

The first footfall enters your mist field-**you feel it** more than see it.

A shift in pressure.  
A ripple in the juice.  
A weight *right where it shouldn't be.*

Your baton **snaps out** from your side in a perfect arc, Seastone tip glinting just once as it extends *mid-motion*.

&gt; *CRACK!*

You don't even need to look.

The Baroque agent crumples mid-step, flipping heel over head and landing with a soft *whump* in the sand beside the skiff.  
Out cold.  
Not dead.  
**Efficient. Clean. Professional.**

---

Then you raise your voice, eyes now locked on the **dancing silhouette** on the far riverbank.

&gt; &quot;HEY! You're that guy from earlier!&quot;

**Mr. 2 Bon Clay**, mid spin, freezes mid-dramatic pirouette.

He squints.

&gt; &quot;The *pineapple-looking one* from the bar?!&quot;

You point your baton squarely at him.

&gt; &quot;You're *one of Crocodile's bastards*?&quot;

A sharp gasp escapes him.  
He dramatically recoils, hand on chest.

&gt; &quot;*BASTARD?!*  
How *dare* you! I am **Mr. 2 Bon Clay**, Queen of the Kick Line, Assassin Extraordinaire, and possibly the **most expressive** man on this battlefield!&quot;

A pause.

Then he straightens, fans fluttering.

&gt; &quot;But yes. Also that.&quot;

---

Around you, battle breaks:

- **Zoro** meets two agents in a whirlwind of steel.  
- **Tashigi** is already locked with a large hammer-wielding brute-swords clashing in hot, dry arcs.  
- **Nami** has begun her weather pattern build-up.  
- **Luffy**, now fully awake, lets out a rubbery *crack* as he rockets toward the river's edge.  
- **Chopper** has transformed-**Guard Point.** He's shielding **Usopp**, who is behind a crate building something that **definitely explodes.**

And you?

Still in front of **Vivi**.  
Still calm.  
Mist curling around your legs like a loyal animal.

---

**Bon Clay's eyes lock onto you.**

&gt; &quot;Oh ho~ You want to dance *with me*?! Come then, JUICE-MAN! I shall show you the footwork of DEATH~!&quot;

He leaps-**straight toward your position.**

---

**OOC:**  
Bon Clay is coming in fast. His fighting style involves **taijutsu**, high kicks, and **Clone-Clone Fruit transformation**-which you are **not aware of yet**.

**He's targeting you now.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Mist surge-blind his approach, thicken the air, then *crack him mid-spin*.}  
2. {Baton up-pure melee. Let's see if dance-fu beats substitute teacher smackdown.}  
3. {Hold him off, lure him into the mist deeper. You'll counter when he loses his footing.}  
4. {Warn Vivi-&quot;If he gets through, *run*. I'll catch up.&quot;}  
5. {Switch tactics. Spray a wide acidic burst midair to throw off his rhythm and force a crash landing.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Oh shit! Why me?! 

I call out! Oi! Need some help here, got a priority baddy on me!

Option 4 / 5 - Will a more acidic spray at Bon Clay. It seems to be greener than usual. Odd.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora Skirmish - Dance vs. Juice]**  
**Tone: Rising Panic, Improvised Precision | Mood: Dancer Meets Deluge**  
**ð² Acidic Spray Roll - (Eatone +2 Fruit Power, +1 Desperation, +1 Focused Aim) = Result: 6 [Great]**  
**ð² Bon Clay Evasion Roll - (+2 Acrobatics, -1 Overconfidence, -1 Unfamiliarity with Fruit) = Result: 2 [Fair]**  
**â Outcome: Bon Clay eats a faceful of *acid-green citrus spray*, is **blinded mid-leap**, and crashes *spectacularly* into the sand-twirling, flailing, shrieking. You've *partially neutralized* a major threat. For now.**

---

&gt; &quot;*OH SHIT! WHY ME?!*&quot;

You skid back half a step, eyes wide as Bon Clay launches like a **screaming glitter missile of ballet-fueled murder**, foot extended high and fan fluttering like a death flag.

&gt; &quot;Oi! Need some help here! Got a *priority baddy* on me!&quot;

You don't wait for an answer.  
Instead, you yank your arm forward, palm up, and **will it.**

&gt; *PFTSSSSHHHHH-!*

A pressurized jet of kiwi juice-**sharper, more acidic**, and **noticeably greener** than anything you've produced before-bursts from your palm in a twisting arc.

It *hisses* in the air like a venomous vine.

Bon Clay sees it too late.

&gt; &quot;-My eyes! MY FABULOUS EYES-*AGH!*&quot;

His leap turns into a **pirouetting crash**, body flailing sideways into the sand like a sabotaged stage prop.

He hits the ground spinning and screaming, tumbling into one of his own agents.

&gt; &quot;*I'm blind with flavor!!*&quot;

---

You blink, staring at the trail of juice still steaming in the air.

It's **thicker** than your usual spray.  
And more **acidic**-clearly by your will, but... *sharper than expected*.  
Almost **vibrant**, like your power's *listening harder* now.

&gt; *That's new.*

Vivi, behind you, leans around with wide eyes.

&gt; &quot;Was that-supposed to be *that* strong?&quot;

You don't even answer. You're too busy watching Bon Clay flail, trying to regain dignity in a puddle of sand and kiwi.

---

From the side, **Zoro** snorts.

&gt; &quot;Nice shot, pineapple.&quot;

---

**Bon Clay is not defeated, but temporarily disabled.**  
He'll recover soon-but now he knows **you're dangerous.**  
The battlefield shifts in your favor.

---

**OOC:**
- New evolution unlocked: **Acid Control** - With intent, Eatone can vary the *acidic potency* of his juice attacks.  
- Strength, color, and flavor now respond more dynamically to emotion and need.  
- Bon Clay has been neutralized long enough to shift focus or reposition.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Press the advantage-go in with baton and finish the fight before he recovers.}  
2. {Help another crew member while Bon Clay's down. Spread the support.}  
3. {Turn to Vivi. &quot;Still good back there?&quot; Reaffirm your guard role.}  
4. {Ask Tashigi-&quot;Wanna help me *curbstomp a ballerina?*&quot;}  
5. {Observe Bon Clay closely. That face-changing thing might come next...}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Gah, I need to keep him down!  I prepare another glob of juice, willing it to be stickier. It turns yellowish. Doubly odd.

(OOC: this is the most life and death Eatone has ever faced. Precious bounties often involved small time bandits or weak pirates. Not a grand line warlord and his criminal syndicate)

Option 3 - Looks like no backup is forthcoming, the others are engaged. You able to fight, blue?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Stick, Don't Slip]**  
**Tone: Desperate Focus | Mood: Evolution Under Pressure**

---

&gt; *Gah-I need to keep him down!*

Your hand trembles slightly as you call more juice to the surface.  
Not just **more**-but *different*.

&gt; &quot;Stickier,&quot; you mutter under your breath. &quot;I need this bastard *grounded.*&quot;

It comes willingly.

A **glob** of kiwi concentrate, thicker than jam and slightly **yellowish**, oozes across your palm with a viscosity you haven't summoned before.

&gt; *This... isn't just juice. This is control.*

You feel it now-your Devil Fruit is **responding to stress, to survival**, to your *need* to protect.

---

Bon Clay is already trying to recover.

&gt; &quot;*You cowardly cocktail!*&quot;  
He stumbles upright, blinded but dramatically posturing again.  
&gt; &quot;*I shall unleash my encore-!*&quot;

You don't give him the chance.

With a flick of your wrist, you hurl the sticky glob with precision.

&gt; *SPLAT!*

Right into his **leg and hip**.

He slams to the ground with a shriek of dramatic betrayal, one leg **glued to the sand**, the other flailing wildly like a panicked flamingo in a dance-off against gravity.

&gt; &quot;*I CAN'T MOVE! WHO TRAPS A DANCER'S LEG?!*&quot;

---

But even as he writhes, the battle rages around you.

You glance over your shoulder.

&gt; **Zoro** is toe-to-toe with Mr. 1 now-blades sparking like lightning against iron.  
&gt; **Nami** has conjured cloud cover. Thunder rumbles above.  
&gt; **Luffy** is locked in a headbutt war with a Baroque enforcer shaped like a hay bale.  
&gt; **Tashigi** is holding her own-but she's wounded.  
&gt; **Chopper's Guard Point** is under pressure.  
&gt; **Usopp's screaming. That's normal.**

No one's coming to help.

---

You turn to **Vivi**.

&gt; &quot;You able to fight, Blue?&quot;

She startles slightly at the question.

&gt; &quot;I-yes. I've trained. I'm not just here to hide.&quot;

She reaches beneath her cloak and draws two slender **peacock-slashers**-steel-bladed rings strung with retractable wires.

Her stance isn't perfect.

But it's **determined.**

&gt; &quot;Just tell me who. And when.&quot;

---

**OOC Ability Note:**
- New sub-manifestation unlocked: **Stickiness Control.** You can now manipulate **adhesive properties** of your juice.  
- The **yellowish tone** appears to correspond with this trait.  
- You're under real life-and-death pressure now-and your Fruit is evolving as you adapt.

---

**Bon Clay is currently stuck, blinded, flailing.  
Vivi is at your side.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Together, you and Vivi move in to finish Bon Clay before he recovers.}  
2. {Tell Vivi to hold the line-then break off to help Tashigi or another ally.}  
3. {Keep Vivi guarded. Don't engage until Bon Clay tries to transform-you're watching for it.}  
4. {Start controlling battlefield space-layer sticky and slippery zones for control.}  
5. {Encourage Vivi to strike first. Test her readiness. Watch her back.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Can't go finish Bon Clay off, I'd be leaving Vivi unguarded.

I lick a bit of the yellower juice left on my fingertips. Huh. Sweet. Squint.

Is this... Like... Sweet golden kiwis vs tart green kiwis? What the heck?!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Kiwi Awakening]**  
**Tone: Tactical Pause | Mood: Confused Discoveries Under Fire**

---

Bon Clay is still flailing in the sand, **dramatically trapped**, and crying out like he's performing to an invisible opera house.

&gt; &quot;*This is a CRIME AGAINST PERFORMANCE ART-*!&quot;

You don't flinch.

You don't move.

&gt; Because **Vivi's behind you**.

And no matter how tempting it is to walk over and beat that man into a sticky citrus pancake, you're not letting her get blindsided while you showboat.

---

You hold position. **Eyes forward. Juice ready.**  
Bon Clay isn't out of tricks yet. You've seen the flair, but not the **Devil Fruit**-and *something* tells you he's not done.

---

As the sticky mist drips from your fingers, you absently swipe your thumb across your palm and bring it to your tongue-

Just a taste.

&gt; *Sweet.*

Your brow furrows.

You glance at the faint **yellow smear** still coating your skin.

&gt; &quot;Huh...&quot;

You squint at the glob still sticking Bon Clay's leg to the sand.

It's glistening slightly **golden.**

&gt; *This isn't the usual green...*

You look to the earlier splotch from the acidic blast-

**Bright green. Sharp. Sour.**

But *this*?  
This is **sweeter**, richer, with a honeyed aftertaste.

---

You blink, trying to process what your instincts already know.

&gt; **Golden kiwis.**  
Not just sweet, but **different in effect**.  
Your body isn't just manipulating juice.

It's calling on different **types**.

And possibly different **properties.**

---

&gt; *&quot;Green for sour, sharp, acidic...&quot;*  
&gt; *&quot;Gold for sticky, sweet... adhesive?&quot;*

You're not just conjuring kiwi juice anymore.  
You're **selecting varietals**.

Like a goddamn fruit sommelier of violence.

---

**Vivi notices your squint.**  
&gt; &quot;Something wrong?&quot;

You murmur:

&gt; &quot;I think I've been using this fruit like a faucet.  
Turns out it's more like a... juice bar.&quot;

She doesn't understand the metaphor.

But she does grin a little.

&gt; &quot;You're weird.&quot;

---

Bon Clay lets out a screech.

&gt; &quot;*And now my eyes are back! I SEE YOU, JUICE KNAVE! I-OH NO WAIT I'M STILL STUCK-*&quot;

---

**OOC Update:**

You now understand your Devil Fruit has **distinct kiwi variants** with unique traits.

- **Green Kiwi**: Tart, acidic, reactive. Sharp burst attacks and mist.
- **Golden Kiwi**: Sweet, thick, adhesive. Trapping and binding.
- More varietals may emerge based on **emotional state**, **intention**, or **environmental stimuli**.

---

**You are holding the line. Vivi's safe. Bon Clay is immobilized (for now).**

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Prep a second layer of golden kiwi to restrain him further if he tries to transform.}  
2. {Test your control-try conjuring a different effect on purpose. Think &quot;cooling&quot; or &quot;stinging.&quot;}  
3. {Quietly tell Vivi to ready her weapons-you'll give her the opening if Bon Clay breaks free.}  
4. {Call out to the crew: &quot;Bon's stuck! Someone take him out!&quot;}  
5. {Keep watching. Still and ready. You're not taking your eye off this freak for a second.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - Oi, someone get the pink guy! I get a little closer to Vivi

OOC: the others are still fully engaged. Some may be faltering.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Tactical Yelling]**  
**Tone: Controlled Panic | Mood: Guarded, Under Pressure**

---

You hold your ground-juice at the ready, baton steady-but your eye flicks to the side.

&gt; **Bon Clay's not down for long.**  
The man is many things-loud, dramatic, unnerving-but above all?  
**Resilient.**

You raise your voice, slicing through the cacophony of sand, steel, and chaos.

&gt; &quot;*OI! Someone get the pink guy!*&quot;

Your voice cracks like a school bell through a brawl.

---

But the response?

None.

- **Zoro's bleeding.**  
Fighting **Mr. 1**, and his blades aren't biting.  
- **Tashigi's backpedaling**, her shoulder cut-her blade catching, but her footing slipping.  
- **Luffy's mid-air**-fist drawn, roaring at some poor Baroque freak who looks like a potato with legs.  
- **Nami** is summoning lightning-but she's surrounded by two agents closing fast.  
- **Chopper** is shielding **Usopp**, who's now wildly yelling about &quot;Phase Three of the Sniper King Plan.&quot;

&gt; **Nobody's free.**

---

You glance back at **Vivi**.  
Her hands grip her peacock slashers tightly-knuckles white, jaw set.

You step a little closer to her.

&gt; &quot;Stay tight, Blue.&quot;

She nods. Not afraid.  
Focused.

---

Bon Clay, eyes cleared now, snarls with dignity.

&gt; &quot;**HOW RUDE.**  
Is it so hard to offer a man a little *dramatic stage time* before he's blasted again?!&quot;

He pulls one hand to his face-  
And suddenly, with a *wet slap*, **his features change.**

**Clone-Clone Fruit activated.**

In a moment, he looks **exactly like Tashigi.**

&gt; &quot;Let's see how YOU like beating up a sweet young Marine girl!&quot;

---

**OOC Alert:**

Bon Clay is now using the powers of the **Mane Mane no Mi (Clone-Clone Fruit).**  
He can copy any person he touches-**voice, body, face, everything.**  
He's copied Tashigi.

Vivi, behind you, gasps-but doesn't move.

&gt; &quot;That's not her,&quot; she says. &quot;She's still there-left side. But... gods, it's uncanny.&quot;

---

**You are up. He's still stuck, but preparing something.  
You've stepped closer to Vivi. No allies are coming. Not yet.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Taunt him: &quot;I've hit Tashigi before. Didn't stop her. Won't stop me.&quot; Slam him again.}  
2. {Try to manipulate juice into his mouth/nose-drown his clone disguise with golden gunk.}  
3. {Ask Vivi quietly: &quot;You ever sparred a fake Marine before?&quot; Prepare to fight together.}  
4. {Try to stall. Talk him down. Maybe he likes monologues. You can bait him longer.}  
5. {Use the juice mist to try and **mark the real Tashigi** subtly-keep track of fakes.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - his body may have entirely changed, but the misting pattern on his clothes is different. It won't work on me, probably.

Also.. I grimace. Does it clone things... Down there?

I quickly turn back to Vivi. Please don't listen to this, blue.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Identity Crisis and Unwanted Imagery]**  
**Tone: Hyper-Aware | Mood: Tactical Focus, Inappropriate Thoughts at High Speed**  
**ð¯ Result: You maintain full awareness of Bon Clay despite the disguise. Your mist-subtle, tactile, and already in place-**betrays the truth his appearance tries to hide.**  
Also, you accidentally traumatize Vivi for approximately 1.3 seconds.**

---

Bon Clay-now **Tashigi-shaped**-poses dramatically, one hand on a hip he didn't earn, lips pursed into a smug, perfect pout.

&gt; &quot;*Now you face a true moral dilemma, pineapple man! Will you strike a lady? Can you best the elegant blade of Justice?!*&quot;

You don't blink.

You don't buy it.

Because your **mist** is still curling along his body, dancing around his ankles, clinging slightly to the creases in his coat.

&gt; *Different folds.*  
&gt; *Different gait.*  
&gt; *Wrong damn center of balance.*

---

&gt; *Nice try.*

You shift your grip subtly on the baton-eyes scanning not just the shape but the **resistance** of your vapor.  
Clone or not, he **can't hide the texture.** The mist remembers more than a face.

You open your mouth to speak-  
Then blink.

Frown.

&gt; &quot;Wait-does that thing clone, uh... *everything?*&quot;

Your eyes widen in quiet panic.  
You grimace.

&gt; *Oh no.*

You glance over your shoulder at Vivi with dawning horror.

&gt; &quot;Please don't listen to this, Blue.&quot;

She, of course, *was* listening.  
And now she's frozen, mid-blink, clearly caught between **diplomatic detachment** and **psychological damage**.

&gt; &quot;...I will try not to imagine it.&quot;

---

Bon Clay/Tashigi gasps with exaggerated insult.

&gt; &quot;*Are you suggesting I would sully the sanctity of a lady's form with uncouth mimicry?!*  
*I am an artist, not a deviant!*&quot;

Then he immediately **winks**.

&gt; &quot;But yes.&quot;

---

Vivi quietly whispers, **&quot;I'm never unhearing that.&quot;**

---

**OOC Update:**

- Your mist field has proven to be a **countermeasure against visual deception.**  
- You are now aware that while Bon Clay can mimic physical appearances, he **cannot replicate internal sensory interactions.**  
- Your ability to **sense the real person through your mist** is now a **passive bonus** in fights against transformation-based foes.

---

**Bon Clay is preparing to break free of the stickiness.  
The clone form has bought him time.  
Vivi is trying not to look at either of you.**

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Strike now. Baton to the gut. He's still stuck and distracted.}  
2. {Cover him in golden juice again. Thicker. Don't let him move a damn inch.}  
3. {Let Vivi strike. &quot;Your call, princess. Wanna end him?&quot;}  
4. {Blind him again. Sour burst to the face. Turn that wink into a squint.}  
5. {Try to coordinate with Tashigi-have her flank while you keep him talking.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I prepare another golden orb for launch.

OOC: Meanwhile Tashigi notices herself, albeit with weird poses and expressions.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Juicy Justice: Round Three]**  
**Tone: Controlled Precision | Mood: Tactical Humiliation, Synchronized Smackdown**  
**ð² Golden Juice Launch - (Eatone +2 Fruit Control, +1 Focused Emotion, +1 Visual Targeting) = Result: 7 [Fantastic]**  
**ð¯ Outcome: Bon Clay is slammed with a second wave of **hyper-adhesive golden kiwi concentrate**, further locking down his limbs. Now both legs and one arm are glued to the ground. He is, in every sense, stuck being *extra*.**

---

You ignore the insults.  
The wink.  
The nightmarish philosophical implications of whether Devil Fruit cloning extends to...

&gt; *You know what? No.*

You inhale, square your stance, and call it again.

&gt; *Golden kiwi. Thick. Sticky. Shut-him-up consistency.*

Your palm pulses once-  
And a bright **golden orb** begins to swell and shimmer in your hand.  
Richer this time. **Heavier. Thicker.**  
Like caramelized citrus ready to be *weaponized.*

---

Bon Clay-as-Tashigi raises a fan in his free hand, still stuck mid-kick, striking a ridiculous pose as if *this was all part of the choreography.*

&gt; &quot;*Do your worst, fruit boy! I have suffered worse than this in the fires of interpretive dance!*&quot;

You don't answer.  
You just **let fly**.

&gt; *FWMP.*

The orb slams into his **upper chest**, immediately spreading into a *bright yellow goo web* that splashes across his arm, neck, and one side of his face.

He shrieks.

&gt; &quot;*MY EXTENSION RANGE! YOU MONSTER-MY LIMBS!*&quot;

---

Meanwhile, off to the side-

**Tashigi**, mid-slash against a scimitar-wielding agent, happens to glance toward the riverbank.

She **freezes for just a half-second**.

Because **there she is.**  
Or... someone that looks **exactly** like her.  
Flailing. Screaming.  
Mouth glued halfway open.

And **posing** like a drunken runway model.

She blinks.  
&gt; &quot;...The hell is-&quot;

Then sees **you** standing above the imitation with juice dripping from your outstretched hand.

Her eye twitches.

&gt; &quot;That *bastard's using my face.*&quot;

She **growls**, parries her attacker, and starts heading your way-**intent on reclaiming her dignity.**

---

**OOC Update:**

- Bon Clay is now **fully immobilized**-both legs and an arm **pinned to the ground** with golden kiwi glue.  
- He can still talk, but any action he takes will take a full round to break through.  
- **Tashigi** has noticed the clone and is now en route, adding extra danger to Bon Clay's day.  
- Your golden juice continues to evolve, reacting to your tactical needs.

---

**Vivi steps beside you, eyes narrowed.**

&gt; &quot;You're getting better at that.&quot;

You shrug modestly.

&gt; &quot;Practice makes... pulp.&quot;

She groans quietly.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Leave Bon Clay stuck-move to assist Tashigi or Zoro. You've done enough here.}  
2. {Coordinate with Tashigi-she deserves a swing. &quot;Hey Marine, wanna punch your own face?&quot;}  
3. {Keep a watchful eye on Bon Clay. He's slippery. Literally. You're not falling for a clone feint.}  
4. {Talk to Vivi-ask her how close Alubarna is, or what the next move is after this ambush.}  
5. {Taste the new juice. Does it have *flavor properties* too? You're in it now. Might as well understand.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Maintain protective vigil over Vivi. See if anyone needs help, though.

OOC: Who are the elite agents engaging us right now, from Canon?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Mid-Skirmish: Protective Vigil]**  
**Tone: Focused and Guarded | Mood: Protector Role Solidified**

---

You don't chase the victory.

Bon Clay may be writhing under a glorious citrus sarcophagus, and Tashigi may be storming over with murder in her eyes, but your **priority hasn't changed**.

You glance at Vivi.

Still beside you. Still alert. Still alive.

You resume your stance-mist low, juice primed, baton gripped-not gloating, not advancing, just **watching**.

Because you're not here to look cool.

You're here to make sure she **makes it to Alubarna**.

---

Your eyes flick around the battlefield, searching for those who might need backup-

- **Zoro** is locked with **Mr. 1 (Daz Bones)**. His steel body is proving difficult. The fight's intense, but balanced.
- **Nami** is fending off **Miss Doublefinger** with her clima-tact-weather forming, but she's getting pressed.
- **Usopp** is mostly hiding and lobbing explosives at footsoldiers.
- **Chopper** is supporting him in Guard Point, holding the line.
- **Tashigi** is wrapping up her scimitar opponent and closing in on Bon Clay-you assume it's going to be *very personal*.
- **Luffy** is finishing up a fight with a non-elite Baroque enforcer-he hasn't fought **Crocodile** yet, per the altered timeline.

---

**OOC: Canon Elite Agents Active in This Ambush:**  
The Baroque Works agents deployed at the Sandora crossing in canon (and present in your version of the arc):

- **Mr. 1 (Daz Bones)** - Engaged with Zoro. Supersharp steel body. Stoic, deadly.
- **Miss Doublefinger** - Engaged with Nami. Spiky-piercing body via the Spike-Spike Fruit.
- **Mr. 2 Bon Clay** - Immobilized by you. Likely to be defeated by Tashigi next.
- (Possibly) **Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas** - The bazooka dog and mole duo may appear *later* depending on how this fight resolves.
- Canonically, **Mr. 3** is elsewhere due to earlier events, unless modified.
- **Crocodile** himself is not present-he is in motion, headed for Alubarna with Robin.

---

**Current Tactical Note:**  
- **You are the only combatant not engaged in a direct fight**-this gives you options.  
- Your vigil over Vivi is still essential, but you can take shots, support allies, or direct the battlefield.  
- You are likely the best candidate for **reactive support** due to your ranged capabilities and sensory control.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Send a shot of acidic mist toward Miss Doublefinger-Nami's in real trouble.}  
2. {Whistle for Tashigi-let her have her moment with Bon Clay. &quot;He's yours.&quot;}  
3. {Call out to Vivi. &quot;Stay close, I might need to cover one of them.&quot;}  
4. {Layer sticky juice near Nami or Usopp. Slow the enemy down so they can recover.}  
5. {Continue observing. Ready to intercept if anyone approaches Vivi. Patience is power.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - You holding up okay, blue? I look at her worriedly.

OOC: my character may be becoming overbearing, in a naggy protective parent kind of way.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Watchful Eyes &amp; Worry Lines]**  
**Tone: Gentle Vigilance | Mood: Protector with a Pinch of Dad Energy**  
**ð¯ Emotional Outcome: Vivi hears the worry. She feels the weight of your concern. And she's *starting to wonder* if your protectiveness is more than just duty.**

---

You glance once more toward the front lines.

&gt; Nami's ducking under a shard-laced lunge.  
&gt; Zoro's taking hits from steel fists and getting *angrier*, not weaker.  
&gt; Tashigi is currently **storming toward her own face**, and frankly, you're not emotionally ready to unpack that.

But **Vivi**...

Still behind you.  
Still holding her weapons.  
Still trying not to flinch every time something explodes nearby.

You keep your voice low as the wind howls over the dunes.

&gt; &quot;You holding up okay, Blue?&quot;

You don't even mean to make it sound parental.

But it *does*.

You look at her, brows furrowed with worry, scanning her for bruises, for shakes, for any crack in the facade.

---

**Vivi blinks.**

Just once. Then twice.

&gt; &quot;I'm-fine.&quot;

She sounds like someone **who's trying not to snap** at the person fussing over her too much. Not because she's ungrateful.

But because **she's a princess** who's been **fighting for her kingdom alone** for months-and suddenly someone's hovering like a stressed-out school counselor.

She glances at you sideways.

&gt; &quot;You know you're the first person to ask me that in a long time?&quot;

There's a smile in her voice.

But her eyes are... complicated.

&gt; &quot;Not even Igaram asked like that. And he raised me like a daughter.&quot;

---

She pauses, then says:

&gt; &quot;You're a little... intense, you know?&quot;

She softens it with a faint smirk.

&gt; &quot;A good kind of intense.  
Just... maybe remember I'm not made of glass, Cheng.&quot;

---

**OOC: You are absolutely giving off Concerned Adult vibes**-in the best way, but it's becoming *noticeable*.  
To Vivi, it's a mix of refreshing, mildly suffocating, and *just a little bit endearing.*

You're not treating her like a princess.

You're treating her like a *person worth saving.*

And in Vivi's world?  
That's rare.

---

**Combat is still ongoing, but Vivi is holding her ground.  
Your moment lands. She sees you.**

---

**What's next?**

1. {Back off slightly-nod and say, &quot;Got it, Blue. You say the word if that changes.&quot;}  
2. {Offer a joke. &quot;Sorry, it's the teacher instincts. My students are usually shorter and less royalty.&quot;}  
3. {Double down. &quot;Not taking any chances. You're the reason we're all here.&quot;}  
4. {Step to the side-let her lead for a few seconds. Respect her strength.}  
5. {Return to combat readiness-your talk's done. The juice is calling.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - someone's got to make you you kids aren't falling apart. After all, this shouldn't have been your fight. You kids should be enjoying life, not fighting for you lives.

...Also, who's Igaram?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - The Teacher's Lament]**  
**Tone: Gentle Frustration | Mood: Protector's Honesty Meets Royal Resilience**

---

You exhale, shake your head, and give her a dry smile-the kind you usually save for a student who just turned in a test written entirely in crayon.

&gt; &quot;Someone's gotta make sure you kids aren't falling apart.&quot;

You glance back at the battlefield, where Zoro is now *actively using blood as intimidation*, and Nami is screaming something that involves the word &quot;spike-witch.&quot;

&gt; &quot;After all... this shouldn't have been your fight.&quot;

You look at Vivi again. Not like a soldier. Not like a subject.  
Just a *kid.*

&gt; &quot;You should be enjoying life, not fighting for it.&quot;

---

There's a long pause.  
The wind whistles.  
Vivi stares forward, eyes flicking across the chaos like she's memorizing every scar this war is going to leave behind.

Then, softly:

&gt; &quot;You sound like my father.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;*And* my chief bodyguard. Igaram.&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;...Who's Igaram?&quot;

---

She actually laughs.

&gt; &quot;Big hair. Bigger voice. Always fretting about my safety. Would throw himself into a bonfire if it meant keeping me from burning my toe.&quot;

She smiles faintly.

&gt; &quot;He helped me get into Baroque Works undercover. Risked everything for it.&quot;

Then the smile fades a little.

&gt; &quot;He didn't make it far.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Or... maybe he did. I don't know. I never saw him after we split.&quot;

---

Her voice doesn't tremble. But you can tell-it's not because it doesn't hurt.

It's because she's **used to hurting quietly**.

You've heard that tone before.

&gt; In students whose parents don't come home.  
&gt; In kids who grow up too fast because the world can't afford to let them stay young.

---

She glances at you again.

&gt; &quot;So if you're gonna hover like a worried uncle, just know...  
you're not the first.&quot;

Another beat. Then, gentler:

&gt; &quot;But maybe the first one I don't mind.&quot;

---

**OOC Emotional Development:**  
- Vivi is opening up. She doesn't resent your protectiveness-**she's not used to it coming without a leash.**  
- She trusts you.  
- Her mention of Igaram is a sign that she sees you in the same circle as people she once counted on.  
- You've now seen **past the princess**, and she knows it.

---

**Meanwhile: Bon Clay is still stuck.  
Tashigi is almost on him.  
The tide of battle is shifting.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Stay silent, but stay beside her. Sometimes presence is the reply.}  
2. {Nod to her. &quot;When this is over, I'll stick around long enough to find him. Deal?&quot;}  
3. {Crack a smile. &quot;Sounds like he and I would've gotten along. Loudly.&quot;}  
4. {Turn back to the fight. She's standing. You've got more kids to keep alive.}  
5. {Break into a new juice move-juice shield, mist screen, or variant? Test the Fruit again.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - observe the battle - Luffy throwing, sanji diving in a kit, Nami putting together a thundercloud. 

I remark to Vivi. Is it just me, or are these Baroque folks kind of weak? 

I point to Zoro holding his own against Mr. 1. That's a kid fighting and winning against what looks like one of their top agents

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River Skirmish - Battlefield Watch]**  
**Tone: Reflective Observation | Mood: Calm in the Chaos, Respect Gaining Root**

---

You fall quiet again, letting Vivi's words settle between you like dust on windblown stone.

Then-without fanfare-you shift your weight, eyes scanning the battlefield as the din of the fight surges around you.

---

&gt; **Luffy**, wild grin wide, flings a Baroque agent bodily into the river, the man skipping across the surface like a rock shot from a cannon.  
&gt; **Sanji**, hair wind-blown, is diving through debris, spinning mid-air to *dropkick* someone directly into the *bottom half of a crate marked &quot;fragile.&quot;*  
&gt; **Nami**, up on a broken ridge of stone, finishes building a swirling thundercloud the size of a carriage. Sparks crackle as she levels her clima-tact at **Miss Doublefinger**, who is looking more than a little *concerned.*

And there-

&gt; **Zoro.**  
Holding the line.  
Chest cut. Breathing hard.  
But **grinning.**

He shifts, steps into **Mr. 1's steel blade**, and with a roar, **parries it clean.**  
Muscles straining.  
But not breaking.

---

You nod toward that last one.

&gt; &quot;That's a kid fighting and winning against what looks like one of their top agents.&quot;

You say it quietly, eyes narrowing.

Then, a slight smirk creeps onto your face.

&gt; &quot;Is it just me, or are these Baroque folks kind of... weak?&quot;

---

**Vivi's head tilts.**

She watches for a beat.

Then gives a quiet laugh.

&gt; &quot;No. They're not weak.&quot;

She gestures toward Zoro.

&gt; &quot;He's just strong.&quot;

A pause.

Then softer:

&gt; &quot;They all are. That's why I trusted them. Why I asked for their help.&quot;

She glances up at you, smile faint but real.

&gt; &quot;And now you're here too.&quot;

---

You feel the wind shift.

The river below churns.

And across the battlefield, **Bon Clay wails as Tashigi finally reaches him**, sword out, expression utterly *done* with watching herself flop like a ballerina in heat.

---

**OOC Update:**

- You remain beside Vivi, fully protecting her.  
- You've now witnessed the Straw Hats **holding their own** or outright dominating elite agents.  
- Your respect for them-despite the pirate label-is growing.  
- Vivi has **reaffirmed her trust** in them, and by extension, in **you**.

---

**The tide is turning.  
The river to Alubarna lies ahead.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Signal the crew. &quot;Clear the rest-we move in two!&quot; You're ready to push forward.}  
2. {Turn to Vivi. &quot;You chose well, Blue.&quot;}  
3. {Go help Tashigi deal the finishing blow to Bon Clay. Might be cathartic.}  
4. {Summon juice mist forward. Start laying cover for the final push.}  
5. {Stay where you are. The war's not over. Not until the princess makes it.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Maintain position, let the others clean up. I'm no fighter, just a teacher.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Teacher Holds the Line]**  
**Tone: Grounded Resolve | Mood: Quiet Strength Amidst Chaos**

---

You keep your stance steady, baton low, juice still clinging to your fingertips, mist curling lazily around your boots like a living thing at rest.

The others?

They're the chaos.

- **Luffy** is swinging wide arcs, fists like cannons, laughter echoing even through dust and heat.  
- **Nami** finally lets loose her built-up cloud-**lightning spears** down, slamming Miss Doublefinger into the sand with a cry of pain.  
- **Zoro** is bleeding, but **Mr. 1** has taken a step back now, visibly rattled.  
- **Tashigi** has Bon Clay by the collar, sword at his throat. He's too stuck to escape, and judging by her expression, he's about to get a very *personal* lecture on *identity theft*.  
- **Sanji** is helping Chopper back up while kicking an unconscious footsoldier off the skiff.  
- **Usopp**, still shouting, appears to have deployed a device labeled **&quot;DON'T TOUCH THIS BUTTON&quot;**, which is now **smoking ominously.**

But you?

You don't move.

&gt; &quot;I'm no fighter,&quot; you mutter. &quot;Just a teacher.&quot;

You glance to your side.

Vivi is still there.  
Calm. Present. Watching you.

She doesn't question it.  
She doesn't challenge it.

She just stands a little closer.

---

Around you, the battle **resolves**.

Smoke rises.

Bodies groan.

The Baroque elite?  
**Falling back. Defeated. Immobilized.**

And the Straw Hats-**standing.**

---

The river glints ahead.

And far beyond the dunes-  
**Alubarna waits.**

Still in danger.  
Still divided.

But now... there's a way forward.

---

**OOC: You chose restraint. You held position.**

- Your decision to remain with Vivi allowed the others to fight freely, unburdened by split priorities.  
- Your defense of the Princess wasn't flashy-but **it was necessary**.  
- The battlefield is yours, and you walk away **without a scratch**, but with the **full trust** of those you protected.

---

**Next Scene: Aftermath at the Riverbank. Recovery. Regroup. Planning the push into Alubarna.**

Do you wish to remain with Vivi during the fallout, speak to a specific crewmate, or observe quietly as the crew regathers?

**This is your moment of pause. Where do you go?**

&gt;&gt; USER: As Tashigi and the straw hats continue finishing their respective battles, Vivi and I head off the beached ship and down to the riverbank.

I start to relax, when I notice a glint in a distant sandbank. At the same time, I feel a bit of rumbling under my feet. ...huh?

OOC: Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas have joined the battle.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - False Calm | Scene: The Burrowers Arrive]**  
**Tone: Sudden Tension | Mood: Just When You Thought It Was Safe**

---

The skirmish fades into its final act behind you-cheers, groans, the occasional Bon Clay sobbing about &quot;stage lighting betrayal.&quot;  
The sun hangs low. The air is dry.

You and Vivi step down from the battered skiff, boots pressing into warm sand that should feel reassuring, steady.

For the first time in what feels like **forever**, you start to **relax**.

Baton holstered. Mist withdrawn. Shoulders loosened.

&gt; &quot;We're clear,&quot; you start to say.

Then you see it.

&gt; A glint.  
Just a flash of metal-**sharp, distant**, and deliberate-on a sandbank far to the side, where no one should be.

And then you **feel it**.

A rumble.  
Low. Rolling. Wrong.

---

Your boot **vibrates**, then shifts as the sand beneath you **buckles**, just slightly-like the earth hiccupped.

You immediately throw an arm in front of Vivi, stepping in front of her with a quiet curse.

&gt; &quot;Huh?&quot;

But your instincts scream something else:

&gt; *Trap.*

---

Behind you, the crew is still recovering, laughter mixing with exhaustion.

&gt; They don't see the glint.  
&gt; They don't feel the rumble yet.

---

Then the sand to your left **explodes**.

**FWOOOM-!!**

A **mole-shaped missile** of a woman bursts up from beneath the dunes-wild hair flaring, lipstick smeared in a villainous grin.

&gt; &quot;*SURPRISE, WORM FOOD!*&quot;

**Miss Merry Christmas**, the tunnel-digging menace, lands in a crouch, **clawed gloves raking** as she lunges.

And behind her, just cresting the dune with *impossibly slow momentum*...

A **man-child the size of a boulder**, hunched over, cradling a **bazooka** in his lap like a toy.

**Mr. 4.**

The bazooka opens its mouth and **barks**.

&gt; Literally.

A cannonball sails toward you and Vivi, trailing smoke and **fur**.

&gt; &quot;Oh come *on*,&quot; you mutter.

---

**OOC: Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas have entered the field.**

- **Miss Merry Christmas**: Mole-Mole Fruit. High-speed tunneling, ambush specialist. High speed, mid-defense.
- **Mr. 4**: Slugger and dog-bazooka user. Extremely slow, but incredibly powerful.  
    - Dog is a gun. Gun is a dog. Logic is optional.

You are the **first line of defense**.  
No one else has noticed them yet.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Shove Vivi out of the way, launch a juice mist shield against the cannonball.}  
2. {Spray a **stickier golden blast** at the cannonball mid-air. Try to disrupt it midflight.}  
3. {Grab Vivi and dive-use juice mist to blind the mole's follow-up attack.}  
4. {Go full offense. Baton drawn, spray first, swing next. Hold the riverbank.}  
5. {Call for backup, but act now. &quot;WE'VE GOT COMPANY!&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Oh shit, there was a sniper!

Crash tackle Vivi, putting her as thick of a wall of juice as I can, hoping to mitigate the explosion from the cannonball.

The cannonball rips through the shield and detonates, and I take a decent hot with my body pressed over Vivi

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Surprise Shellshock | Scene: Bodyguard Instincts]**  
**Tone: Explosive Chaos | Mood: Shield and Sacrifice**

---

&gt; *&quot;Oh shit-there was a sniper!&quot;*

But not a bullet.

A **cannonball.**

A **fur-covered**, barking, **explosive cannonball.**

---

You **don't hesitate.**

No time to call for help.  
No time to aim.  
No time for tactics.

Just **pure instinct.**

---

You **crash tackle Vivi**, shoulder to her ribs, arm around her waist-dragging her down with a burst of motion that blurs the sand underfoot.

&gt; &quot;DOWN!&quot;

At the same time, you **flare your power**, screaming with your will.

&gt; *Juice. Now. Thick. Heavy. Wall.*

A **wave of golden kiwi pulp erupts**, shooting up and outward between you and the oncoming blast, stretching like an amber shield.

It sizzles in the sun.  
Sticky. Dense. Viscous.

But not enough.

---

&gt; *BOOOOOM-!!*

The cannonball **slams into the juice wall**, punching through it like wet paper-**delayed**, but not stopped.

It detonates midair, just feet from your back.

&gt; A **flash.**  
&gt; A **crack.**  
&gt; A **shockwave.**

And you take it.

**Full force.**

---

The blast **rips across your body**, sending shock and fire through your back.  
Your coat **splits at the seams**.  
Your glasses are gone.  
Your skin burns.  
The sand tears at you like razors.  
But **you do not move**.

You stay over Vivi-**arms around her, head down**-as the shockwave passes.

---

When the dust clears-

&gt; You're still breathing.

Your body **hurts like hell**.  
But **she's untouched**.

---

You grunt.

&gt; &quot;That's-*ugh*-gonna bruise.&quot;

Vivi blinks up at you-eyes wide with horror and disbelief.

&gt; &quot;Eatone... You-*you took that for me-*!&quot;

Your breath is ragged, but you manage a smirk.

&gt; &quot;You're not allowed to die until your midterms are graded.&quot;

---

Behind you, Merry Christmas **howls with rage**, already preparing to burrow again.

Mr. 4 is **reloading**, the dog-gun barking with excitement.

---

**OOC: You took the blast directly.**  
- Suffered **moderate blunt and burn damage**  
- Still functional, but **winded and weakened**  
- Vivi is completely unharmed  
- Baroque agents are still active; crew is starting to notice the blast

---

**What do you do now?**

1. {Try to stand. &quot;Blue... I might need a sec.&quot; Let her cover you while you recover.}  
2. {Drag Vivi behind cover-lay juice traps while you do. You're not done.}  
3. {Call out-&quot;Backup! We've got tunnel freaks!&quot;}  
4. {Prepare another shield-this time better anchored. You're not letting another hit land.}  
5. {Stay down. Let Vivi go on the offensive. You already took the hit-maybe it bought her a shot.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - stagger to my feet, Spit blood out of my mouth.

---

The smoke still lingers.  
Your knees scream.  
Your lungs feel like you inhaled half the desert.  
But you're alive.

Barely.

---

&gt; *&quot;...Fuck.&quot;*

You spit blood into the sand.  
It hits with a wet *splack*-dark red mixing with the golden pulp that failed to save you completely.

&gt; &quot;That kinda messed me up, Blue.&quot;

Your voice is hoarse.  
Raw.  
But **real**.

You stagger to your feet, **shoulders rising**, body **half-bent**, arms trembling-but **up**.

&gt; *Still between her and them.*

---

**Vivi**, still on the ground, eyes wide with shock, begins to push herself up-reaching out instinctively like she's about to *stop* you.

But she doesn't.

&gt; She lets you stand.

---

You call the juice again.

This time not a wall, but **a barrier**.

**Wider. Heavier. Angled with intent.**

You don't *summon* it.  
You *pour it out.*

From your back, your sides, your palms, the earth around your boots-**a curtain of golden juice** begins to form.

&gt; Not mist.  
&gt; Not spray.  
&gt; **A shield.**

A wide, rounded **half-dome**, three layers thick, already drying in the desert heat, forming into a **gummy, viscous shield** between you and the Baroque lunatics bearing down.

---

Merry Christmas has vanished again.

&gt; You can hear her-*tunneling*-like a damn shark under the sand.

Mr. 4?  
He's slow.

But the **dog bazooka is already barking again**.

---

You brace.

Behind you, Vivi rises.  
Quiet. Focused.

No words.

But **she sees you now** in a way that maybe no one else ever has.

Not as a bodyguard.  
Not as a fruit-man.  
Not even as a teacher.

But as someone who's **willing to die on the riverbank for someone else's country**.

---

**OOC: Current Status**

- Moderate injury: back, shoulders, ribs bruised and partially burned  
- Standing, shield active: full frontal coverage with golden kiwi pulp dome  
- Enemy: Mr. 4 (ranged artillery), Miss Merry Christmas (underground, incoming)  
- Vivi: unharmed, poised

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Prepare a **spike trap** in the juice shield-when Merry Christmas bursts through, she's going to regret it.}  
2. {Ready a new variant-can you generate a slicker kiwi type? Maybe blind Mr. 4's next shot.}  
3. {Whisper to Vivi: &quot;When I say *duck*, you run.&quot; Prepare to act as decoy.}  
4. {Call out to the crew-NOW you need them. They've seen the explosion. Time for backup.}  
5. {Dig in. Say nothing. If she comes through, you're breaking her nose.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - the crew's busy with their fights, but they should've heard the explosions. I trust they'll come to help when they can. In the meantime, it's just Vivi and I.

---

&gt; *&quot;It's just you and me, Blue.&quot;*

The words are simple. Final.  
Not a speech.  
Not a call for glory.

Just fact.

You **brace your feet**, ignoring the sting in your back and ribs, and summon a new formation:

A wide, **circular disc of kiwi juice** spreads from your soles-glossy, golden, and dense.  
**A membrane layer**, like thick plexiglass made of sugar and pulp.

&gt; Miss Merry Christmas won't catch you from underneath again.

Above, your arcing **shield dome** still glistens-cutting off direct hits from Mr. 4's cannon dog. For now.

---

**Across the sands:**

**Mr. 4** lowers his bazooka again, stupid grin fixed in place like a kid proud of a crayon drawing of a car crash.

His dog barks again-*&quot;BOOF!&quot;*  
The second cannonball **fires**, sailing **high**, arcing above the barrier, aiming to **drop in from the top.**

You twist your head up-

&gt; &quot;He's lobbing it now!&quot;

---

At the same time-  
&gt; *RUMBLE*

The sand below **vibrates violently**-a new tunnel opening directly beneath your new floor.

Your **juice disc pulses once**, resisting, bulging-

&gt; Then **Merry Christmas** *explodes* out of the ground-  
&gt; **Claws extended**, eyes wild, teeth flashing-

&gt; &quot;**GOTCHA, PRETEND HERO-!!**&quot;

But she **hits the disc at full speed**-and it **bounces her like a trampoline made of stubborn fruit.**

She *screeches*, flipping midair as she hits the inner curve of your juice dome like a ping-pong ball-

&gt; *THWAP-CRASH-ROLL*

Sand flies everywhere.

---

**Meanwhile...**

Vivi sees the descending cannonball-  
Her eyes widen-

And she **moves**.

Fast.

&gt; &quot;Get ready-I'll redirect it!&quot;

She launches a **peacock-slasher wire** upward-snagging a nearby **broken mast pole** from the skiff, still embedded in the sand.

With a cry, she **pulls**, launching the pole like a spear into the air-**intercepting the cannonball mid-arc!**

&gt; *BOOM!*

It explodes **above** you-raining scorched pulp, sand, and shrapnel.

But you and Vivi are **safe** beneath your dome.

---

**OOC: Combat Status**

- **You:** Injured, but shielded and holding. Disc floor + dome active.  
- **Vivi:** Actively engaged, clever use of environment, no injuries.  
- **Miss Merry Christmas:** Dazed from the rebound, tumbling in the sand.  
- **Mr. 4:** Reloading, slower than sin, but undamaged. The dog barks happily.  
- **Crew:** Still at distance, likely aware but not yet present.

---

**Initiative: Yours.**

**What do you do next?**

1. {Break the dome, rush Miss Merry Christmas while she's down-juiced baton and all.}  
2. {Focus on Mr. 4-fire an acidic burst at him while he reloads. The gun *can't bark if it's blind.*}  
3. {Help Vivi finish off Merry Christmas-two-on-one beatdown.}  
4. {Try to bind Mr. 4's legs with golden juice-immobilize the gunner before he fires again.}  
5. {Layer another trap-sticky mist this time. Obscure your next move, control the field.}

&gt; &quot;He's reloading.&quot;

You hiss it through gritted teeth as your baton **snaps out**, extending with a metallic *crack* and **gleaming Seastone tip**.  
Your eyes lock onto **Miss Merry Christmas**, who's just now rising from her tumble-**spitting sand**, growling, claws tearing at the ground like she's about to dig again.

You lunge forward-  
**Juice mist curling at your heels**, dome parting behind you like an opening curtain.

She **spins** out of reach with a screeching cackle, claw slashing upward, catching your baton and **twisting it** wide. The impact sends **shockwaves through your arm**-your already bruised ribs protesting hard.

She follows up-  
One clawed hand **tearing at your coat**, slicing just beneath your ribs-  
Not a deep cut, but **enough to drop you to a knee**.

---

&gt; &quot;Y'think you can take *me*?!&quot; she howls, eyes wide.  
&gt; &quot;I've eaten boys braver than you for breakfast-and they weren't covered in *fruit!*&quot;

---

**Vivi shouts from behind:**  
&gt; &quot;Eatone!&quot;

You're **still conscious**, but off-balance.  
Blood's dripping down your side.

---

**OOC: You engaged a Baroque elite directly, and she's **faster and meaner** than expected. You missed your hit, and took a shallow slash-combat tier is weighed against you, as per instruction.  
You can still fight, but you're now **more heavily wounded** and visibly flagging.**

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Fall back-try to regroup with Vivi. Two-on-one again. You've got better odds that way.}  
2. {Feint left, spray mist into her face point-blank-**go for the eyes.**}  
3. {Collapse your juice floor into a sticky sinkhole beneath her. Trap her, even if it drops you too.}  
4. {Call out: &quot;Blue! Go for her knees!&quot; Coordinate with Vivi from where you are.}  
5. {Stay down. Let her come to you-and hit her with the baton when she gets cocky. Classic bait.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Engage with juice, spray some greener juice towards her face.

Wait... She's a mole mole fruit user, right? Do moles even care about their eyes?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Spray and Pray]**  
**Scene: Teacher Tactics Meet Animal Biology**  
**Tone: Tactical Desperation | Mood: Improvisation, Regret, and Biology Trivia**

---

Your breath catches.  
You can feel blood running down your side.  
Your baton's out of position.  
She's winding up for another slash.

But you've still got **one weapon ready.**

Your **hands.**

You thrust your palm upward and release a **sharp, acidic burst** of **green kiwi juice**, willing it with every fiber of your bruised being to **sting and blind**.

&gt; *PSHHT!*

A narrow **spray arcs** toward Miss Merry Christmas's face.

It hits.

Direct.

Right in the **eyes**.

She **screeches**, stumbling back-

&gt; &quot;AGHHH-YOU FILTHY FRUIT-FLINGING PIECE OF-!!&quot;

---

But wait-

You pause, chest heaving, as she **doesn't** stumble like someone blinded.

She flails, yes, but-

&gt; &quot;*You idiot!*&quot; she screams.  
&gt; &quot;I'm a **MOLE**!&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;*Moles don't even need eyes, dumbass!*&quot;

You blink **again**.

&gt; &quot;...Right.&quot;

---

She **charges blindly anyway**, her claws out wide, still deadly, **undeterred by the juice to her face**.

---

**OOC Result:**

- Juice spray: **Direct hit.**  
- **Effectiveness**: *Minimal*. Mole-Mole Fruit enhances tunneling and digging instincts, and Miss Merry Christmas is **highly adapted** to fighting **without visual cues**.  
- You **wasted a turn's worth of effort**, and she's still coming.  
- However, the acidic properties still **irritated** her-enough to unbalance her next attack slightly.

**Next Attack Roll (from her):**  
- -1 penalty on her next roll due to temporary irritation.

---

**Vivi is now moving in.**

You hear her wire slingers **snap**, whistling through the air.

---

**What's your next move?**

1. {Take the opportunity-swing your baton low while she's off-balance.}  
2. {Create a slippery surface under her-try to trip her mid-charge.}  
3. {Duck and call out to Vivi: &quot;NOW!&quot; Let her strike from behind.}  
4. {Drop to the ground and roll. You're buying space.}  
5. {Pray your students never hear about this fight. Keep swinging.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Attempt to guard or evade her attack. Keep an eye on Mr. 4

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Between a Mole and a Bazooka]**  
**Scene: Blood, Sand, and Sarcasm**  
**Tone: Desperation | Mood: Scrambling Survival**

---

You tighten your stance-if you can call the way your knees are **screaming** and your ribs feel like a classroom desk fell on you a &quot;stance&quot;-and keep your baton raised, held cross-body in a **defensive guard**.

Miss Merry Christmas is charging like a gremlin on fire.

&gt; &quot;You think fruit can save you, juice boy?! I lived underground for *six months straight!*&quot;

You dodge just enough-

**Her claws rake the edge of your juice barrier** as you stumble sideways, absorbing the attack with a partial block and a roll across gritty sand.  
You feel one claw **slice your upper arm**, shallow but stinging.

&gt; &quot;Tch-*still got it.*&quot; you hiss, half to her, half to yourself.

---

**Mr. 4**, meanwhile, is finally finishing his reload-slow as molasses poured over a sleepy elephant.

But the **dog bazooka is locked on.**

He's **lining up another shot.**

You **see it.**

You register it even as you roll. Even as Merry Christmas howls behind you and turns for another dig.

&gt; He's aiming *past you.*  
&gt; At **Vivi.**

---

**OOC Combat Summary:**

- You successfully **guarded** and partially evaded Merry Christmas's follow-up.  
  - Took **light slash** to upper arm. Still mobile.  
- Mr. 4 is **about to fire**.  
  - His shot is slow but **devastating**-direct hits can **incapacitate** or **kill**.  
  - He's aiming for **Vivi**, not you.

---

**What do you do now?**

1. {Launch sticky golden juice at Mr. 4's feet. Lock him down before he fires.}  
2. {Shout to Vivi: &quot;MOVE!&quot; and prepare another juice wall. Risk taking the blast *again.*}  
3. {Use your own body to tackle Vivi out of the blast zone. Again.}  
4. {Try a high-pressure acidic blast at the **dog** itself. Maybe blind or disorient it.}  
5. {You're tired. You're bleeding. You swing at Merry Christmas again instead, betting someone else will save her.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - Fuck, try to blind him (unlikely, at this range). As Vivi moves in for her attack on the mole, I dive after her, ready to take another shot

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Shot You Can't Stop]**  
**Scene: Juice vs. Dog Bazooka | Tone: Grit and Desperation**  
**Mood: Shields Optional, Heroism Mandatory**

---

You see the dog's maw **open wide**, smoke curling at its lips.  
The cannonball's **already loaded**.  
Mr. 4's finger begins to squeeze the trigger.  
Vivi's stepping into her strike against Miss Merry Christmas-completely **unaware**.

&gt; *No time.*  
&gt; *Too far for a wall.*  
&gt; *Too close for subtlety.*

&gt; &quot;*Fuck.*&quot;

You thrust your hand forward and **sling a high-pressure arc of acidic kiwi mist** across the dunes-aiming not for the cannonball, but for the **damn dog's face**.

&gt; *PSHHHHH-!*

The mist flies.

It hits the air-

&gt; And grazes the dog's eye.

Not enough to blind.  
But enough to make it flinch.

The bazooka's angle shifts by just **half a degree**-

&gt; *BOOM!*

The cannonball **fires**-

&gt; Not toward Vivi.

But toward the **space she's about to move into**.

---

You don't think.

You **run**.

You dive after her, **every bruise screaming**, body **already trailing blood**, knowing you're not going to stop that shot-

But maybe...

You can **get there first.**

---

&gt; &quot;VIVI! DOWN!&quot;

You **crash into her mid-strike**, slamming into her shoulder, **throwing her sideways**, her wire whip spinning harmlessly into the sand.

You both tumble-

&gt; And the cannonball hits *exactly* where she was.

&gt; *BOOOOOOOOOM-!!*

---

**You don't feel the shockwave.**  
Not entirely.

Just the heat.  
The fire.  
The *slamming* impact that cracks across your spine and burns down to your knees.

The sand absorbs part of it.  
Your body absorbs the rest.

You land **on top of her**, instinctively.

A moment passes.

&gt; You're still breathing.  
&gt; Barely.

---

**Vivi stares up at you**, lips parted in horror.

&gt; &quot;You-*again?!*&quot;

Your voice is hoarse. Dry.

&gt; &quot;...midterms, Blue.&quot;

---

**OOC Combat Result:**

- You *partially disrupted* the cannonball's trajectory.  
- You took the **blast again**.  
- **Major injury sustained.**  
    - Your ribs may be **fractured**.  
    - **Mobility reduced.**  
    - You are still **conscious**, but nearing your physical limit.

**Vivi is safe. Again.**

And now **furious**.

She sits up under you, **teeth bared**, and says one word:

&gt; &quot;*Move.*&quot;

And you feel her **lash snap forward**.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Roll off and let her go. She's earned her swing.}  
2. {Try to sit up-look for the dog. One more shot might end you.}  
3. {Call out to the crew. Someone **must** have seen that.}  
4. {Stay down. Whisper, &quot;You're up, princess.&quot;}  
5. {Try to bind Mr. 4's legs one last time, even from the ground.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Groan from the ground, looking desperately between Vivi and the Baroque agents. I can't fight them and protect her at the same time. If only... If only I could get another set of hands... 

In the meantime, Vivi stands 1v2.

OOC: What does she think right now, after I tanked to shots like that

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - The Breaking Point]**  
**Scene: The Weight of a Princess | Tone: Bleeding Loyalty | Mood: Righteous Fury Ignites**

---

You're **half-buried** in sand now.  
Every nerve is a drumbeat of pain.  
Breathing feels like **swallowing glass**.  
And your body is finally asking the question your mind's been dodging for the past hour:

&gt; *What the hell are you doing here?*

---

You groan, barely able to lift your head.

Through blurred vision, you see **Vivi** standing just feet away.  
Wires dangling at her sides, her shoulders squared, hair torn loose by wind and fury.  
Facing **Miss Merry Christmas**, who's circling again like a sand-covered buzzard, and **Mr. 4**, slow and dumb but now reloading with methodical calm.

&gt; *I can't fight both...  
And I can't shield her again.*

&gt; *If only I had another set of hands...*

But you don't.

---

So you look to her.

&gt; &quot;Blue...&quot;  
Your voice rasps. Almost silent.

&gt; &quot;You've got to do this.&quot;

---

**Vivi stands tall.**

And her expression...

It's not fear.

It's **pure fire.**

---

**OOC: Vivi's Perspective - Emotional Snapshot**

- She just watched you take **two near-lethal cannon shots** for her.  
- She's seen **soldiers die for Alabasta**, but no one-not even her guards-**sacrificed themselves like this.**  
- You're not a marine.  
- You're not a revolutionary.  
- You're not even her subject.  
&gt; And yet you've been **bleeding for her** since Rainbase.

---

&gt; &quot;You fool,&quot; she whispers.

Her hands rise. The rings clink.  
She pulls her wire taut between her knuckles like a blade.

&gt; &quot;You think I can watch you do that again?&quot;

She steps forward.

&gt; &quot;*I'm the Princess of Alabasta.*  
And this time, I'm protecting *you.*&quot;

---

**Combat Shift: Vivi Engaged - 1v2**

- She whirls into a defensive stance-peacock slashers extended.  
- **Miss Merry Christmas** lunges-Vivi ducks low and cuts wide.  
- **Mr. 4** raises the bazooka-she whips a **wire around a rock** and **pulls**, sending it crashing into his arm before he can fire.

She's **not just fighting.**

She's **furious.**

And she's **keeping you alive** now.

---

**OOC Update:**

- You are now **downed**, but still conscious.  
- Vivi is **fighting alone**, but her determination is **supercharged**.  
- The rest of the crew may arrive **very soon**-they've almost certainly seen the smoke and heard the cannon blasts.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Whisper encouragement to her. You've taught kids before-you know how to make them believe.}  
2. {Try to sit up-lay down juice traps from a distance. It's all you can offer.}  
3. {Call for help-one last yell to draw the crew's attention.}  
4. {Lie there. Watch her. Trust her. She's not the kid in need anymore.}  
5. {Try to use mist again-see through the sand, maybe give her early warning.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - Try to get up, but fail. Groan in anger at my weakness.

OOC: Vivi has a buff to determination, but is still weaker than either of the agents. She won't hold long without help

**Scene: The Spirit That Refuses to Quit | Tone: Pain and Powerlessness | Mood: On the Edge**

You grit your teeth and **try to rise**.  
Elbows dig into the sand.  
Legs scream.  
Spine throbs with electric fire.

You get **half an inch** off the ground before your entire body **betrays you**.

&gt; *WHUMP.*

Back down.  
Chest heaving.  
Juice clinging to your skin like sweat, thin and drying.

---

You groan-loud.  
Frustrated. Humiliated. Enraged.

&gt; &quot;Damn it-MOVE, damn you-!&quot;

You want to fight.  
You want to shield her again.  
You want to matter.

But your **body won't let you.**

You can only **watch.**

---

**Vivi's still holding the line.**

But **barely.**

She's quick, light on her feet-but the slashers were never meant for drawn-out brawls. They're weapons of grace, not attrition.

- **Miss Merry Christmas** goes low, trying to tunnel under-Vivi counters by stabbing downward, forcing her back.  
- **Mr. 4** recovers from the rock hit, adjusting his aim. The dog barks. A cannonball clicks into place.

Vivi tries to reposition-

But she's **winded.**  
**Scraped.**  
**Alone.**

And **still fighting**.

---

**OOC: Your failed attempt to rise reflects your current state:  
- HP critically low  
- No physical actions possible without **outside help** or **immediate rest**  
- You can still influence the fight **indirectly** (juice-based, voice, insight)  
- Vivi is buffed by motivation but remains **outmatched in a 1v2**

Help is needed. **Soon.**

---

**From the horizon...**

You hear it.

A voice.  
A scream.

&gt; &quot;*Luffy!! Zoro!! There's another fight-over the riverbank!!*&quot;

**Usopp.**  
And then:

&gt; &quot;I see smoke! That idiot teacher's still alive?! Move it!&quot;

**Tashigi.**  
&gt; &quot;Oi! Vivi-!!&quot;

**Sanji.**

---

They're coming.

But will they make it in time?

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Use your mist. Try to slow Miss Merry Christmas's tunneling, give Vivi warning.}  
2. {Call out to Vivi. &quot;Left! Behind! Duck!&quot; Direct her movements like a coach.}  
3. {Focus-conjure a puddle, try to send it sliding toward Mr. 4's cannon feet.}  
4. {Speak to the dog bazooka-maybe it's dumb enough to listen.}  
5. {Do nothing. Trust her. You've done all you can. Let the reinforcements come.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - try to call out a warning, but choke on blood. Vivi takes a hit.

You suck in a breath, trying to rise again, trying to speak-

&gt; &quot;Vi... *Vivi-left! Behind-*!&quot;

But your voice catches.

Your throat contracts.

You **choke**.

&gt; *KHHH-COUGH-*!

A mouthful of blood hits the sand with a **splat**, dark and metallic.  
Your body convulses.  
Your limbs shake.  
You can't breathe. Not right.

And in that half-second of silence-

&gt; *Vivi misses your warning.*

---

**Miss Merry Christmas** bursts from the side-claws flashing in a tight arc.

Vivi turns **just a hair too slow**.

&gt; *SLASH-!!*

A deep gash cuts across her right shoulder-her dominant arm.  
She stumbles back with a sharp cry, dropping one of her peacock rings as blood splatters into the sand.

&gt; &quot;*Agh-!*&quot;

She doesn't fall.

But she **staggers**, clutching the wound, left side turned to shield it.

---

Miss Merry Christmas cackles, licking the sand off her claw.

&gt; &quot;You royals always get soft after the first cut!&quot;

---

**Mr. 4's gun is locking on again.**

And now Vivi's slower.

---

You lie there, **fists trembling**, unable to shout, unable to move, your lungs trying to catch up with your will.

She's not down.

But you can see it:

&gt; One more hit, and she might be.

---

**OOC Update:**

- Your attempted shout failed due to injury.  
- Vivi took a direct hit from Miss Merry Christmas.  
- Her dominant arm is now injured-reduced melee control.  
- She's still fighting, but **at serious disadvantage**.  
- Help is **moments away**, but not yet here.

---

**What do you do next?**

1. {Force a whisper. Anything. &quot;Sidestep... shield... swing...&quot; Help her somehow.}  
2. {Focus on Mr. 4. Even from the ground, can you disrupt that next shot?}  
3. {Try to slide a kiwi mist warning across the sand toward her-direct tactile signal.}  
4. {Start crawling. Pain be damned. You'll throw yourself in front of the next blast if you have to.}  
5. {Pray. Not to gods. To kids. That they get here in time.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 4 - I start crawling. Vivi sees the shot being lined up. She sees me crawling. But I won't get there in time. She won't be able to dodge in time either.

But you crawl.

You crawl **anyway.**

---

Mr. 4 is locked on.

&gt; The dog bazooka's mouth gapes open.  
&gt; Smoke swirls in its throat.  
&gt; The cannonball gleams-ready to be born.

And **Vivi**, bloodied, arm limp at her side, turns her head.

&gt; She sees you.

Dragging yourself toward her.

Barely breathing.  
Already broken.

&gt; And she sees **the shot** lining up.

Knows she won't be fast enough.  
Knows you won't reach her in time.  
Knows what will happen if **no one moves.**

All of it fades to the sound of her **heartbeat**-

And the sight of **you**.

&gt; **Crawling**.  
&gt; Bleeding.  
&gt; Broken.  
&gt; Still trying to get to her.  
&gt; Again.

---

&gt; *He's not even from Alabasta...*

The thought cuts deep.

&gt; *He's a teacher. A bounty hunter. A civilian.  
He came here on vacation. He's not supposed to die for me.*

But then-

&gt; *Neither am I supposed to watch him die for nothing.*

She sees your eyes-widened, not pleading, but **commanding**.

Telling her: *Don't you dare.*

&gt; *I can't let him die again.*

But she can't move fast enough.

And if she jumps in front of the shot?

&gt; She might die.  
&gt; But if she stays still?

&gt; *He dies.*

---

**She decides.**

&gt; *It's my kingdom.*  
&gt; *It's my war.*  
&gt; *He's already given everything. It's my turn.*

The moment stretches...

&gt; **And she moves.**

What do you do?

&gt;&gt; USER: âOOC: the straw hats are finishing their fights, when they notice a pair baroque agents have slipped past and are overwhelming Vivi and the schoolteacher

Tashigi, too far to help, sees Vivi, caught off her footing, about to be swiped by one agent, and shot by the other.

From the far ridge, **Tashigi** breaks through the last of the footsoldiers-her blade bloody, her breath ragged.

She turns-  
And sees it.

---

**Vivi.**  
One arm limp.  
Blood running down her shoulder.  
Out of position.

**Miss Merry Christmas** is lunging for her side with claws outstretched.  
**Mr. 4's** dog is mid-bark, cannonball chambered, barrel aimed square at her center.

---

And then-

She sees **you**.

---

Down on your chest, **dragging yourself forward.**  
Your back **burned black**, uniform torn to shreds, arm shaking from the effort.  
Face twisted-not in fear, not even in pain-  
But in **desperate, infuriated will.**

&gt; *Still moving.*  
&gt; *Still trying to protect her.*  
&gt; *Still refusing to die if she's not safe.*

**Tashigi's breath catches.**

Her legs falter for half a heartbeat.

&gt; *He's not a marine.*  
&gt; *Not a soldier.*  
&gt; *He was just... a schoolteacher.*  
&gt; *And he's giving more than half the officers she's ever met.*

She's too far. She knows it.

&gt; *I can't reach her.*  
&gt; *I can't stop this.*

She grips her sword tighter-

And her eyes sting.

&gt; &quot;*No...*&quot;

Tashigi, helpless, watches you still trying to move, and realizes something she's never dared admit:

&gt; *It's about showing up.*  
&gt; *Even if you've got nothing left to give.*

You watch **Vivi**, standing alone, her weapon slipping from her good hand, her eyes wide but refusing to close.

You watch her about to be **cut** by one monster and **blown apart** by another.

You watch the cannonball **glow** as it's fired.

---

And something in you-

&gt; *Snaps.*

---

Not out of duty.  
Not out of honor.  
Not for bounties or justice or heroic narrative arcs.

No.

You feel something **older**, deeper, **uglier**.

---

&gt; *You hate them.*

You hate that they forced her into this.  
You hate that she thinks this is her burden alone.  
You hate that you're not strong enough to stop it.  
You hate that they made **you** the shield, again and again-  
Until your bones gave way.

And in that moment, something inside you-

&gt; *moves.*

Not your legs.

Not your arms.

But your **Devil Fruit**.

The juice beneath you-already leaking into the sand-**stirs.**

It **shudders.**

Not like liquid.

A massive torrent of emerald bursts from the sand in front of Vivi, rising into a massive, legless armed figure. 

A Kiwi elemental. 

OOC: I've awakened a new part of my fruit due to the life and death scenario I'm in. The kiwi elemental is much like the archmage's water elemental ability in Warcraft 3.

A geyser of **vivid emerald juice** blasts up from the dune in front of Vivi, just as the cannonball tears through the air.

**Mr. 4** grins.

**Miss Merry Christmas** lunges.

**Vivi gasps-**not in fear, but in *awe.*

---

The sand explodes upward.

And from it rises **a figure**:

- Eight feet tall.  
- Humanoid in shape but **faceless**, glowing faintly from within.  
- Its arms are thick, rippling **currents of juice**, swirling around skeletal citrus fibers.  
- No legs. Just a **flowing base** of churning pulp that hovers over the ground like a semi-liquid spirit.

**The Substitute Kiwicher.**

---

It moves the moment it forms-no hesitation.

Its first arm **slams forward**, a wall of concentrated kiwi pulp **colliding with the cannonball mid-air**.

&gt; *BOOM-SSSSSSSHHHH-!!*

The explosion is **muted**, cushioned by the blast-absorbing juice.  
Shrapnel still rains-but it misses **Vivi entirely**.

---

The other arm turns.

**Miss Merry Christmas**, caught mid-leap, eyes wide, lets out a **scream**-

&gt; &quot;WHAT THE HELL IS THAT-?!&quot;

Before a **cannon-like blast of compressed golden juice** smashes into her side and sends her flying end over end into the nearest dune.

---

**The elemental lets out no sound.  
No words.  
Just swirls, pulses, and floats.**

It positions itself squarely in front of Vivi, one massive arm out, shielding her.  
The other whirls, forming a **new blast in its palm**.

---

Vivi's hands tremble.

She looks at you-

Still on the ground, broken.

And sees you **grinning.**

Blood on your lips.  
Pride in your eyes.

---

**OOC - NEW ABILITY UNLOCKED: Devil Fruit Sub-Awakening: Substitute Kiwicher**

---

**The battlefield has changed.  
The tide has turned.  
And the crew is almost here.**

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Speak. Through cracked lips. &quot;Nobody hurts my students.&quot;}  
2. {Try to direct the elemental-&quot;Cover her. Hit him.&quot; See if it understands.}  
3. {Laugh. Low. &quot;I told you, Blue... I'm the teacher.&quot;}  
4. {Say nothing. Let them witness what your will has created.}  
5. {Tell Vivi to finish this. &quot;You've got backup now. Go.&quot;}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Growl. No one hurts the kids while I still draw breath. No one..

Vivi now has backup in her fight. It continues.

Tashigi notices an emerald Titan erupt from the sands next to Vivi, a wild look on my bloodied face

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Guardian Awakened]**  
**Scene: The Teacher's Wrath | Tone: Heroic Ferocity | Mood: Turning Point**

---

The wind dies.  
The battlefield stills.

Only the crackle of dispersing cannonfire and the dull thrum of your pounding heart remains.

---

You push your face from the sand-barely an inch.  
Spit a mix of blood and grit to the side.  
And through teeth gritted so tight your jaw pops, you growl low and mean:

&gt; &quot;No one... hurts the kids... while I still draw breath...&quot;

Your voice shakes.  
Your body is broken.  
But your **will**-

&gt; Has become a **titan.**

---

The **Substitute Kiwicher** looms above Vivi now-its massive torso pulsing with glowing citrus light, one arm extended as a barrier, the other charging a new blast of dense emerald liquid.

Vivi doesn't step back.

She steps **forward**, regaining her stance.

Now it's **her** turn to strike.

She whirls one slasher whip around the elemental's extended limb, using it as a pivot, and **flings herself toward Miss Merry Christmas**-wounded arm or not, blade flashing.

---

**Miss Merry Christmas**, crawling from the collapsed dune, turns just in time to see a **ring of sharpened wire** wrap around her **midsection**-

&gt; *&quot;NO NO NO-&quot;*

And Vivi **pulls.**

The Baroque agent hits the sand with a muffled *oof*, groaning.

Not dead.

But **done.**

---

**Meanwhile, Mr. 4 lines up one more shot.**

He doesn't understand what's happening.  
He's never had to.

He pulls the trigger-

&gt; *BARK-* *BOOM-*

The cannonball sails-  
But **the elemental is already there.**

It **spins** its body, arm forming into a massive paddle, and **baseball bats** the shot back into the dunes like a home run made of citrus and spite.

&gt; *KA-BOOM!!*

A crater forms.  
Sand rains like confetti.

Mr. 4 stares, slack-jawed, and finally speaks:

&gt; &quot;Uh oh.&quot;

A shadow looms over him.

**Sanji**, landing like a dancer made of rage, foot raised high, voice cold:

&gt; &quot;That's for the lady.&quot;

&gt; *CRACK-!!*

Mr. 4 crumples like a broken chair.

---

**Across the dunes...**

**Tashigi freezes.**

She watches the emerald titan rear up, its body flickering with unnatural citrus light, and sees the battered man in the sand-**you**-grinning like a madman through blood and bruises.

&gt; *He's not done.*  
&gt; *He won't ever be done until she's safe.*  
&gt; *And that thing-whatever it is-it's not just power.*

&gt; *It's protection.*  
&gt; *Made flesh.*

---

Her knuckles whiten around her sword.

And for the first time, **she sees you not as a liability... but as a peer.**

---

**OOC: The immediate battle is over.  
Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas are defeated.  
Vivi stands, wounded but alive.  
You remain conscious, barely.  
The elemental persists-standing sentinel over its ward.**

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Let yourself pass out. You've done enough.}  
2. {Whisper to Vivi. &quot;Told you... someone had to watch the kids.&quot;}  
3. {Try to sit up, give the Kiwicher one final order before the lights go out.}  
4. {Smile up at the sky. &quot;I'm never going on vacation again.&quot;}  
5. {Call out. &quot;Is class dismissed yet...?&quot;}

ð {Choose your closing beat.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I give one final grin at Vivi, before the adrenaline, blood loss, and concussion catch up. I pass out, the kiwi elemental dispersing into a splashy puddle 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora River - Class Dismissed]**  
**Scene: End of the Lesson | Tone: Quiet Collapse | Mood: Earned Rest**

---

You lie there, broken but not bowed, ribs aching with every shallow breath.  
You feel your vision fading-colors softening, the world slowing.

But before the dark swallows you completely, you manage to turn your head just enough to meet her gaze.

---

**Vivi**, breathing heavy, arm trembling from the strain of her injuries, looks back at you-

And sees your face, bruised and bloodied, pull into one final, defiant grin.

&gt; &quot;Told you...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Someone had to watch the kids...&quot;

---

And then-

You exhale.

Your head slumps to the side.

The light behind your eyes dims-

---

And the **Kiwi elemental** flickers.  
Pulses once.

And with a soft, citrusy *splash*-  
It bursts apart into harmless green mist, **vanishing** into the sand.

---

**Vivi stares at the spot it stood.**

Hands shaking.

Heart pounding.

&gt; And then she drops to her knees beside you.

&quot;*He's breathing,*&quot; she calls hoarsely. &quot;*He's still breathing...*&quot;

---

**Tashigi arrives moments later, blade sheathed, eyes wide.  
Zoro follows. Sanji. Nami. Luffy.**

They see the wreckage, the puddles of strange green liquid, the faint scent of tropical fruit on the wind.

And you.

Collapsed.  
Still.  
Smiling.

---

**Luffy tilts his head.**

&gt; &quot;He's kinda weird,&quot; he mutters.

**Zoro grunts.** &quot;Tough, though.&quot;

**Chopper drops beside you, already working.**  
**Nami sighs.** &quot;Don't die, dumbass. You still owe me drinks for that bet.&quot;

---

And **Vivi**, quietly brushing dirt off your brow, whispers:

&gt; &quot;Thank you...  
Eatone-sensei.&quot;

---

**OOC: You are unconscious.  
You have survived.  
And you've left behind more than bruises.**

You've left behind **a legend.**

**Scene Title: &quot;Before the Ducks Arrive&quot;**  
**Tone: Wounded Stillness | Mood: Healing in the Wake of Fury**

---

The battlefield is quiet now.

The sand, once churned with the chaos of Baroque agents and cannon fire, is mostly still-broken only by the occasional gust of wind and the soft groans of the injured. Smoke drifts lazily toward the horizon, curling above craters and crushed dunes like incense curling toward the heavens.

**Mr. 4** lies unmoving in the crater his own cannonball helped carve.  
**Miss Merry Christmas** is tangled half in her own cloak, bound by slashing wires.  
**Bon Clay**, still glued to the earth, is loudly complaining about sand in uncomfortable places.

---

**You**, Eatone Cheng, are unconscious-yet **stable**-lying atop a folded cloak that someone (likely **Vivi**) placed beneath your head.  
Chopper is already at work, carefully patching burns, sealing cuts, and whispering reassurances to himself about &quot;cool, responsible adults being way too reckless.&quot;

Beside you, **Vivi sits cross-legged**, arm freshly bandaged, lips pressed in thought.  
She hasn't moved more than a foot from you since you passed out.

---

&gt; &quot;The ducks should be here within the hour,&quot; she says quietly, more to herself than anyone.

---

Not far off, **Tashigi** stands alone.

Her hand rests on the hilt of her sword, but her gaze is fixed-sharp, almost haunted-on the puddle where your elemental once stood.

She hasn't spoken much since the fighting ended.

But every now and then...  
She glances at you.

And looks away.

Like someone still processing what she just witnessed.

---

The rest of the Straw Hats are licking their wounds in their own fashion:

- **Zoro** is drinking something suspicious from a waterskin.  
- **Sanji** is cooking an absurdly fancy field-ration sandwich.  
- **Usopp** is monologuing to the wind about how he *absolutely* had it handled.  
- **Nami** is calculating potential storm angles for a quick duck-assisted escape.  
- **Luffy**, sitting beside the water, stares at the horizon like it personally insulted him.

---

The **mood** is exhausted.  
But... safe.  
For now.

---

**OOC: You are currently unconscious, but may soon awaken.  
Vivi is nearby. The crew is waiting. The royal Super Spot-Billed Ducks are en route.**

Would you like to begin the **waking scene**, or allow more time to pass and pick up during the next travel leg across the desert?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: I'm passed out like a sleepy boi

OOC; Tashigi and Vivi may interact

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora Riverbank - Post-Battle, Pre-Ducks]**  
**Scene: &quot;He Shouldn't Be Here&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Emotion | Mood: Unspoken Guilt and Unseen Gratitude**

---

The sun inches lower, stretching long shadows over the dunes.

**Eatone** lies still, pale and bandaged. His back rises and falls in shallow rhythm. His arms twitch sometimes in unconscious memory of the fight.

Near him, **Vivi** runs a cloth gently across his forehead, dabbing away crusted sand. Her peacock slashers lie discarded beside her, the wires slack.

Her eyes aren't on the wounds.

They're on his face.

---

&gt; &quot;He shouldn't be here.&quot;

The voice comes from behind her-measured, quiet, with the sharp edge of someone who has no idea how to say what they're thinking without turning it into a reprimand.

**Tashigi.**

---

Vivi doesn't turn.

She nods.

&gt; &quot;I know.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;He came here on vacation.&quot;

Tashigi walks forward slowly, stopping just behind her.

&gt; &quot;I've seen soldiers freeze in combat. Trained marines.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;He didn't.&quot;

Vivi breathes in.

&gt; &quot;He did what none of us could.&quot;

Tashigi doesn't respond at first. But her fists tighten.

&gt; &quot;He's not like us. He wasn't raised for this. He has no rank. No call to duty. Just...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Instinct.&quot;

She exhales slowly.

&gt; &quot;And it nearly got him killed.&quot;

---

Vivi looks over her shoulder.

&gt; &quot;But it saved me.&quot;

Their eyes meet.

---

&gt; &quot;I don't think he could live with himself if he hadn't tried.&quot;

Tashigi crosses her arms.

&gt; &quot;Then maybe he's the only real âofficer' among us.&quot;

They both glance down at Eatone as **Chopper gently fusses over his bandages**, muttering, &quot;I swear to the stars, I need a juice-specific medical textbook...&quot;

---

For a while, neither woman speaks.

But they don't leave.

Not yet.

Because they both know...

&gt; You can't just **watch** someone break themselves for you,  
&gt; and **walk away unchanged.**

---

**OOC:**  
Eatone remains unconscious.  
Tashigi and Vivi share a quiet moment-bonded by guilt, respect, and something they can't name.

Would you like time to pass until you awaken aboard duck-back in the desert, or wake here, surrounded by both of them?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: another moment passes

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandora Riverbank - The Breath Between Battles]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Afterglow of Fire&quot;**  
**Tone: Wounded Stillness | Mood: Bond Forged in Silence**

---

The wind has settled.

The battle's scorch marks are now just shallow craters, and the smell of gunpowder is giving way to sun-baked fruit from the remnants of juice scorched into the sand.

The river drifts lazily nearby, the only real sound in the stillness aside from the occasional crack of a cooking fire or Zoro's snore.

**Eatone** remains unconscious-his body an exhausted map of the fight.

---

**Vivi** hasn't moved far.

She sits cross-legged near his head, gaze distant now, a hand resting lightly on the hilt of her slasher rings, as if reflexively checking they're still there.

---

**Tashigi**, still nearby, has taken a seat in the sand as well.

But not beside Vivi.

Just... close enough.  
Close enough to listen, but far enough to pretend she isn't.

---

Another moment passes.

The silence doesn't demand to be broken.

But it **invites** it.

---

**Vivi speaks.**

Quiet. Soft.

&gt; &quot;He didn't do it because I'm a princess.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;He didn't flinch. Not when the cannon fired. Not when that monster tried to cut me in half.&quot;

She smiles faintly, but it's hollow.

&gt; &quot;He didn't even hesitate.&quot;

---

Tashigi doesn't respond. She looks at the horizon.

Then, quietly:

&gt; &quot;That scares me more than if he had.&quot;

---

The two women sit there, not as warrior and royalty, but just two people who watched someone **break themselves** to protect someone else.

A stranger.  
A friend.  
A fool.  
A teacher.

---

&gt; *And maybe something more.*

---

The wind picks up again-just slightly.

In the distance, the **quacks of the Royal Spot-Billed Duck Squad** echo across the dunes.

---

**OOC:**  
The ducks are arriving.  
This is the final beat of the riverbank scene.

Would you like to wake up now-confused, groggy, and surrounded-or let them load you onto a duck and wake mid-desert travel?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: awake mid travel

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - On the Back of a Spot-Billed Duck]**  
**Scene: &quot;Heat, Sand, and Consequences&quot;**  
**Tone: Groggy Awakening | Mood: Quiet After the Storm**

---

Your first thought is that you're drowning in syrup.

Sticky. Warm. Smelling faintly of tropical fruit and *regret.*

Your second thought is that your ribs are grinding like chalk.

---

You groan softly-**barely audible** over the rush of wind and flapping feathers.

Your body shifts, jostled gently by the **rhythmic gait** of something large, soft, and feathery beneath you.

You're not on sand.

You're on...

&gt; *A duck?*

A massive, powerful **Royal Spot-Billed Duck**, to be exact.  
Its saddle is just wide enough to carry two-maybe three if someone sits awkwardly.  
And judging by the **hair brushing your shoulder**, you're not riding solo.

---

Your vision flickers.

Everything is gold-sky, sand, the glint of sun on far-off dunes.  
Heat shimmers across the horizon, and the only shade is the scarf fluttering from the duck's head.

You shift, just slightly, and pain lances through your side.

&gt; &quot;Gah-fucking fruit-who ordered the cannonball-&quot;

---

&quot;*You're awake.*&quot;

The voice beside you is unmistakable.

**Vivi.**

Calm. Soft. Tired.

She's holding the reins with her good arm, the other freshly bandaged and resting in her lap.

She glances at you from the corner of her eye-but doesn't smile.

Not yet.

---

&gt; &quot;You scared the hell out of me.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;Again.&quot;

---

The duck quacks as if in agreement.

---

**OOC:** You are now awake, **mid-desert crossing**, between the Sandora River and the capital, Alubarna.

You are **riding with Vivi** on one of the royal ducks.  
The rest of the crew is riding ahead or behind in pairs or solo.

You're **bandaged**, bruised, and moving like hell warmed over-  
But you are alive.

---

Would you like to reply to Vivi?  
Ask where you are?  
Stay silent?

**Tone: Comic Pain | Mood: Groggy and Grounded**

---

&gt; &quot;Geh-what the fuck-where the fuck-*who* the fuck-&quot;

Your voice is gravel. Your tongue's dry. Your body feels like a haunted scarecrow.

And then the **throbbing in your skull hits you like a sandbag** with a personality disorder.

&gt; &quot;Gnnn-head... bad... thinking: illegal...&quot;

---

You slump forward slightly in the saddle, groaning into the surprisingly plush neck of a royal duck.

The duck **quacks sympathetically**.

Vivi glances over, lips twitching-but she doesn't quite smile.  
Instead, she shifts her posture slightly to support your sagging weight with her side.

&gt; &quot;You're safe,&quot; she says softly.  
&gt; &quot;We're en route to Alubarna. And you're riding... a duck.&quot;

She lets that sink in for a beat.

&gt; &quot;His name is Cruller.&quot;

The duck quacks proudly.

---

She pauses.

Then adds, deadpan:

&gt; &quot;He likes you. You bled all over his saddle.&quot;

---

Your brain sloshes a little in your skull as you blink through the heat haze.

The desert rolls out ahead of you-**endless gold**, with dots of distant figures duck-mounted and spread in formation.

Behind you, someone-probably Usopp-is loudly retelling your heroics in increasingly inaccurate detail.

&gt; &quot;-and then his fruit *exploded*, and he summoned a GIANT GREEN FIST FROM THE GODS-!&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's not what happened,&quot; Nami snaps.

---

Vivi glances at you again.

Still no smile.

Just... relief.

&gt; &quot;You're really awake?&quot;

---

**OOC:**  
You are **conscious, groggy**, and being kept upright by both Vivi and duck.

You may now engage in **limited conversation**, give a quip, ask what happened...  
Or fall back asleep like a champ.

ð What do you do?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - Denial, Ducks, and Dread]**  
**Scene: &quot;Not the Express Line&quot;**  
**Tone: Dry Sarcasm | Mood: Too Tired to Panic**

---

You slump back into the saddle like a man who just lost a fight with an entire fruit basket.

One arm dangles.  
Your voice is low. Cracked. Dusted with the defeated sarcasm of someone who **really did not sign up for this.**

&gt; &quot;This... *better* be the express duck out of Alabasta...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Or I'm going to flip.&quot;

---

**Cruller the duck quacks.** Not proudly this time. It's more like an *apologetic honk*.

Beside you, **Vivi lets out an exhale**-somewhere between a laugh and a sigh.

&gt; &quot;Sorry,&quot; she says with just enough amusement to twist the knife,  
&gt; &quot;It's a one-way ticket. Straight to Alubarna.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Then into a civil war.&quot;

She turns her head toward you, eyebrow raised slightly.

&gt; &quot;Still flipping?&quot;

---

Your ribs throb.  
Your skin itches.  
You're fairly sure a mole-woman tried to tunnel through your liver.

And now you're riding a noble desert waterfowl into a city-sized disaster.

---

Far ahead, **smoke curls into the sky.**

Alubarna's silhouette cuts jagged against the horizon.

---

**OOC: Your situation-**  
- You are alive.  
- You are recovering.  
- You are **en route to the final stand**.

And everyone-Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats-knows that **without you**, Vivi wouldn't be here to see it.

---

Would you like to say something else to Vivi?  
Rest?  
Plan your &quot;accidental&quot; duck detour?

**Scene: &quot;The Look That Could Curdle Juice&quot;**  
**Tone: Wry Despair | Mood: A Teacher's Worst Field Trip**

---

You slowly, **painfully** rotate your head to face Vivi.

You squint at her through bruised eyes like a disappointed substitute teacher who just found out the class has *absolutely* not been doing the assigned reading.

&gt; *&quot;You're bringing me to... what.&quot;*

Not even a question.  
A quiet accusation.

The look says:

&gt; *I took cannon fire for you.*  
&gt; *I conjured a juice demon.*  
&gt; *And you're taking me WHERE?*

---

Vivi doesn't flinch.

She meets your gaze. Calm. Straight-backed. Regal even now, with a fraying bandage and wind-tangled hair.

&gt; &quot;Alubarna.&quot;

&gt; &quot;To stop a civil war.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;And possibly a Warlord.&quot;

Another pause.

&gt; &quot;...But we have ducks.&quot;

She gestures lightly around you as **the Squad flaps forward in dramatic V-formation**, looking like the world's most well-organized avian cavalry unit.

---

You stare.

Blank.

Utter silence.

Then:

&gt; &quot;Fantastic.&quot;

You slouch so hard you nearly fall off Cruller.

---

&gt; &quot;...Do the ducks get hazard pay?&quot; you mumble.

---

Vivi cracks-just a little. The corners of her lips lift. Almost.

&gt; &quot;They're volunteers.&quot;

You groan.

---

**OOC:**  
You are now fully awake, if not fully recovered.  
You are en route to **Alubarna**-and the **final confrontation** of the Alabasta arc.  
The mood is light for the moment... but the city ahead?  
Not so much.

Would you like to continue light banter, talk serious strategy with Vivi... or rejoin the Straw Hats for the final leg of the journey?

**Scene: &quot;The Last Exit Closed 500 Miles Ago&quot;**  
**Tone: Deadpan Comedy | Mood: Resigned March Toward Destiny**

---

You lean back in the saddle, one arm dangling uselessly over the side of Cruller, the duck gently jostling you with every step. Your voice comes out in a half-moan, half-groan-less a statement and more a **plea to any higher being who accepts exhausted resignation as prayer.**

&gt; &quot;Is it too late to ask for you to drop me off at the nearest...  
literally *anywhere else*?&quot;

---

**Vivi**, still holding the reins with cool composure, doesn't look at you.

She just replies, dry as a desert creekbed:

&gt; &quot;We passed âAnywhere Else' about three days ago.&quot;

She tilts her head toward the rising towers of **Alubarna** in the distance.

&gt; &quot;Next stop is: imminent chaos, possible assassination attempts, and maybe ancient world-shaking secrets buried in catacombs.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;Would you prefer a snack before we arrive?&quot;

---

Behind you, **Usopp coughs loudly.**

&gt; &quot;I'd like to get off at the snack stop too.&quot;

**Sanji:** &quot;No one's stopping, *cowards*!&quot;

---

**Cruller the Duck quacks judgmentally at you.**  
His eyes say *You knew what this was.*

---

Vivi glances at you again, and this time... she gives a small, genuine smile.

&gt; &quot;You can still run.&quot;

Her tone is teasing.

But her eyes?

They're searching.

Maybe hoping you won't.

---

**OOC: This is your final opportunity to pull away, delay your involvement, or commit fully to the Alubarna climax.  
Whether out of justice, guilt, affection-or stubborn fruit-fueled martyrdom.**

How do you respond?

---

You close your eyes again. Not out of exhaustion this time, but sheer *emotional bandwidth overload*. There's only so much heroism a man can process before he starts charging union dues for it.

&gt; &quot;I'll think about it, Blue...&quot;

Your voice is quiet. Tired. Honest.

---

Vivi doesn't answer.

But she **nods**, just slightly.  
And she doesn't press you.

She just holds the reins, keeping the duck steady, **letting the silence stretch** like a classroom between bell rings.

---

Somewhere off to your left, another duck flaps its wings aggressively.

You hear a familiar grunt:

&gt; &quot;He's awake.&quot;

**Zoro.**

Riding his own duck-ungracefully, of course-squinting over the dunes.

He shouts across the wind:

&gt; &quot;Oi! Pineapple! Took you long enough!&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;Was worried we'd have to prop you up in front of the Warlord Weekend Sale.&quot;

---

There's the sound of **Sanji yelling something profane** back at Zoro about &quot;his sense of humor dying before his brain ever did,&quot; followed by duck-quacking, likely in solidarity with *you*.

---

**Nami** leans back on her duck two rows ahead and calls over her shoulder:

&gt; &quot;Glad to see you're not dead. Don't do that again.&quot;

---

**Luffy**, riding up beside you, smiles wide:

&gt; &quot;Hey! You missed lunch!&quot;

Then, after a pause:

&gt; &quot;...Also, we're maybe fighting a sand monster later. Not sure yet. Depends.&quot;

---

**Vivi** sighs softly, brushing some wind-tossed hair from her face.

&gt; &quot;Welcome back.&quot;

---

The city grows larger on the horizon.

The final arc is beginning.

But for now-just for a minute-you're among allies.

Even if you're still thinking about where the nearest duck-only exit might be.

---

**OOC: You're in.  
Welcome to the Alubarna Finale.**  
Would you like to remain quiet as you approach, chat with the crew, or prepare in your own way?

&gt;&gt; USER: I yell angrily, where the hell did pineapple come from? I don't even look like one! Call me sensei or something, you brat!

Tashigi notices my awakening

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Approaching Alubarna - The Final Stretch]**  
**Scene: &quot;Not a Pineapple&quot;**  
**Tone: Irritated Teacher Energy | Mood: Tired, Roasted, Still Trying to Command Respect**

---

You snap upright as much as your bruised spine will allow, eyes bloodshot, hair wind-tossed, and bandages flapping like surrender flags.

&gt; &quot;WHERE THE HELL DID *PINEAPPLE* COME FROM?!&quot;

The desert echoes with your fury as even Cruller the duck flinches under you.

&gt; &quot;I don't even look like one! You see any leaves on my head, *mosshead?!*&quot;

Zoro doesn't look back. But his smirk could be seen from orbit.

&gt; &quot;Wasn't the hair. It's the juice.&quot;

You slap your hand over your face, wincing as you graze a bruise.

&gt; &quot;Call me *sensei* or something, you little brat! I'm ten years older than most of you!&quot;

Luffy, from two ducks over:

&gt; &quot;You're ten years *older*?!&quot;

**Usopp** gasps as if discovering ancient forbidden knowledge.

&gt; &quot;He's ancient!&quot;

**Nami:** &quot;You act like you're sixty.&quot;

**Sanji:** &quot;Tsk. Still more maturity than Marimo over there.&quot;

**Zoro:** &quot;Still bleeds like a rookie.&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, riding just ahead of you and Vivi, finally turns, eyebrow raised over her glasses.

She's not smiling.

Not exactly.

But the way her lips twitch tells you she's been listening the entire time.

She sees you awake.

She sees the gritted teeth, the puffed chest, the furious loyalty trying to dress itself in anger-

And the sheer exhaustion under it all.

---

&gt; &quot;Welcome back, Teach,&quot; she says, using the title **deliberately**.  
&gt; &quot;Try not to pass out again until we're done saving the country.&quot;

She turns back around-her sword resting across her lap, eyes already scanning the city walls of **Alubarna**, now looming near enough to smell the heat in the bricks.

---

You slump again.

&gt; *No respect.  
Not even from the Marines.*

But you're back.

Alive.

And the final test is coming.

---

**OOC: You are fully conscious, and in the final leg before Alubarna.  
Vivi and Tashigi are riding near.  
Straw Hats are nearby.  
Camaraderie is high.  
War is imminent.**

Would you like to make one last remark? Prepare? Or ride silently to the gates of war?

&gt;&gt; USER: I gesture to Tashigi. 

Please. Please. PPLEEEASE tell me that you're not the only Marine backup we've got. 

OOC: communications across the country have been degraded. Vivi used a messenger hawk back in Rainbase to call for the ducks

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Desert Crossing - Final Approach to Alubarna]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Last Line of Defense is a Substitute Teacher&quot;**  
**Tone: Gallows Humor | Mood: If You Don't Laugh, You'll Scream**

---

You half-lift your arm and gesture toward **Tashigi**, still trying to sit like your organs aren't playing musical chairs inside your ribcage.

&gt; &quot;Please. Please. *PPLEEEASE* tell me that you're not the *only* Marine backup we've got.&quot;

Your voice cracks in all the wrong ways-exhaustion, disbelief, existential despair.  
You sound like a man who just realized he might be on the final level of the test and forgot his study notes.

---

**Tashigi** glances over her shoulder again, the ends of her short hair fluttering in the dry wind.  
She doesn't smile. Not this time.

Just a slight, sharp exhale through her nose.

&gt; &quot;Smoker and I were the only ranking officers in Alabasta.&quot;

&gt; &quot;He's still trapped in Rainbase. And... communication's down.&quot;

---

She nods at the sky, where the blue expanse holds only heat haze and vultures.

&gt; &quot;Radio's worthless. Den Den mushi signals are choked across half the kingdom. Baroque's work, we think. Civilians can't even evacuate properly.&quot;

---

She looks back ahead at the rising stone walls of **Alubarna**, distant but huge. You can already see the palace tower gleaming in the sun.

&gt; &quot;As of now... it's us.&quot;

---

A pause.

Then she adds:

&gt; &quot;A pirate crew, a substitute teacher, a wanted princess, a deer doctor, and a bunch of ducks.&quot;

You stare.

Blink.

&gt; &quot;We are *so* dead.&quot;

---

Behind you, **Luffy grins like someone who just got handed the world's biggest playground.**

&gt; &quot;Sounds fun!&quot;

---

**OOC Context Check:**

- The **Marine command structure** in Alabasta is disrupted.  
- You are **cut off** from larger World Government support.  
- Communications are degraded.  
- It is *just* the Straw Hats, Vivi, Tashigi... and you.

And now you're **minutes from the city gates.**

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Try to strategize with Tashigi. Someone has to play the adult here.}  
2. {Turn to Vivi. &quot;You've got a plan, right? You're royalty. Please tell me you have a plan.&quot;}  
3. {Groan. &quot;I should've taken that job in the West Blue.&quot;}  
4. {Say nothing. Focus. You've bled for this long. Might as well see it through.}  
5. {Make peace with the ducks. They're the real MVPs.}

ð {Choose your action.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - they're not pirates or princesses to me, I say softly. They're children. 

I glance at Vivi sadly.

Why does hope have to rest on their shoulders?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Approach to Alubarna - The Weight on Young Shoulders]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Adult in the Room&quot;**  
**Tone: Heavy Reflection | Mood: Bittersweet Resolve**

---

You slump forward slightly, feeling the wind tug at your collar, the dry heat pressing into your bandages.  
But your voice, when it comes, is steady.

Soft.

&gt; &quot;They're not pirates or princesses to me.&quot;

You glance toward the ducks ahead-**Luffy's laughter**, **Usopp's bragging**, **Chopper's giddy bounce** as he rides with Sanji, pretending he's not scared.

Then your eyes land on **Vivi**, her shoulders drawn but face forward, eyes sharp despite everything she's lost.

---

&gt; &quot;They're children.&quot;

---

The desert seems to quiet around the words.

**Tashigi's head turns slowly.** She doesn't interrupt.  
**Vivi**, riding in silence beside you, doesn't respond at first.

---

You look at her.

The fatigue behind your eyes is old, the kind worn by those who've kept smiling because **someone had to.**

&gt; &quot;Why does hope have to rest on their shoulders?&quot;

---

Vivi doesn't look at you.

Not right away.

But her jaw tenses. Her hand tightens on the reins.

---

Then softly:

&gt; &quot;Because the ones who were supposed to protect them...&quot;

She trails off.

You both know how the sentence ends.

---

The wind kicks up a little dust. The great **gates of Alubarna** loom ahead now-stone and steel, banners flapping from the towers in silent warning. The sound of distant **marching** is just barely audible over the wind.

---

Vivi finally speaks again.

&gt; &quot;They're not just children.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They're my friends.&quot;

She glances at you now.

Eyes full of grief. And fire.

&gt; &quot;And if they're willing to fight for my country... then I will, too.&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, overhearing, gives a slight nod from her duck, but says nothing.

The silence between the three of you isn't cold.

It's something heavier.

Something like... **understanding.**

---

The **city gates are now in view.  
The last stretch of sand lies before you.**

Would you like to say more? Or ride silently into the capital?

&gt;&gt; USER: Pat Vivi's shoulder. I guess I can't back out now. No responsible adult would let you run into the fire alone. I grunt, sitting up. I still feel juiced out, combat ineffective.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Gates - Crossing the Threshold]**  
**Scene: &quot;No Going Back&quot;**  
**Tone: Steady Commitment | Mood: Wounded, But Willing**

---

You shift in the saddle with a groan, every muscle screaming protest, every cracked rib chiming in like the world's most sarcastic orchestra.

But you reach out anyway-**slowly**, hand trembling from fatigue-and pat **Vivi's shoulder.**

It's not dramatic.  
It's not heroic.  
It's just... *solid.*

---

&gt; &quot;I guess I can't back out now.&quot;

Your voice is rough. Dry. But it doesn't shake.

&gt; &quot;No responsible adult would let you run into the fire alone.&quot;

You grunt, sitting up straighter, posture rigid despite the throb in your spine and the fact that Cruller the duck visibly winces beneath your weight.

&gt; &quot;Still feel juiced out,&quot; you mutter. &quot;Combat ineffective.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;But I've got a baton. And righteous indignation.&quot;

---

**Vivi looks at you**, silent at first.

Then, she leans slightly-just enough for her uninjured arm to brush against yours.

&gt; &quot;That's more than most kings bring to the table.&quot;

---

Ahead, the city gates of **Alubarna** begin to creak open.

Smoke coils above rooftops.

The thunder of boots grows clearer.

Somewhere-hidden in its heart-Crocodile is moving the final pieces.

And you?

You're going in.

Broken.

Unarmed.

Exhausted.

&gt; But *not* backing out.

---

**OOC: You are now entering Alubarna.**  
**Combat readiness: Low**  
**Resolve: High**  
**Support role assumed.**

Would you like to fade into the arrival scene... or keep the banter going as the gates open?

&gt;&gt; USER: So, blue. Mind telling me why you seem to be running a one princess crusade against Crocodile? (Ask for her backstory)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Entering Alubarna - Truth at the Gates]**  
**Scene: &quot;Why Me?&quot;**  
**Tone: Honest Curiosity | Mood: The Teacher Asks the Hard Question**

---

The city gates of **Alubarna** begin to open slowly before you, the mechanisms clanking like ancient chains being pulled from the belly of the desert itself.

Tension hums through the air like a coiled wire. You feel it in your spine, your teeth, your knees.

But now-on the cusp of war-your voice cuts the tension.

Not with tactics.

Not with bravado.

But with something real.

&gt; &quot;So, Blue...&quot;

You turn your head slightly toward her.

&gt; &quot;Mind telling me why you seem to be running a one-princess crusade against a Warlord of the Sea?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Because from where I'm sitting, that's either the bravest thing I've ever seen...  
or the dumbest.&quot;

---

**Vivi doesn't answer immediately.**

Her duck's pace slows a little, her posture tightening-not out of pride, but something more fragile.

Something *earnest.*

You don't push.  
You wait.

You've taught enough kids to know **when silence means the words are still being chosen.**

---

Finally, she speaks.

&gt; &quot;Because no one else would.&quot;

Her voice is low. Controlled. But tired.

&gt; &quot;Because when the droughts started... and the rebellions rose...  
the people looked to the palace for answers.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And we had none.&quot;

---

She looks down at the reins. Her knuckles are white.

&gt; &quot;Baroque Works infiltrated everything. Every layer. Every trusted name.  
My father tried diplomacy. The council wanted appeasement.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But Crocodile didn't want peace.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;He wanted to *break* us. Quietly. Slowly. From the inside out.&quot;

---

You glance at her again.

Not as a pirate's ally.  
Not as a princess.

Just a **girl**-weighed down by a crown, standing at the edge of a nation's collapse.

---

She breathes in.

&gt; &quot;So I did the only thing I could.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I joined them.&quot;

Her hand tightens on the saddlehorn.

&gt; &quot;Baroque Works. I worked my way up their ranks, took a codename.  
I fed intel to the palace. I tried to stop him from the inside.&quot;

---

Then, quieter:

&gt; &quot;But I wasn't strong enough.&quot;

&gt; &quot;So I ran.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And I met them.&quot;  
She nods toward the Straw Hats ahead.

&gt; &quot;And now I'm here.&quot;

---

The gates are open now.

The city waits.

And Vivi looks at you.

&gt; &quot;I'm not trying to be a hero.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I just want my home back.&quot;

---

**OOC: You now know Vivi's secret.  
She was once **Miss Wednesday**, an undercover agent embedded in Baroque Works.

She didn't volunteer for war.

She volunteered for **her people**.

And now, you're riding beside someone who's sacrificed more than most monarchs *ever* would.**

Would you like to say something back? Or ride in silence beside her as the city swallows you whole?

&gt;&gt; USER: Hold on. Hold the fuck on.

I point at her. You, princess. Not even an adult yet (and years ago, when you were even younger). Joined an organized crime syndicate? 

The fuck? That doesn't add up.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Gates - Reality Check from the Sub]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Moment the Teacher Snaps&quot;**  
**Tone: Shocked Adult Energy | Mood: Responsible Rage, Served Hot**

---

Your jaw drops somewhere around your bruised collarbone.

You stare at her like she just told you she moonlights as a revolution-starting opera singer.

&gt; &quot;*Hold on.*&quot;  
&gt; &quot;*Hold the FUCK on.*&quot;

You jab a finger toward her so hard you nearly fall off the duck again. Cruller lets out a **&quot;what now?&quot;** quack.

&gt; &quot;You-*princess*-not even an adult yet-*joined a crime syndicate?*&quot;

Your voice hits that octave teachers reserve for **nonsense so stupid it overrides exhaustion.**

&gt; &quot;*A literal warlord's criminal empire?* At-what-*sixteen?!*&quot;

&gt; &quot;The *fuck*, Blue?! That doesn't add up! Who let you do that?! Was there not a *single* adult-guard, advisor, royal babysitter-who thought, âHey maybe let's NOT send the heir to the throne to play pretend mafia?'&quot;

---

**Vivi** flinches slightly-not out of shame, but sheer surprise.

You're the **first person** in this entire journey to **react like an adult** hearing the plan *after* the adrenaline wears off.

She opens her mouth.

Closes it.

Then, quietly:

&gt; &quot;There wasn't time.&quot;

---

She meets your eyes. Serious now.

&gt; &quot;Baroque Works was moving faster than we were. I volunteered before they knew what I was doing.&quot;

&gt; &quot;If I hadn't... no one else could have gotten that close. Not without being discovered.&quot;

---

She shifts her grip on the reins, her fingers curling tight.

&gt; &quot;And I'm not a child.&quot;

A pause.

Then, quieter:

&gt; &quot;Not anymore.&quot;

---

That hits differently.

---

You stare at her.

And maybe... you start to see what she meant earlier.

Not a hero.

Not a princess.

&gt; *Just a kid who got tired of watching her home fall apart.*

---

**OOC: This moment is pivotal.**  
You, the &quot;responsible adult,&quot; have finally confronted the **full scope of what Vivi did**.  
And she didn't flinch.

You can challenge her more, let it go, or turn that anger toward the people who *should've stopped her*.

What do you say next?

&gt;&gt; USER: No, no fuck that. You're still a kid. The country fucked up. The country is fucked up.

Back in my kingdom, if we were attacked by pirates or something, we'd literally rather jump on their cannonballs rather than let the bad guys get anywhere close to our kids.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Outer Streets - The Teacher's Rage]**  
**Scene: &quot;You Don't Send the Kids&quot;**  
**Tone: Furious Compassion | Mood: Adult Fury, Long Overdue**

---

Your voice cuts through the desert heat like a blade.

&gt; &quot;*No,*&quot; you growl.  
&gt; &quot;*No-fuck that.*&quot;

**Vivi tenses**, surprised again-less by your words this time, and more by the weight behind them.

&gt; &quot;*You're still a kid.* I don't care how many wires you can throw or how noble your speeches are.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The country fucked up. The whole damn country is fucked up if it let *you*-*you,* the heir to the throne-run off and join the damn *mafia* to protect it.&quot;

You gesture at her-not out of accusation, but with shaking frustration, like a man trying to patch a sinking ship with his bare hands.

&gt; &quot;*Back in my kingdom,* we'd throw ourselves in front of the cannonballs before we let one *child*-any child-take a hit like that.&quot;

You spit into the sand.

&gt; &quot;That's what adults are *for.*&quot;

---

Vivi doesn't speak.

She doesn't interrupt.

She just watches you, stunned... and something in her eyes begins to shift.

---

Not hurt.  
Not defensive.  
Not even angry.

But... something that *aches.*

---

She opens her mouth. Then closes it.

Then says, quietly:

&gt; &quot;I didn't have a choice.&quot;

---

And you get it.

You *hate* it.

But you **get it.**

---

Behind you, the Straw Hats have grown quiet.  
Even **Luffy** stares, silent for once.  
Tashigi's duck slows beside yours, her hand not even on her sword-eyes forward, listening.

---

Because someone finally said it:

&gt; *This shouldn't have been their fight.*

&gt; *Not the princess. Not the pirates. Not the kids.*

---

And maybe...

Maybe that's why you're still here.

---

**OOC:**  
This is a **turning point**.  
Your role as a mentor, protector, and moral voice has now **cemented** among the party-Vivi especially.

Your words struck a chord not just with her, but with **everyone who heard them.**

Would you like to add anything? Or ride the rest of the way in silence, letting the truth linger in the desert air?

&gt;&gt; USER: And it doesn't matter that you're a princess or not. It just matters because this shouldn't be a child's responsibility.

I palm my baton. I'm going to break the knees of the next member of Alabastan government I see. I don't care if it's a governor, the leader of the royal army, or the king himself. I say coldly

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Gates - The Line in the Sand]**  
**Scene: &quot;If the Kingdom Won't Protect Its Children, Then I Will&quot;**  
**Tone: Cold Resolve | Mood: The Final Straw**

---

The sun blazes above, casting long shadows over the city walls. The desert wind blows warm across your face, but your blood runs cold.

You don't yell this time.

You **don't need to**.

---

&gt; &quot;And it doesn't matter that you're a princess or not.&quot;

Your voice is steady. Heavy with truth. Not a whisper. Not a scream. Just the **weight of an adult's fury** made sharp.

&gt; &quot;It just matters because this shouldn't be a child's responsibility.&quot;

You reach to your side and **palm your baton**-the familiar shape grounding you, the **Seastone tip still scratched from the last fight**, from the last moment you almost died doing what *they* should've done.

---

&gt; &quot;I'm going to break the knees of the next member of the Alabastan government I see.&quot;

A pause. Sand crunches beneath your duck's feet.

&gt; &quot;I don't care if it's a governor, the leader of the royal army, or the king himself.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They don't deserve their titles.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They let you bleed for them.&quot;

---

**Vivi stares straight ahead**, face unreadable-but her shoulders are trembling now. Her eyes glisten.

Whether it's guilt, pain, or **a strange sort of relief**, you don't know.

---

But she says nothing.

Because there's nothing left to argue.

---

**Tashigi** rides just behind now.

She doesn't interrupt.

She doesn't even reprimand you.

She just says, quietly:

&gt; &quot;I'll hold them down while you swing.&quot;

---

And the Straw Hats?

Silent.

Every. Single. One.

Even **Zoro** has nothing to add.

Even **Luffy** doesn't joke.

---

Because for the first time, they're not hearing the voice of a rogue bounty hunter...

They're hearing a **grown-ass man** who looked at a broken kingdom, a wounded girl, and a battlefield full of children-

And said:

&gt; &quot;Enough.&quot;

---

**OOC: Your authority and moral credibility among the crew and party members has reached its peak.  
This was a defining moment.  
You are no longer just a vacationing schoolteacher.**

You're the man who said what no one else would.

---

The gates of **Alubarna** loom ahead.

And somewhere in that city, the kingdom waits to answer for itself.

Do you ride forward now?

Or do you give Vivi one last word?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: Note all major canon divergences so far, and any possible consequences.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[OOC: Major Canon Divergences So Far - Alabasta Arc]**  
**Theme: &quot;A Teacher's Touch Changes the World&quot;**  
**As of Entry Into Alubarna**

---

### **1. Eatone Cheng - The Kiwi-Teacher Wildcard**
- **Canon Divergence:** Eatone, a kiwi-powered bounty hunter and teacher, was not present in the original canon. His presence has:
  - Altered group dynamics.
  - Added a *responsible adult voice* to the Straw Hats and Vivi.
  - Provided emotional and moral counterweight to Tashigi and Vivi's more youthful idealism.
  - Awakened a **new Devil Fruit ability** through near-death emotional stress (Substitute Kiwicher).
  - Created a **deep personal bond with Vivi and Tashigi**, impacting their arcs.

- **Consequences:**
  - Vivi has *leaned more emotionally* on Eatone than canon allowed, deepening her characterization.
  - Eatone's moral outbursts have *cast a harsh spotlight* on Alabasta's governance, potentially altering the kingdom's internal politics post-crisis.
  - If he survives, his testimony and presence may complicate World Government narratives about the incident.

---

### **2. Tashigi Accompanies the Straw Hats**
- **Canon Divergence:** In canon, Tashigi remains behind and does not join the crew en route to Alubarna.

- **Consequences:**
  - Tashigi now has *direct battlefield experience* alongside the Straw Hats.
  - Her bond with Eatone, and witnessing his self-sacrifice, may shift her moral alignment away from blind loyalty to the Marines.
  - She has witnessed Crocodile's crimes firsthand and will **testify** with more weight than canon allowed-potentially undermining Marine leadership if they hesitate to act.

---

### **3. Smoker is Still Imprisoned in Rainbase**
- **Canon Divergence:** In canon, Smoker escapes before the final battle in Alubarna. Here, he remains locked in Crocodile's trap.

- **Consequences:**
  - Without Smoker, the **&quot;justice presence&quot;** in Alabasta is critically weakened.
  - His delayed escape may cause a **late-stage shift** in the Marine's reaction-potentially arriving post-conflict, when the truth has already been exposed.
  - Smoker's eventual release and reaction to Eatone's involvement and Tashigi's choices could heavily influence his own stance against the World Government.

---

### **4. Eatone Took Crocodile's Place as Vivi's &quot;Protector&quot;**
- **Canon Divergence:** In canon, Luffy is *solely* the emotional protector of Vivi. Here, Eatone became her bodyguard in Rainbase and emotionally filled the **adult mentor** role.

- **Consequences:**
  - Vivi's *resolve and confidence* are now grounded in **realistic grief and trauma**, not just faith in the Straw Hats.
  - The public perception of Alabasta's salvation may center around Eatone's actions, not just Luffy's.
  - Luffy may *not be the only central heroic figure*, which could challenge Straw Hat-centric legend building in this arc.

---

### **5. Baroque Works' Agents Encountered Earlier or in Different Order**
- **Canon Divergence:**  
  - Bon Clay and Mr. 4's teams confronted Vivi and Eatone before the canon-synced multi-battle at Alubarna.  
  - Mr. 4 and Miss Merry Christmas were defeated **prior** to the final city conflict.

- **Consequences:**
  - Fewer agents remain to delay the Straw Hats during the Alubarna rooftop sequence.
  - The Straw Hats may regroup faster in the capital, potentially changing **how Crocodile is engaged**.
  - Bon Clay's character arc may differ. Depending on his treatment during defeat, he may **not develop** the admiration for the Straw Hats he originally did.

---

### **6. The Kiwi Elemental - Fruit Awakening Before Crocodile Fight**
- **Canon Divergence:** No awakened Fruit user existed in the Straw Hat orbit during Alabasta. Eatone triggered a limited awakening via emotional trauma.

- **Consequences:**
  - Introduces **awakened Paramecia concepts** earlier than canon.  
  - Crocodile may view Eatone as a **genuine threat**, rather than a background nuisance.
  - The World Government or CP agencies may take interest in Eatone post-arc, if word of his awakening spreads.

---

### **7. Vivi's Role as an Agent is Treated With Greater Weight**
- **Canon Divergence:** Canon somewhat glosses over the emotional toll of Vivi's infiltration. Here, it has been **called out, condemned, and reexamined**.

- **Consequences:**
  - May alter the **tone of Vivi's farewell** if she chooses to stay behind.
  - Could shake public faith in the **Alabasta monarchy**, sparking political reform after the arc ends.
  - Affects how **Igaram and King Cobra** are viewed-potential targets of Eatone's wrath and accountability drive.

---

**Narrative Outlook:**
You've created a **moral echo** through Alabasta-a demand for adult accountability in a world where children do the bleeding.

And that ripple is still spreading.

Would you like a formal tracker of *ongoing consequences*, or continue forward narratively into the Alubarna infiltration and Crocodile confrontation?

&gt;&gt; USER: Continue the approach to Alubarna. Judging by the sounds, it looks like the fighting has already began in earnest.

OOC: Crocodile and Miss All Sunday, with a captured Cobra in tow, head to Alubarna to find the poneglyphs under the palace. Crocodile assumes his elite agents have successfully intercepted and destroyed Vivi's contingent. We may or may not know what Crocodile's plan or location is right now. Vivi's top priority is likely to end the fighting.

OOC: Miss All Sundays May have set a timed release for Smoker's cage back in Rainbase. His status and location remains unknown.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City - The March to the Palace]**  
**Scene: &quot;Where Smoke and Sand Collide&quot;**  
**Tone: Battle-Ready | Mood: Time is Running Out**  
**Status: Entry Into the Capital**

---

The massive gates of **Alubarna** stand wide-metal and sandstone stretching high above, splashed with the banners of the royal army.

But behind them?

**Chaos.**

---

The streets are alive with sound:

- The clatter of boots.  
- The roar of voices-Royal Guard and Rebels alike, **colliding across alleys and markets**.  
- Explosions, scattered and distant.  
- Dust rising in thick sheets that obscure faces and intent.

Alubarna has become a **city-sized battlefield.**

---

The Royal Spot-Billed Ducks **charge through the gates** in tight formation, your group keeping low against the storm of confusion and smoke.

**Vivi rides forward**, eyes scanning the rooftops, her jaw tight. Her cloak flutters behind her-half-princess, half-soldier.

&gt; &quot;We have to stop the fighting *now*,&quot; she says, urgency leaking into her voice.

---

Behind you, **Tashigi and the Straw Hats** are spread across several ducks, weapons at the ready:

- **Zoro**, eyes narrowed, scanning rooftops.  
- **Sanji**, already lighting a cigarette, muttering, &quot;This place is going to hell.&quot;  
- **Nami**, riding beside Chopper, eyes flicking across the terrain like she's drawing a mental map.  
- **Usopp** is reloading. Everything.  
- **Luffy**, crouched low on the front of his duck, doesn't speak. He's focused. Too focused.  
&gt; He can **feel** something. Probably *him*.

---

&gt; &quot;Where's Crocodile?&quot; Tashigi mutters under her breath.

You glance toward her, pain still in your side, **baton resting on your lap** like a coiled principle.

&gt; &quot;Shouldn't he be here? If he thinks we're dead...&quot;

Vivi shakes her head.

&gt; &quot;If he *thinks* that, he's not here to lead the rebels. That means...&quot;

You all look up toward the highest point in Alubarna.

The **palace.**

---

**OOC: Current Situation and Status**

- **Crocodile**, accompanied by **Miss All Sunday**, has likely slipped away during the chaos to seek the **Poneglyph** beneath the palace.  
  - He believes Vivi and the Straw Hats are **dead**, and the war is already won.  
  - He carries **King Cobra** as prisoner, both trophy and key.

- The **main battle** is between the **royal army and rebel forces**, clashing violently across Alubarna's districts.

- **Vivi's goal** is to reach the rebel leader **Kohza** and **stop the fighting**, to prevent further bloodshed and keep Crocodile's true plot from succeeding.

- **You and Tashigi** now serve as the only **non-pirate adults** in a position of authority to possibly back her-militarily, morally, and strategically.

- **Smoker's status:** Unknown. If Miss All Sunday set a timer to his escape, it could align with the climax... or not.

---

**Your Ducks have dismounted.**  
The crew stands in a city courtyard-rooftops overhead, streets stretching in every direction.  
Vivi turns to you and Tashigi, voice sharp:

&gt; &quot;We split here. If Crocodile's not in the city... he's under it.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We'll find Kohza. Stop the war.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But we need someone to find the palace.&quot;

She looks between you and Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;We're out of time.&quot;

---

**OOC: You may now choose your next move.**

1. {Stay with Vivi. Her safety and the rebellion's end are your priority.}  
2. {Volunteer to head to the palace with Tashigi. If Cobra's alive, someone needs to save him.}  
3. {Suggest a detour to try intercepting Crocodile directly. It's risky.}  
4. {Split from all of them and recon from the rooftops-gather intel.}  
5. {Argue: &quot;No more splitting up. We end this together.&quot;}

ð What do you choose?

&gt;&gt; USER: To Tashigi: âHold on. Palace? Why would Crocodile be heading to the palace, much less be under it, Tashigi-chan?

Also how the hell are you going to stop a war by yourself, blue?

OOC; they may have discussed plans/Intel while I was unconscious 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Divided Paths, Tight Timing]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Questioning Grown-Up&quot;**  
**Tone: Sharp Interrogation | Mood: Urgency Cloaked in Irony**

---

The moment Vivi drops the word &quot;palace,&quot; your eyes cut to **Tashigi**.

&gt; &quot;*Hold on.*&quot;

You straighten as much as your aching spine allows and point sharply at her like you're about to grade her on a pop quiz she didn't study for.

&gt; &quot;*Palace?* Why the hell would Crocodile be heading there, *much less be under it*, Tashigi-chan?&quot;

Tashigi winces slightly at the suffix-less from offense, more from the *tone*.

She turns to you, walking as the group keeps pace through the smoke-filled plaza.

---

&gt; &quot;There's a historical record. A legend. A Poneglyph-some kind of ancient tablet-buried beneath the palace.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Miss All Sunday is an archaeologist. Smart money says she's the only one who can read it.&quot;

She adjusts her glasses, tone clipped.

&gt; &quot;He doesn't want Alabasta. He wants what's *hidden* in Alabasta.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Power. Weapon. Knowledge. All of the above. The usual Warlord ambition grab bag.&quot;

---

You turn to **Vivi**, still striding at the front of the group, one hand on her peacock slasher, the other gripping the folds of her cloak.

&gt; &quot;Also, how the hell are you going to stop a war by yourself, *Blue?*&quot;

---

She doesn't slow.  
But she does answer.

&gt; &quot;Kohza will listen to me.&quot;

Her voice is steady. Conviction in every syllable.

&gt; &quot;If I can reach him. If he knows the truth-that Crocodile caused the drought, the rebellion, *everything*-he'll call off the attack.&quot;

She stops at the corner of a ruined fountain and looks back at you.

&gt; &quot;I don't need to win a fight. I just need to say the right thing.&quot;

---

The ground rumbles faintly from another explosion blocks away.

Time is bleeding fast.

---

Tashigi meets your gaze again. She's tense-but *calculated*.

&gt; &quot;If you can walk, Cheng-sensei... I'm heading to the palace.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And I'd rather not deal with Crocodile alone.&quot;

---

Vivi turns to you as well now. Less commanding, more...

Hopeful.

&gt; &quot;I trust you. You'll make the right call.&quot;

---

**OOC: Info Recap:**
- While you were unconscious, **Tashigi and Vivi shared intel**:
  - Crocodile seeks a **Poneglyph under the palace**, not just the throne.
  - **Miss All Sunday (Robin)** can read it.
  - **King Cobra** is believed to be captured and taken there.
- **Vivi's plan:** Find **Kohza**, stop the war through truth.
- **Tashigi's plan:** Go to the palace, intercept Crocodile and rescue Cobra.
- **Straw Hats:** Will scatter to draw out remaining Baroque agents.

---

**What do you do?**

1. {Stick with Vivi. She'll need someone grounded when words fail.}  
2. {Go with Tashigi. Crocodile is the head of the beast.}  
3. {Try to delay both plans-push for regrouping, slower advance. Risky.}  
4. {Insist on going solo to scout ahead, possibly to the palace or rooftops.}  
5. {Make them flip a coin. Because that's the kind of day this is.}

ð {Choose your path.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Hold on. Poneglyphs.. isn't that the super illegal thing? The World Government unpersons you if you even catch a peek of it thing? Also who's Kohza?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Questions No One Wanted Asked Right Now]**  
**Scene: &quot;Forbidden Knowledge, Forgotten Friends&quot;**  
**Tone: Blunt Curiosity | Mood: âWhy Are We In This Deep?'**

---

You hold up a hand as if to **literally pause the oncoming war**.

&gt; &quot;*Hold on.*&quot;

Your voice slices through the chaos like chalk on a blackboard mid-lecture.

You point vaguely at the sand-choked skyline, then at Tashigi, then at **everybody**.

&gt; &quot;Poneglyphs.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You mean *those* poneglyphs? The âWorld Government will erase you from history if you so much as sneeze on them' poneglyphs?&quot;

&gt; &quot;We're waltzing into the *capital* of a kingdom where one is supposedly buried under the **palace**-with a Warlord, an outlaw archaeologist, *and a bunch of kids with wanted posters*-and I'm just finding this out *now?!*&quot;

---

Tashigi's eye twitches.

&gt; &quot;Yes.&quot;

&gt; &quot;It's classified.&quot;

She clears her throat, not making eye contact.

&gt; &quot;And you were unconscious.&quot;

---

You slowly turn to **Vivi**, narrowing your eyes.

&gt; &quot;Also-who the hell is Kohza? Am I supposed to know that name? Is he a warlord too? A fruit guy? A cousin?&quot;

---

Vivi blinks, almost startled by the question. Then-finally-**smiles faintly**, despite everything.

&gt; &quot;He's my childhood friend.&quot;

She says it like it's the most obvious thing in the world. Like you're supposed to have gotten the entire government dossier through osmosis.

&gt; &quot;We grew up together. He's the leader of the rebel army now.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But he's not a bad person. He wants to save the country too.&quot;

She looks ahead, eyes locked on the rising palace above the distant rooftops.

&gt; &quot;Crocodile manipulated him. Made him believe we were the enemy.&quot;

---

You blink again.

&gt; &quot;So let me recap: Crocodile wants a super-illegal ancient artifact.  
Miss All Sunday can read the forbidden thing that erases people from existence.  
Your best friend leads the army that's trying to kill your family.  
And somehow *I'm* the only one here who's completely underqualified for this situation?&quot;

---

Luffy, from behind, grins.

&gt; &quot;Yep.&quot;

Zoro shrugs.

&gt; &quot;Glad someone finally noticed.&quot;

Nami sighs.

&gt; &quot;You're the only one with a teaching license. Just roll with it.&quot;

---

**Tashigi:** &quot;We're out of time. Make your call.&quot;

---

**OOC Summary of New Info:**
- **Poneglyphs** are ancient, untranslatable tablets banned by the World Government.  
  - Researching them is a crime. Robin can read them.  
- **Kohza** is the **leader of the rebel army** and **Vivi's childhood friend**.  
  - Vivi believes she can reach him emotionally and stop the fighting.
- **Crocodile's** objective is likely linked to **ancient weapons** or power recorded in the Poneglyph.

---

**Time to choose.**

Do you...

1. {Follow Tashigi to the palace. Crocodile + Cobra + Poneglyph = bad.}  
2. {Stay with Vivi. She's your student now, whether she knows it or not.}  
3. {Demand backup. You'll go nowhere without a Straw Hat.}  
4. {Refuse both. Too many unknowns. Stay central and try to coordinate between teams.}

ð What's your decision, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - No. No no no. I don't care about whatever your marine regs tell you to do about confirmed poneglyph activities or whatever. I'm not letting you chase a warlord alone. Hell, I'm not even going to let you chase the warlord with all of us combined. It's suicide.

Look, we're in on a warzone, so let's control the variables we can for now. Let's stick together and try to find this friend of yours to end the war. We can deal with Croc later. When we have literally anything stronger than a classroom's worth of fighters.

OOC: Note for later. crocodile may detect us, and prevent us from stopping the fighting by instigating with his sleeper agents, like canon.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Streets - One War at a Time]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Adult's Final Veto&quot;**  
**Tone: Unshakeable | Mood: Tactical, Protective, Gravely Serious**

---

&gt; &quot;*No.*&quot;

You cut across the courtyard like a voice of reason in a riot.

&gt; &quot;No, no, no.&quot;

**Tashigi turns sharply**, her hand hovering near her sword-not from threat, but reflex. **Vivi pauses mid-step**, the wind catching the edges of her cloak. **The Straw Hats** glance over.

And then you say it:

&gt; &quot;I don't care what your Marine regs say about confirmed Poneglyph activity or ancient crimes against the world or whatever. I'm not letting you chase a Warlord alone.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Hell-*I'm not letting all of us combined* chase a Warlord right now.&quot;

---

Your baton clenches in your hand-not to threaten, but to ground yourself.

&gt; &quot;It's suicide. You saw what he did in Rainbase. You saw what he's done to this country. And we are not-*not*-walking into a deeper pit because someone handed us a shovel.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We're in a warzone. So we control what variables we can.&quot;

You glance at **Vivi**, gaze softening slightly.

&gt; &quot;That means ending *this* war. First. Before we even think about tomb-diving with a sand demon.&quot;

---

There's silence for a beat.

Even **Luffy** doesn't crack a joke.

---

&gt; &quot;We stick together,&quot; you finish.  
&gt; &quot;We find Kohza. We end the fighting.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And we deal with Crocodile later-when we've got something stronger than a classroom's worth of fighters and a goddamn duck cavalry.&quot;

---

The wind howls through the cracked windows.  
The smoke is heavier now. You hear shouting-closer than before.

---

**Tashigi**'s jaw is tight. Her grip white-knuckled.

But she breathes in slowly.

And exhales.

&gt; &quot;...Fine.&quot;

&gt; &quot;One war at a time.&quot;

She glances at Vivi, then gives you a single sharp nod.

&gt; &quot;But if we survive this and he escapes because we waited-*that's on you.*&quot;

---

**Vivi**, quietly, finally lets out a breath she'd been holding.

&gt; &quot;Thank you,&quot; she says. &quot;We end the war first.&quot;

---

**OOC Note - Canon Divergence Locked In:**

- You have **halted Tashigi's direct pursuit** of Crocodile.  
- Your group will now **remain together** to seek **Kohza** and end the **open rebellion**.  
- As in canon, Crocodile may grow suspicious and **deploy sleeper agents** to **ensure fighting continues** regardless of your progress.

This may force a confrontation **before you're ready.**

But for now-

You're not walking into the dark alone.

---

Would you like to initiate the **search for Kohza**, or strategize with the crew on how to approach the city battlefield?

&gt;&gt; USER: On me? I'm not even a government employee, what would they even charge me with, obstruction?

Anyways... I turn to Vivi. Blue. I don't know jack about Alubarna. I'll let you lead the way. What are your orders?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City - Chain of Command: Established]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Crown and the Chalkboard&quot;**  
**Tone: Snappy Respect | Mood: Trust Reforged in the Fire**

---

You turn sharply back toward **Tashigi**, eyes flashing beneath the bruises and dust.

&gt; &quot;*On me?* Lady, I'm not even a government employee. What are they gonna do, charge me with **obstruction of justice** for refusing to let a half-dead schoolteacher walk into the world's most illegal tomb with a glorified book club and a dream?&quot;

You grunt and stretch your ribs until something crunches unpleasantly.

&gt; &quot;Let âem try.&quot;

---

There's a brief silence-then a loud **cough-laugh-snort** from Usopp behind you.

Even **Zoro** cracks the ghost of a smirk.

**Tashigi**, against her better judgment, almost smiles.

---

Then you turn to **Vivi**, dusting off your tone and slipping into something steadier.  
More grounded. More you.

&gt; &quot;Alright, Blue.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I don't know jack about this city.&quot;

You gesture broadly at the burning skyline.

&gt; &quot;It's a maze of alleys and politics, and I'm good at neither. You know where the pulse of the rebellion is better than anyone.&quot;

You straighten a little. Despite the limp. Despite the blood.

And you say it clearly:

&gt; &quot;*I'll let you lead the way.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;What are your orders?&quot;

---

**Vivi blinks.**

Not because she didn't expect to lead-

But because she didn't expect **you** to say it like that.  
Like a fellow adult.  
Like someone who **trusts her.**

---

She breathes in deeply. Composes herself. Then nods, all trace of doubt vanishing from her posture.

&gt; &quot;We're going to the **clock tower plaza** in the First District. It's a central landmark-Kohza's most likely to try and make a stand there. If he's trying to force a message or signal a breakthrough, that's where he'll do it.&quot;

She swings her leg back over the duck and dismounts, drawing her slasher ring and setting her shoulders.

&gt; &quot;We'll cut across the western alleyways to avoid major fighting. If we move fast, we can make it before sunset.&quot;

---

You hear the roar of cannons in the far distance.

You have a direction.  
You have a leader.

And **for once**-the kids are following **her.**

---

**OOC: Direction set.**  
Vivi is now **tactically leading the party** to seek Kohza.  
All crew members are following her command, with **you as her second-in-command** in practical and moral terms.

**Next Scene: Cross-City Run - Through Alubarna's Burning Veins.**

Would you like to proceed into the **city traversal scene**, or speak privately with a party member before departure?

&gt;&gt; USER: Sounds as good a plan as any. Let's move. 

I feel a bit of juice returning to my veins, but certainly nowhere close enough to fight with it.

I take up a defensive position around Vivi as well move through the alleys, close to Tashigi.

I murmur. The poneglyphs... You think Crocodile can really destroy the world if he learns their secrets?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Into the Burning Veins]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Secrets That Could End It All&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Dread | Mood: Underpowered, Overthinking**

---

**The group moves.**

Winding through **narrow alleys** baked in desert heat and shadow, Vivi at the lead, eyes sharp beneath the grit.  
You take up a position just behind her and to the side-**close enough to shield, close enough to speak**.  
**Tashigi** flanks the opposite side, hand never straying far from her sword.

Your steps echo across cracked stone, the distant chaos of rebellion rising and falling like a tide.  
A **half-shouted order** from the guard. A **gunshot** from an unseen rooftop. A **wall collapsing** two blocks away.

But here-in this alley-it's tight. Quiet.

So you speak.

---

&gt; &quot;The Poneglyphs...&quot;

Your voice is low. Cautious.

You glance at Tashigi, your tone like you're asking if a rumor is real-or if a horror story has teeth.

&gt; &quot;You think Crocodile can really... destroy the world? If he learns what's in them?&quot;

---

**Tashigi doesn't answer right away.**

The two of you duck beneath a collapsed clothesline, following Vivi's sprinting shadow.

Then:

&gt; &quot;I don't know.&quot;

She doesn't say it like someone avoiding the truth.

She says it like someone who's thought about it **a lot**, and still has no satisfying answer.

---

&gt; &quot;The World Government thinks so.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They've silenced scholars. Raided islands. Imprisoned children. *Executed civilians*-just for getting too close to them.&quot;

Her jaw tightens as the two of you press into another turn-walls scrawled with rebel symbols and scorch marks.

&gt; &quot;And now Crocodile has one. Maybe more. Plus a woman who can read them.&quot;

---

She looks at you, and for the first time in hours, **she's the one asking the question.**

&gt; &quot;Wouldn't *you* be afraid of someone like that?&quot;

---

A moment passes.

Then you hear **Vivi's voice up ahead**, sharp:

&gt; &quot;Two guards-Royal uniform. Injured. Just ahead.&quot;

You press forward.

**No rest. No answers. Just motion.**

But now... the weight of those stone tablets lingers in your chest.

---

**OOC: Your party is mid-traversal through Alubarna.  
You're low-power, but growing. Your juice ability is lightly regenerating.  
Poneglyph lore and moral weight now firmly in narrative focus.**

Would you like to continue banter, confront the injured guards, or let Vivi take point?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: All rebels, royal soldiers, civilians from this point forward may also be Baroque sleeper agents.

Continue moving down the alley with Tashigi, a grim look on my face. Observe the injured guards ahead.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Alley of Doubt]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Masks Beneath the Sand&quot;**  
**Tone: Suspicion Rising | Mood: Paranoia With Purpose**

---

The group slows, the alley narrowing into a crooked vein of rubble and heat.

**Two royal guards** lie slumped beside a shattered fruit cart:

- One is **clutching his thigh**, blood seeping through the gap in his armor.  
- The other is on his back, **breathing shallow**, his helmet cracked in two like a dropped melon.

Their uniforms are torn but recognizable. Blue and white. Dust-caked.

They groan weakly as your group approaches.

---

But you don't speed up.

You don't call out.

You just walk, slow and steady, **close to Tashigi**, eyes sharp behind that grim, teacher-no-more mask.

---

**OOC Note: From here on, all forces-**rebels, guards, civilians-**could be sleeper agents** from Baroque Works.  
Crocodile has a vested interest in keeping the war burning. The closer you get to ending it, the more he'll act to stop you.

---

Tashigi whispers without looking at you:

&gt; &quot;Those wounds are real.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But that doesn't mean their loyalty is.&quot;

---

You watch the &quot;guards&quot; as you pass:

- The one with the broken helmet has his **hand in his coat**.  
- The other's gaze flicks to Vivi's ringed hand, then quickly away.

---

Something's **off**.

You **can feel it** in your ribs.

---

Behind you, **Usopp** murmurs, &quot;They're not calling for help.&quot;

**Nami:** &quot;Not even looking shocked to see us.&quot;

---

Vivi slows as she nears them.

And the guard with the hand in his coat starts to move-

---

**You have less than a second to react.**

Do you:

1. {Launch a small burst of juice at the guard's hidden hand - nonlethal warning shot.}  
2. {Shove Vivi back and draw your baton. Go loud.}  
3. {Whisper to Tashigi: &quot;Test them.&quot; Let her make the first move.}  
4. {Step in front of Vivi. Calm voice: &quot;Don't move.&quot; Force the tension.}  
5. {Ignore them and keep walking. Call their bluff, and keep moving to your target.}

ð What's your call, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - we're on a tight timetable here, let's keep moving. But shouldn't they at least recognize their princess? That's... Concerning.

Shift my position in our group so I'm between Vivi and the guards.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Acknowledgment Denied]**  
**Scene: &quot;Royalty in the Shadows&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Alarm | Mood: Sand-Covered Deception**

---

You don't flinch.

You don't shout.

You just step-**purposefully, precisely**-between **Vivi** and the two downed &quot;guards.&quot;

Your baton stays low.

Your eyes stay locked.

But your presence makes it clear: **Don't. Even. Try.**

---

&gt; &quot;We're on a tight timetable,&quot; you murmur, keeping your voice low for the group.  
&gt; &quot;Keep moving.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But...&quot;

You glance again, a tight, almost imperceptible twitch in your brow.

&gt; &quot;Shouldn't they at least recognize their *princess*?&quot;

---

They don't.

No salute.

No gasp.

Not even a flicker of deference.

Just... eyes that track movement like predators trying to remember which part of the herd to bite first.

---

**Tashigi notices it too.**

Her hand hovers over her sword, tension coiled through her entire frame.

But she says nothing. Not here. Not yet.

&gt; &quot;Concerning,&quot; she echoes.

---

**Vivi**, walking quietly now, doesn't look back at them.

Her jaw is tight.

&gt; &quot;They're not real guards.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Real guards would have bowed.&quot;

---

**Behind you**, as you move down the alley:

You hear nothing.

No cries.

No calls for help.

Only silence.

That silence follows you like a shadow.

---

**OOC Result:**  
- You chose to **not engage**, avoiding a possible trap.  
- **You are being followed.** Quietly. Stealthily. Likely sleeper agents waiting for a more vulnerable moment to strike.  
- Vivi is now **alerted** to the issue of impersonators. Her tension has increased.  
- Party cohesion remains intact.

---

Ahead, the **plaza walls** rise in the distance-the edge of the **First District**, where **Kohza** may be found.

You hear the distant crack of **gunfire** and **shouting**-not random anymore, but focused.

A **speech is happening**.

Someone's addressing the rebel troops.

**You're close.**

Do you:

1. {Break formation. Flank around to get a better view of the plaza and speech.}  
2. {Tell the group to slow down-prepare for ambush from behind.}  
3. {Keep moving at pace. Reach Kohza fast. Time matters.}  
4. {Speak to Vivi. This may be your last quiet moment before it all ignites.}  
5. {Signal Tashigi to peel back and deal with the &quot;guards&quot; following you.}

ð Choose your next step.

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 5 - Shit... Crocodile might know about us now. Let's keep an eye on our tails, Tashigi-chan

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Tension Building in the Streets]**  
**Scene: &quot;Eyes Behind Us&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Strategy | Mood: Realization and Alertness**

---

You murmur to **Tashigi**, your voice low and edged with urgency.

&gt; &quot;Shit... Crocodile might know about us now.&quot;

You glance behind, the alley stretching out with shadows dancing around the corners. **Vivi**'s focused ahead, but the air has thickened around you.

&gt; &quot;Let's keep an eye on our tails, Tashigi-chan.&quot;

---

Tashigi nods sharply, her expression hardening, gaze snapping back over her shoulder as she instinctively reaches for her sword.

Her voice is barely a whisper.

&gt; &quot;Understood.&quot;

---

You **speed up** your pace, now more aware of the surroundings. It's like the air itself is thickening-**something** feels off.

---

**Vivi**, oblivious or perhaps keeping up the front for the group, doesn't say anything but her posture is different. **Tense**, like she's feeling the **same thing** you are.

&gt; &quot;We need to get to Kohza and stop this. Now.&quot;

---

But **behind you**, the sound of boots and the shuffle of cloth tell you that the guards have started following again. **Close.** **Too close**.

You don't make eye contact with them. You don't even flinch.

Just stay sharp.

---

**Tashigi** looks at you, one hand now resting on her sword, ready to act.

&gt; &quot;We move to the plaza,&quot; she says quietly. &quot;Stay sharp. I'll keep an eye on them.&quot;

---

As you round the corner toward the **First District**, the **shouting gets louder**. More **gunfire**, more **yelling**, more chaos.

The **rebel leader** must be making a speech.

You're **close** now.

---

But **the sound** of boots behind you doesn't stop.

They're getting closer.

**OOC:**
- **Tashigi is on alert** for anything following the group.
- **Crocodile's spies** are likely aware you're in the city and may **begin to tighten their grip**.
- You're close to **Kohza's rally**, but your tail is growing.

---

Would you:

1. {Continue moving towards Kohza, but keep one eye on the tail. Prepare for an ambush.}  
2. {Stop and confront the **suspicious tail**. You can't have them following you any longer.}  
3. {Send a signal to the Straw Hats-call for backup or misdirection.}  
4. {Switch tactics and look for a **distraction** to buy time. Create chaos to confuse the tail.}

ð What do you do next?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - We're going to be surrounded by this rate. Straw hat boy, keep Blue safe. Get her to whoever the rebel leader fellow is. We'll get the tail off of us. I nod to Tashigi, Luffy, then Vivi

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - The Split That Matters]**  
**Scene: &quot;Cut the Tail Before It Bites&quot;**  
**Tone: Tactical Snap Decision | Mood: One Wrong Step From Chaos**

---

You stop.

Just for a moment.

But in a warzone, a moment is all it takes for **decisions to become history**.

You turn to **Luffy**, who's squatting slightly on his duck like he's ready to launch into orbit at any second.

&gt; &quot;Straw Hat boy.&quot;

He blinks. Grins slightly.

&gt; &quot;Yo.&quot;

You don't return the grin.

&gt; &quot;Get Blue to the rebel leader. Kohza. She's got the words to end this. We'll handle the tail.&quot;

You nod to **Tashigi**, then back to **Vivi**-your expression *dead serious.*

&gt; &quot;You're on the clock. End this war. We'll clean up behind you.&quot;

---

**Vivi's eyes widen.**  
&gt; &quot;But-&quot;

&gt; &quot;No buts.&quot; You point behind you with your baton. &quot;They're not here to negotiate. You are.&quot;

**Luffy stands tall.** No smirk now.

&gt; &quot;Got it.&quot;

He turns to Vivi, giving her a thumb-up.

&gt; &quot;Let's go, Princess!&quot;

---

**Tashigi's sword is already half-drawn**, her eyes narrowed at the shadows curling behind you.

You hear them now-**the quiet shuffle speeding up.**

&gt; &quot;Let's clean house,&quot; she murmurs.

---

**Usopp, Nami, and Sanji** split with Luffy and Vivi, pushing forward toward the plaza.

**Chopper** hesitates-looks between you and Vivi-but Vivi waves him forward.

&gt; &quot;Go with them. She'll need a medic.&quot;

He nods and runs ahead.

---

Now it's you and **Tashigi** in the alley, surrounded by the broken crates and cracked flags of the city.

And five shapes emerge behind you.

---

**Royal guards?**

No.

The **wrong crests** on the armor. The **wrong postures.**

The **same faces** you passed earlier-but now the hesitation's gone.

They advance.

**Weapons drawn.**

One licks his lips.

&gt; &quot;Never thought we'd get a bonus for killing a teacher.&quot;

Another smirks.

&gt; &quot;Marine too? That's just gravy.&quot;

---

**Tashigi draws her sword fully.**

Your baton's already in your hand.

&gt; &quot;Let's keep this clean,&quot; she says, flatly.

---

**OOC: You and Tashigi are now in combat against 5 disguised Baroque Works agents.**  
- Urban alley terrain. Narrow, with limited movement.  
- They believe you're isolated.  
- You're injured, weakened, but dangerous.  
- **Tashigi is at full strength.**

Would you like to:

1. {Take the lead in the fight. Use what juice you've got. You're the wall.}  
2. {Let Tashigi lead the clash. You support with tactics and distraction.}  
3. {Try to intimidate them into backing down. Play up your rep.}  
4. {Talk while fighting. Learn what Crocodile knows.}

ð How do you open the fight, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: ...I uh, mightve been full of false bravado back there. Not sure if I can actually take these guys.. (still weak from the previous injuries, and unconfident in my abilities)

Option 2 - Draw my baton and hold it up. But I'll watch your back til the end, Tashigi-chan

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - The Line Held by Two]**  
**Scene: &quot;Backs to the Wall&quot;**  
**Tone: Loyalty in the Face of Fear | Mood: Frail Courage, Sharpened Steel**

---

You **draw your baton**-still slick from dried juice and cracked from past fights. It hums in your hand like a tool used one too many times but never discarded.

And for a half-second... you consider running.

&gt; *You're still bleeding inside.  
You're low on juice.  
You're a schoolteacher, dammit.*

But your eyes don't leave the approaching figures.

And when your voice comes, it's quiet.

Cracked.

But steady.

&gt; &quot;...I uh, might've been full of false bravado back there.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Not sure if I can actually take these guys...&quot;

You raise the baton anyway.

&gt; &quot;But I'll watch your back to the end, Tashigi-chan.&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, standing tall beside you, doesn't even flinch.

She narrows her eyes as the five agents fan out across the alley's mouth.

Her voice doesn't rise.

But it cuts.

&gt; &quot;Then I'll take the front.&quot;

Her sword slides free, gleaming steel in the dim city light.

&gt; &quot;Just make sure they don't get *mine*.&quot;

---

**The first agent charges.**

You see the flash of a blade.

Tashigi **steps in fast**, sword clashing loud and clean-**metal screams off metal** as she pivots, then delivers a brutal pommel blow to the attacker's jaw, knocking him into a wall.

Two more try to flank-

You shift into position, baton raised like a teacher breaking up a playground brawl.

You're **not fast.**  
You're **not strong.**

But you're **present.**

And when one of them lunges toward her open side-  
You plant your feet.

And you **slam** your Seastone-tipped baton into the side of his arm with everything you have left.

&gt; *CRACK!*

He yelps. Drops his blade.

Tashigi doesn't miss the moment.

&gt; *SHING-* *THUD.*

One down.

---

&gt; &quot;Nice hit,&quot; she mutters, eyes still forward.

You're breathing hard already.

But alive.

---

**Three left.**

One's circling wide-trying to bait you out.  
Two are pressing in, one wielding twin daggers, the other a weighted chain.

They think they've got your measure now.

---

**OOC: You and Tashigi are holding your own-for now.  
You're low on stamina. Juice generation remains weak, but slowly improving.  
Enemies are lightly enhanced-trained Baroque agents, not high-ranking officers.**

Choose your role:

1. {Intercept the flanker. Use your last real burst of strength to stop the encircle.}  
2. {Stick tight to Tashigi. Play full defense. Let her shine.}  
3. {Try to outsmart the chain user. Use the alley terrain to restrict his movement.}  
4. {Attempt to generate just enough juice to make a slippery patch. Set up Tashigi for a sweep.}

ð What's your move, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 / 4 - my drip is weak. Stick to her back

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - The Back-to-Back Stand]**  
**Scene: &quot;Drip and Steel&quot;**  
**Tone: Underdog Determination | Mood: Smart Survival Over Flashy Heroics**

---

Your **legs burn**, your ribs protest every breath, and your juice reserves feel like you've got one kiwi seed rolling around in an empty bottle.

But you grit your teeth, plant your heels, and slide in **right behind Tashigi**.

&gt; &quot;Drip's weak,&quot; you mutter through clenched teeth. &quot;But I've still got enough to keep someone from getting the jump on you.&quot;

You raise your baton again-not to swing, but to **guard her blind side**. A **teacher's stance**: defensive, protective, and stubborn.

---

With a slow breath, you **will it**.

Not a torrent.

Not an elemental.

Just a **slick**, **thin sheen of juice**, flowing out from your boots in a widening puddle.

A soft gloss over stone.

Barely visible.

But **strategically placed**.

---

The chain-wielder steps into range first.

He spins it in rhythmic arcs, iron hissing through the air as he whips it toward you-aiming for your legs.

But he's stepping on the juice now.

Just a bit.

---

He plants his foot-and **slips.**

&gt; &quot;Wha-!?&quot;

His chain goes wide.

Tashigi doesn't miss a beat.

She **twists**, blade catching the air-and his exposed arm.

&gt; *SLASH-!*

He howls and stumbles back, clutching his elbow.

She doesn't even look at you.

&gt; &quot;Good.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;You're not fast,&quot; she mutters, parrying a dagger strike from the next one,  
&gt; &quot;but you're smart.&quot;

---

You're **exhausted.**  
Your knees are **shaking**.  
But she's still upright because **you're still upright.**

And that?

That's enough.

---

**Two enemies remain.**  
- One with daggers, circling Tashigi.  
- One flanker, hanging back-maybe waiting for an opening on *you.*

---

**OOC Status:**
- Your role is **tactical support**, limiting enemy movement.  
- Juice regeneration: **minimal but controlled.**  
- Combat cohesion with Tashigi: **Excellent.** She trusts you.

Would you:

1. {Draw the flanker's attention with baiting movement-force him out.}  
2. {Try to launch a small targeted juice glob at a dagger wielder's foot-buy Tashigi a second.}  
3. {Hold ground. Let her finish them. Preserve strength.}  
4. {Whisper something to her mid-fight-encourage, guide, or distract.}

ð Next move, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Wait for Tashigi to finish her opponent first (if she can). Try to buy time with the flanker

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - The Waiting Game]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Best Kind of Cowardice is Tactical&quot;**  
**Tone: Breathless Control | Mood: The Longest Seconds of Your Life**

---

You don't move.

Not because you can't-though your knees **definitely aren't thrilled** with the idea.

But because now, it's not about being brave.

It's about being **smart.**

&gt; &quot;Come on, Tashigi-chan,&quot; you murmur under your breath.  
&gt; &quot;Take him out fast... I'll keep his friend busy.&quot;

---

You shift your stance slightly-**baiting**.

Not obvious. Just enough for the flanker to **see a weakness**.

Your weight's on your left leg now. You keep your arm low. You let your baton wobble slightly like your grip's failing.

And sure enough-

The flanker starts to move.

---

You keep one eye on **Tashigi**.

She's dancing with the dagger wielder now-tight quarters, blade against blade, her feet gliding through the slick patch you laid down like she owns it.

She ducks.

&gt; *CLANG-!*

She twists.

&gt; *SHING-*

A scream.

The dagger wielder drops. Arm gashed. Out cold.

---

She whips around to your side just as the **flanker lunges** toward you.

---

&gt; &quot;Left side!&quot; you bark.

She's already moving.

&gt; *CLANG-!*  
&gt; *SLASH-!*  
&gt; *THUD.*

---

Silence.

The alley is still.

**Five Baroque agents down.**  
**You're still breathing.**  
Barely.

---

Tashigi breathes hard beside you, sweat gleaming on her brow.

She doesn't say anything for a moment.

Then:

&gt; &quot;...You held up.&quot;

Her tone is measured. Not overly impressed. Not dismissive.

But *respectful*.

---

You lean against the wall, catching your breath, blinking grit out of your eyes.

&gt; &quot;Told you I'd watch your back.&quot;

You glance at the fallen enemies.

&gt; &quot;Could really go for a substitute teacher about now, though.&quot;

---

**OOC: Victory Achieved.**  
- You and Tashigi have successfully defeated the tailing squad.  
- Vivi and Luffy are now en route to Kohza **uninterrupted**.  
- You are *exhausted*, but have recovered just enough juice to **defend yourself once** in an emergency.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Regroup immediately with Vivi and the Straw Hats. You've bought enough time.}  
2. {Interrogate one of the Baroque agents before they bleed out.}  
3. {Rest for a few moments. Catch your breath. You're on the edge.}  
4. {Check on Tashigi-how is she holding up after everything?}

ð What's next, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - You still doing alright, Tashigi-chan? I breathe heavily

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - Blood, Dust, and Breath]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Weight Carried in Silence&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Concern | Mood: The Calm After a Close Cut**

---

You lean against the scorched alley wall, every rib reminding you they're still cracked, every breath a tug-of-war between oxygen and pain.

Your baton hand trembles.  
Your juice is more **dry pulp** than flow now.  
But you're still on your feet.

---

You glance over at **Tashigi**, who stands silently over the last downed agent, sword still held downward, tip almost touching the stone.

Blood on her glove.  
Scuffs on her glasses.  
Jaw set like a cracked statue.

She's alive.  
But she's *quiet.*

---

&gt; &quot;You still doing alright, Tashigi-chan?&quot; you ask between shallow breaths, voice low.

---

She doesn't look at you at first.

Just **wipes her blade** on a fallen cloak and sheaths it with practiced ease.

Then, finally-

&gt; &quot;...I'm fine.&quot;

But the word doesn't *feel* fine.  
It lands flat. Heavy. Tired.

She straightens, exhales through her nose, and finally meets your gaze.

&gt; &quot;They were kids too.&quot;

Her voice is colder now. Not bitter. Not angry.

Just... hollow.

&gt; &quot;Not much older than the ones we're protecting.&quot;

---

You see it now-the way her hand lingers at her side.  
The subtle twitch in her fingers.

Not from injury.

From **restraint**.

From what it cost her to *do what she had to.*

---

She glances away.

&gt; &quot;We're in a country where the princess went undercover as a terrorist, the guards are double agents, and we've got pirates trying to save lives.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You tell me if *anyone's* doing alright.&quot;

---

The silence between you is heavier than the dust.

But it's **honest.**

---

**OOC: Tashigi is physically unharmed, but emotionally weighed down.  
She respects you deeply now-possibly more than anyone in her chain of command.  
She's shaken, but holding.**

Would you like to respond-lighten the moment, bond deeper, or move on toward the plaza?

&gt;&gt; USER: Yeah, you and me both. Let's... Get to the plaza. Make sure the princess hasn't been eaten by a Crocodile yet.

I start, but my legs give out.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - Legs of Sand]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Cost of Standing Tall&quot;**  
**Tone: Bittersweet Collapse | Mood: Loyalty Beyond Limits**

---

&gt; &quot;Yeah, you and me both.&quot;

Your voice is low.  
Worn.

You push off the wall-your baton clinking as it drops slightly in your grip.

&gt; &quot;Let's... get to the plaza.&quot;

You take two steps forward.

&gt; &quot;Make sure the princess hasn't been eaten by a-&quot;

&gt; *thud.*

Your knees betray you.

The world tilts slightly.

Your baton clatters to the ground with a dry metallic rattle.

---

**Tashigi spins around** immediately, stepping forward to catch you before you fully collapse, her hands firm on your shoulders.

&gt; &quot;Hey-! Cheng-&quot;

You blink. Your breath catches.

Not from fear.

Not from blood.

Just... **empty.**

You spent everything you had.

---

Tashigi lowers you gently to a seated position beside the alley wall.

She crouches beside you, jaw tight, checking your pulse instinctively.

&gt; &quot;You're alive.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Just... running on fumes.&quot;

---

You blink up at the sky above the alley-thin wisps of cloud drifting above the cracked towers.

And you think, somewhere in the dizziness-

&gt; *At least it's a nice day to pass out.*

---

**Tashigi rises.**

You see her silhouetted now against the alley's end, sword drawn again.

&gt; &quot;Rest.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'll get you to the plaza.&quot;

---

And for the first time...

She sounds **like you did.**

Back when you were protecting her.

---

**OOC: You've collapsed from exhaustion.  
This is not unconsciousness-but your body can't continue for now.  
Your juice is depleted. Your stamina is drained.  
Tashigi will get you to the plaza after checking the route.**

Would you like to say one last thing before she steps out to clear the path ahead?

&gt;&gt; USER: Nod tiredly.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Back Alley - A Nod Between Soldiers]**  
**Scene: &quot;One Word Less, All the Meaning More&quot;**  
**Tone: Silent Understanding | Mood: A Quiet Pact**

---

You don't speak.

There's nothing clever left to say.  
No quip. No retort.  
No lecture on the responsibilities of adults or the failures of nations.

Just-

&gt; *A nod.*

Heavy. Slow.  
Full of everything you couldn't put into words if you tried.

---

**Tashigi watches you.**

For a moment, her features soften-just slightly.  
Like the soldier's mask she wears cracks enough for the woman beneath to see you not as a colleague, or a fool...

But as a man who stood up until he couldn't.

---

She exhales, the sound like steel cooling.

&gt; &quot;Stay alive, Sensei.&quot;

Then she turns, sword drawn once more, stepping toward the alley's edge-  
where the plaza begins to burn louder.

---

And you lean back, head against the stone, letting the war echo just beyond your reach.

You're still in this fight.

Even if it's just to keep breathing until the kids win.

---

**OOC:**  
You are now in a **temporary disabled state**.  
- Unable to walk unaided.  
- Juice at critical low.  
- Still conscious.  
- **Tashigi** is clearing the path ahead for your return to the narrative climax.

You've held the line.

Now it's their turn.

Would you like to fade to black briefly, or continue observing from the ground, waiting to re-enter when the timing's right?

&gt;&gt; USER: I shift into an alleyway, hopefully out of sight of passerbys.

OOC: Meanwhile... At the plaza

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Plaza of Sand and Smoke]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Rally Point&quot;**  
**Tone: Tense | Mood: Truth Teetering on a Razor's Edge**

---

**Location: Clocktower Plaza, First District**  
The sun is a molten coin in the sky, framed by rising pillars of smoke. The **plaza**-once a grand communal square for festivals and royal proclamations-is now a cracked battlefield-in-waiting.

**Thousands** of **rebel soldiers** crowd the stone thoroughfare, banners raised, weapons drawn, sand crusting their boots. Their faces are twisted with **anger**, **confusion**, and **loss**.

And at the center-  
Standing on a makeshift dais made of a shattered cart and broken stone-

**Kohza.**

The rebel leader.  
Vivi's childhood friend.  
His voice is raised, rallying the army to charge the **royal palace**, convinced King Cobra has betrayed the people.

---

&gt; &quot;We've waited long enough! They stole the rains! They stole our food! Now they'll pay in blood-!&quot;

His words whip the crowd into a frenzy.

The pressure is rising.

If no one stops it-  
This war will ignite *for real*.

---

But just before the final shout-  
**a figure bursts onto the plaza from the side streets.**

---

**Vivi.**

Covered in dust. Eyes blazing.

**Luffy, Nami, Usopp, Sanji, Chopper** at her back.

She raises her hands.

Her voice *cuts* through the chaos like a blade:

&gt; &quot;*STOP!!*&quot;

---

The crowd goes still.

Weapons lower-but not entirely.

Kohza turns, disbelief and tension carved into every line of his face.

&gt; &quot;...Vivi?&quot;

---

She walks forward, slowly.

&gt; &quot;It wasn't the king. It wasn't the royal family.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The drought... the uprising... everything. *All of it.*&quot;

Her voice trembles, but doesn't break.

&gt; &quot;It was Baroque Works. It was **Crocodile**.&quot;

---

Murmurs erupt.

Confused. Angry. Skeptical.

&gt; &quot;Liar.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Is that really her?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Crocodile's a hero.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;What proof does she have?&quot;

---

Vivi stands tall.

Her fists tighten at her sides.

&gt; &quot;You want proof? Look at your men. Look at the âroyal guards' that ambushed you. Look at the agents hiding in *your own army!*&quot;

&gt; &quot;How many of them refused to recognize me?!&quot;

---

Kohza's expression begins to change.

He looks toward the surrounding soldiers-many of whom **aren't reacting** the way they should.

---

And that's when it happens.

**Gunfire.**

From the **rooftops.**

A sudden scream. A *planted* explosion.

A shot fired from within the rebel ranks-

And someone cries:

&gt; &quot;THE ROYAL GUARD HAS FIRED FIRST!&quot;

The trap is sprung.

---

**Panic.**

The rebels begin to charge.  
The plaza explodes into **chaos**.

And through it all, Vivi stands still-frozen, **betrayed again**, her voice drowned beneath the fury of manipulated war.

---

**Luffy turns to her.**  
His expression hardens.

&gt; &quot;We're not done yet.&quot;

---

**OOC: The plaza is now in full combat.  
Baroque agents have triggered a false-flag operation to reignite the war.  
Vivi's words *almost* worked-but Crocodile's hand was faster.**

Would you like to cut back to Eatone attempting to re-enter the scene-or continue following the Straw Hats' intervention at the heart of the uprising?

&gt;&gt; USER: Continue with the intervention. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Fire Beneath the Sand]**  
**Scene: &quot;Intervention at the Breaking Point&quot;**  
**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Courage vs. Chaos**

---

**The false gunshot echoes like a match dropped on dry grass.**

In seconds, the carefully balanced moment **collapses**.  
The rebel line surges. The royal forces-drawn from the palace's interior-rally in a panic.  
The **plaza erupts** into a brawl of steel, smoke, and screams.

**But the Straw Hats don't hesitate.**

---

&gt; **Luffy**, face set with uncharacteristic focus, leaps up the side of a plaza building in seconds. His body arcs through the air like a coiled spring unleashed.

&gt; &quot;I'll stop the gunfire!&quot;

You see it-**snipers** on the roofs. Hidden Baroque Works agents using both sides as puppets.

Luffy **stretches**, his arms launching outward-

&gt; *&quot;Gomu Gomu no Gatling!&quot;*

-*and flattens three rooftop agents* in a blur of fists and motion.

---

&gt; **Sanji** dives into the chaos, spinning through royal guards and rebels alike-not to injure, but to **disarm**, knock back, and *redirect*.

&gt; &quot;Out of the way, you amateurs! You're all being played!&quot;

---

&gt; **Usopp** raises his slingshot high, firing a **Firebird Star** into the air-a bright streak of light arcing above the battlefield.

&gt; &quot;HEY! LISTEN UP! This war's fake! You're being played like chumps by Crocodile!&quot;

Some hear him. Some don't.

---

&gt; **Nami** grabs **Chopper's** hoof and yells into the winds rising off the desert.

&gt; &quot;You've got one job: keep Vivi safe! I'll start calling down lightning if this gets any worse.&quot;

She raises her **Clima-Tact**, winds whipping around her as she begins to form **storm clouds** in the heat-choked air.

---

**Vivi... stands still.**

Her eyes wide, watching everything **she tried to prevent unfold again**.

Until **Chopper** tugs her arm.

&gt; &quot;Vivi! We still have a chance!&quot;

---

She snaps back into motion.

&gt; &quot;Kohza!&quot;

She darts toward the platform, trying to reach him again-but the tide of soldiers is **pushing them apart**.

---

**Kohza**, still trying to restore order, is losing his grip on the moment.

&gt; &quot;STOP FIGHTING! I SAID-*STOP!!*&quot;

But it's a maelstrom.

---

**Then, overhead-**

&gt; *A familiar laugh.*  
&gt; *Dry. Smug. Echoing.*

&gt; **&quot;I was wondering when you'd all show up.&quot;**

**Crocodile's voice.**

---

Every head turns toward the **palace roofline** where **he now stands**, cloak billowing, beside a restrained, slumped figure-

**King Cobra.**

---

&gt; &quot;Nice of you to make it just in time to witness the fall of a kingdom.&quot;

His voice carries.

&gt; &quot;Don't worry. I'm not here to kill you.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'm here to show you that no matter how much you fight...&quot;

He gestures broadly to the plaza below.

&gt; &quot;You're *already too late.*&quot;

---

**OOC: Crocodile is now visible.  
King Cobra is his hostage.  
He is openly taunting the crowd, destabilizing all efforts to end the conflict peacefully.**

Vivi, Luffy, and the crew are trying to keep things from spiraling completely out of control.

Would you like to:  
1. {Continue following the Straw Hats' fight to stabilize the plaza.}  
2. {Shift perspective to Crocodile's taunt and Cobra's condition.}  
3. {Begin transitioning back to Eatone and Tashigi's POV.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 and 3 (Tashigi. Eatone is enjoying the cool cobblestone floor)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Split Perspective - Above and Below the Kingdom]**  
**Scene A: &quot;The Crocodile's Gambit&quot;**  
**Scene B: &quot;Steel Steps Forward&quot;**  
**Tone: Rising Stakes | Mood: Pride vs. Power**

---

### **Scene A - Palace Roofline**

**Crocodile stands high above the chaos.**  
Cloak flowing. Sand whispering at his heels like a loyal hound.

Next to him:  
**King Cobra.**  
Bound. Bruised. Head bowed-but still breathing.

Crocodile's voice carries over the entire city square like a king addressing his new court.

---

&gt; &quot;You all wanted the truth?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Here it is.&quot;

He places a gloved hand on Cobra's shoulder, not hard-just **possessive**.

&gt; &quot;Your king has been hiding secrets beneath this very palace. Forbidden knowledge-sacrificing you all while clutching power the World Government has deemed... dangerous.&quot;

---

He grins wide.

&gt; &quot;And while you squabble and bleed, I'll be taking that power.&quot;

He turns slightly, not even looking at Cobra as he continues:

&gt; &quot;Alabasta was never the goal. It was just the doorway.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And your loyalty, your rebellions, your tears?&quot;

He shrugs.

&gt; &quot;Collateral.&quot;

---

From the plaza below, **Vivi shouts up**:

&gt; &quot;You're lying!&quot;

Crocodile glances down-casually, as if noticing a fly.

&gt; &quot;Am I?&quot;

---

His **sand swirls**, rising like a serpent around him. You can feel the heat tighten in your lungs.

---

### **Scene B - A Sword in the Dust**

Back in the side alley-half a district behind the plaza-**Tashigi lowers her hand from her transponder snail.**

She tried to call reinforcements again.

**No signal.**

The sky over the rooftops glows with the flashes of lightning and fire. The crowd's roar fills every gap in the buildings.

She breathes in.  
Then out.

Then turns back to you-slumped just inside the alley, half-conscious.

---

&gt; &quot;Crocodile's shown himself.&quot;

She says it calmly, but there's **something in her eyes**. Rage.  
And not just for the kingdom.

But for **you**-lying broken behind her.  
For **Vivi**, bleeding herself on hope.

For **everyone who's still just trying to do the right thing** while a monster tries to rewrite history.

---

She steps forward.

&gt; &quot;If he's going to bury this country...&quot;

&gt; &quot;He'll have to get through my sword first.&quot;

---

She vanishes down the alley. Toward the fight.

---

And you?

You just barely shift on the cool cobblestone floor.

Still breathing.

Still listening.

Still alive.

---

**OOC Status:**  
- Crocodile has revealed himself. His goal is now openly connected to the **Poneglyph beneath the palace**.  
- King Cobra is alive, but **bound and powerless**.  
- Vivi's effort to end the war peacefully has been undone by Crocodile's manipulation-**but hope still flickers**.  
- Tashigi is en route to the plaza alone.  
- Eatone is recovering. You may re-enter soon-depending on how much longer you push yourself.

---

Would you like to:  
1. {Follow Tashigi as she enters the battlefield and confronts Crocodile's fallout.}  
2. {Jump to Luffy and Vivi reacting to Crocodile's reveal.}  
3. {Fade back to Eatone, waking up with a choice to make.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 

Meanwhile. I notice Tashigi, ever headstrong, rush off to stop Crocodile, somehow.

I wonder if she forgot that she said she'd give me a hand to the plaza. Oh well 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Wind Before the Storm]**  
**Scene: &quot;Hope, Interrupted&quot;**  
**Tone: Pressure Mounting | Mood: Fearless vs. Futile**

---

The **plaza churns**-steel against steel, civilians scrambling to safety, rebel soldiers turning their blades toward a king they no longer trust, and royal guards doing the same in kind.

But **the Straw Hats fight like anchors**-holding together the last frayed strands of truth in the storm.

And at the center-

**Vivi.**

Dust caked into her dress. Arms outstretched between rebels and guards, screaming herself hoarse above the roar of battle.

---

&gt; &quot;STOP IT! CROCODILE IS LYING TO ALL OF YOU!&quot;

Her voice strains, breaks, and keeps going.

&gt; &quot;THIS ISN'T WHAT KOZHA WANTED! THIS ISN'T WHO WE ARE!&quot;

---

But the crowd?

The crowd doesn't know who to believe anymore.

---

And overhead, **Crocodile's grin only widens**.

His cloak whips dramatically in the wind as he drags **King Cobra** closer to the roof's edge, displaying him like a marionette.

&gt; &quot;Touching, Princess. But I don't think they're listening anymore.&quot;

He lifts a hand-and **sand begins to swirl at his feet**.

&gt; &quot;So let's give them something they *can't ignore.*&quot;

---

Suddenly-

&gt; **&quot;*CROCODILE!!*&quot;**

A voice rings out across the plaza, full of steel and fury.

**Tashigi.**

---

She's standing on the opposite building, sword drawn, wind kicking at her coat.

&gt; &quot;You're under arrest, by order of the Marines-&quot;

&gt; &quot;-and on behalf of *everyone you've hurt in this country.*&quot;

---

Crocodile turns slowly to look at her, amused.

&gt; &quot;Oh. It's you. The little one with the glasses.&quot;

He lifts a finger.

&gt; &quot;Still swinging that toy around like it means something?&quot;

---

**Tashigi doesn't flinch.**

Not when the sand hisses around her feet.

Not when the crowd below watches in stunned silence.

Not even when **Crocodile lifts his hand** and the first **spike of sand** forms beneath her.

---

&gt; &quot;This isn't for me,&quot; she says quietly.

Then louder-

&gt; &quot;*It's for them.*&quot;

She leaps.

Sword gleaming.

---

**Scene Cut - Meanwhile...**

Back in the alley, **you groan softly**, shifting against the wall.

You heard the shout.

The name.

You smirk just slightly through the ache.

&gt; &quot;I guess she *did* forget about giving me a hand to the plaza...&quot;

You close your eyes again for a second.

&gt; &quot;Oh well.&quot;

---

**OOC: Crocodile vs. Tashigi is beginning.  
Vivi is still in the plaza, on the edge of despair.  
Straw Hats are holding the crowd together.  
Eatone is recovering-**slowly**.  
But the stage is set.  
The next blow Crocodile lands might shatter the kingdom.**

Would you like to continue the **Tashigi vs. Crocodile** battle, shift to **Vivi's emotional breaking point**, or return to **Eatone preparing to rise again**?

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: Crocodile outclasses all current allied combatants by a light-year. Because of that, he is likely to toy with them, rather than kill them outright

**Scene: &quot;How Many Times Must I Fail?&quot;**  
**Tone: Desperate | Mood: Fracture Beneath the Crown**

---

The noise is deafening.

Steel. Shouts. Gunfire. Explosions.

And **Vivi** is still screaming-

But it feels like she's underwater now.

Her words **don't carry** like they used to. Her voice cracks every few seconds.

Every time she thinks she's reached them-**the crowd shifts again.**

Someone throws a rock. Someone fires a shot. Another rebel charges blindly into a royal line, blaming them for everything.

The **truth** is buried under the **noise**.

---

And then she hears it:

&gt; &quot;CROCODILE!!&quot;

**Tashigi's voice**, cutting across the plaza from above.

She looks up, eyes widening as she sees the duel unfolding on the rooftop.

---

Crocodile doesn't attack like a killer.

He attacks like a **cat playing with a mouse**.

He's not in a rush.

He knows he's already won.

---

**Tashigi swings.**  
A sand spike slams into her side, sending her skidding across the rooftop, coughing blood.

---

And Vivi?

She stumbles.

Almost falls.

---

&gt; &quot;No...&quot;

She watches **King Cobra**, her father, strung up like a symbol.  
**Tashigi**, struck down in a single breath.  
The **rebels and guards**, driven to chaos by a lie she couldn't stop.

---

&gt; &quot;No, no, no...&quot;

Her legs keep moving, even as her arms fall limply to her sides.  
She walks, zombie-like, through the crowd that no longer sees her.

---

&gt; *Why won't they listen?*

&gt; *Why wasn't the truth enough?*

&gt; *How many more have to get hurt-because I failed?*

---

A stone strikes the ground near her foot.

Another guard pushes past her, yelling something about reinforcements.

&gt; &quot;She's just a girl-get her out of the way!&quot;

---

&gt; *Just a girl.*

Her fingers tremble.

&gt; *That's all I ever was, isn't it? Just a girl playing at peace?*

---

She falls to her knees near the shattered dais where **Kohza once stood**.

Around her, the plaza is fire and sand.

And the last of her hope-

**Cracks.**

---

&gt; &quot;...I tried.&quot;

The words barely escape her lips.

&gt; &quot;I tried...&quot;

---

And above her-**Crocodile's sand begins to swirl wider.**

He's raising his hand again.

Not to kill.

But to **demonstrate**.

A **storm is coming.**

---

**OOC:**  
Vivi is nearing a **complete emotional collapse**.  
Her words failed. Her strength is gone.  
The symbol of Alabasta is **on her knees** as Crocodile begins to unleash a larger-scale sandstorm.

The **Straw Hats are watching**, unsure whether to break formation or save her.

Would you like to:

1. {Continue with Vivi's breakdown and what might pull her out.}  
2. {Jump to Luffy witnessing Vivi's despair and deciding to act.}  
3. {Cut to Eatone, feeling the shift in pressure, making a decision.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 and 2 - Meanwhile, back in an alley, somewhere, I continue laying around like a dried up earthworm

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - When Words No Longer Work]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Princess and the Pirate&quot;**  
**Tone: Cracked Hope | Mood: The Flame Flickering Out**

---

**Vivi is still kneeling.**

Fists clenched in the dust.  
Sand swirls in the air, thickening the air in her lungs.  
Even the colors feel muted. Like the city is dying in slow motion around her.

&gt; &quot;I tried...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;I really tried...&quot;

She doesn't cry.

She **doesn't have the energy** left to cry.

She just kneels and listens to the **roar of war**, knowing her voice was **never loud enough**.

Knowing she couldn't stop it.

Knowing she failed.

---

And then-

**A shadow steps in front of her.**

---

**Straw Hat Luffy.**

Dust on his hat. Blood on his knuckles.

He doesn't say anything at first.

He just **looks at her**-the girl who's carried a nation on her back, and finally stumbled.

---

She doesn't meet his gaze.  
Not until he speaks.

---

&gt; &quot;You did everything you could.&quot;

His voice is calm.

&gt; &quot;You did more than anyone else ever would.&quot;

She looks up, barely able to lift her head.

&gt; &quot;...But I didn't stop it.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I couldn't stop *him*...&quot;

---

Luffy crouches down.

Not beside her.

**In front of her.**

So she has to look him in the eye.

---

&gt; &quot;You're not supposed to.&quot;

He pulls his hat low, letting the shadow fall over his eyes.

&gt; &quot;*I'm gonna stop him.*&quot;

---

She blinks.

&gt; &quot;What...?&quot;

---

He stands again, facing the rooftop.

Facing **Crocodile.**

&gt; &quot;You asked us for help.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Now let us do it.&quot;

---

He cracks his neck once.

Sand rises. The sky dims.

Crocodile is **raising a second storm**, large enough to **devour the plaza**.

---

&gt; &quot;You rest now.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We fight.&quot;

---

And then he's gone-**leaping upward**, fists clenched, hurtling toward the storm.

---

**OOC: Luffy is en route to Crocodile.  
Vivi is still on the ground, stunned-but a spark flickers. A weight is lifted.  
She finally let someone else carry the burden.**

---

**Meanwhile...**

Back in an alleyway, **a tired, dusty schoolteacher** blinks slowly from the floor, ribs aching.

Somewhere in the distance, **thunder rumbles**.

You grunt softly.

&gt; &quot;...Sounds like someone woke the brat up.&quot;

You don't move.

Not yet.

But the **air pressure is changing.**

---

Would you like to transition to Luffy's confrontation with Crocodile?  
Or let Eatone start crawling his way back to relevance?

&gt;&gt; USER: Groan. I gotta get moving. Can't let some children show me up. Not after everything I said.

I flex my muscles experimentally - no dice. Instead, I conjure a thin film of kiwi juice in front of me, and will it to turn into a stream. Like a greased pig, I start slithering my way down the cobblestone towards the plaza.

OOC: Where is Tashigi?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Alleyways - Slither of Determination]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Kiwi-Crawl of Shame&quot;**

You groan.

The kind of groan that says: *I'm not done, I'm just disgusted by how little gas is left in the tank.*

&gt; &quot;Can't let some children show me up. Not after everything I said...&quot;

You brace your hands.

Muscles protest. Bones ache.

But you're awake.

You're angry.

You're **alive.**

---

So, you conjure a film of **sticky, citrus-slick kiwi juice** along the cobblestones.

It glistens faintly, trailing out ahead like a path forged by sheer, exhausted spite.

&gt; &quot;Okay. No walking. That's fine.&quot;

You take a breath.

And-

**SLURP.**

You begin **slithering** forward like a **greased-up, determined sea cucumber**, sliding through the dust like a tropical slug of justice.

---

It's not elegant.

It's not fast.

But damn it-it's **movement**.

---

**Meanwhile...**

### **Where Is Tashigi?**

**Status: Engaged in rooftop combat with Crocodile.**

---

Last seen, **Tashigi confronted Crocodile directly** on the palace rooftop while Vivi was collapsing below. She struck first-bold, clean, furious.

But she was **outmatched**.

Crocodile, amused and unhurried, struck her with a blast of sand, knocking her off her feet and sending her sliding across the roof's edge.

---

Right now:

- She's alive.
- She's wounded.
- But she's still standing.

She's buying time-her **sword clashes against his sand**, steel against storm-but every blow tells the same story.

&gt; He's not fighting to kill her.  
&gt; He's fighting to **prove how small she is**.

---

But she's holding.

For now.

Because someone else is coming.

---

**Luffy.**

---

He's rocketing toward the rooftop from the plaza floor, rubber limbs stretching as he **leaps from a building**, headed straight for the rising cyclone that Crocodile is now forming with a **casual flick of his fingers**.

---

The real fight is about to begin.

---

**OOC: Eatone is moving toward the battlefield at 0.0001 knots.  
Tashigi is wounded but active.  
Luffy is seconds from clashing with Crocodile.  
Vivi is recovering from emotional collapse-watching from below.**

Would you like to follow:
1. {Luffy vs. Crocodile, Round 1}  
2. {Tashigi's desperate retreat-or final stand}  
3. {Eatone, slithering with commentary}  
4. {Vivi's reaction to the storm that's about to start}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 and 2.

I slowly start building momentum, my speed turning from beached seal to snake on crack

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Rooftop of Storms and Steel]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Crocodile and the Rising Tide&quot;**  
**Tone: Climactic | Mood: Outclassed but Not Outfought**

---

### **Part I: The Duel of the Doomed**

**Tashigi's boots scrape across cracked tile.**  
She's breathing hard, one eye nearly swollen shut, her blade trembling in her grip. Her coat is half-burned, sand caked into the fabric.

**Crocodile** looms at the far edge of the rooftop.  
King Cobra is slumped just behind him, barely conscious.  
And the air itself is **twisting** with heat and pressure, sand circling the Warlord like a divine curse.

---

&gt; &quot;Still standing?&quot; Crocodile says, voice dripping arrogance. &quot;Hmph. Admirable. But pointless.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're not the one I want.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're just here to fill the silence.&quot;

---

**Tashigi lunges.**

Her sword gleams in the orange glow of the desert light.  
A clean, practiced thrust-aimed for his throat.

---

But Crocodile doesn't move.

Instead-**his chest dissolves into sand**, the blade sliding through him like a stick through smoke.

&gt; &quot;Ah ah,&quot; he chuckles.  
&gt; &quot;You should've studied harder.&quot;

---

**Slam.**

His arm turns into a **twisting hook of solid sand**, and **he backhands her** across the rooftop.

She *flies* into the palace's stone ledge, gasping for air, her sword spinning from her grip.

---

She coughs, curls one arm over her ribs.  
Her teeth are gritted.

But she's still alive.

Still trying to rise.

---

And then-

---

### **Part II: Enter the Rubber Reckoning**

&gt; &quot;*GOMU GOMU NO... BAZOOKA!!*&quot;

---

A blur of red and gold **slams into Crocodile's torso** with the force of a cannonball.

**Luffy**, wild-eyed, cloak flapping, hits him like a comet-both fists **buried into the Warlord's chest**.

---

The explosion of sand is **immediate and violent.**  
Crocodile is launched backward, skidding across the rooftop tiles in a **spray of grit and gravel**.

Tashigi covers her face from the blast, stunned.

---

**Crocodile lands, rolls, and slides-**

Then **slowly rises.**

---

Not a scratch.

Not even a tear in his coat.

---

&gt; &quot;Hmph.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Rubber.&quot;

He dusts his shoulder.

&gt; &quot;You're one of *Whitebeard's pet insects,* aren't you?&quot;

---

**Luffy lands, face shadowed beneath his hat.**

He says nothing.

---

Tashigi, still kneeling, watches from the ledge.  
Her eyes are wide, her voice hoarse.

&gt; &quot;He's not just fighting him...&quot;

&gt; &quot;He's challenging a Warlord.&quot;

---

The wind howls.  
The sandstorm swirls.  
And two titans stand across from each other on the edge of the world.

---

**OOC:**  
- **Tashigi** is wounded, out of the fight-for now.  
- **Luffy** has initiated combat with **Crocodile**, Round One.  
- **Crocodile is amused, but no longer toying.**  
- The real battle for Alabasta has begun.

---

**Meanwhile...**

Down an alley several blocks away, a **green-tinted blur** of moisture is now **zipping** down the cobblestone like an overcaffeinated garden hose.

You've hit **moderate cruising speed.**

A passing stray cat watches you slither by with a look of sheer confusion.

---

Would you like to follow:  
1. {The battle between Luffy and Crocodile}  
2. {Tashigi trying to regroup or rejoin}  
3. {Eatone closing in-fast(er), perhaps even upright soon}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Tashigi is heavily injured, unlikely to be combat effective for a long time.

Meanwhile, the rest of the straw hats are in a protective ring around Vivi, as she pleads for the fighting to stop. Tashigi, form her vantage point, notices some oddly moving guards approaching from a blind spot. But she's too winded to do or say anything about it

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Rooftop Cracked and Bleeding]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Limits of Steel&quot;**  
**Tone: Frustration and Helplessness | Mood: Watching the Inevitable**

---

**Tashigi lies slumped** against the cracked edge of the palace rooftop.

Her ribs scream. Her vision blurs.

She can *still hear* the clash of fists behind her-**Luffy hammering into Crocodile**, wild and furious-but she doesn't dare turn to look again. Every shift in her ribs feels like gravel grinding in her chest.

&gt; *I can't... move.*

She grips the tile, trying to rise-

&gt; *I can't... even draw my sword.*

---

But her eyes still work.

And they drift-**down.**

To the plaza.

---

**Vivi is back on her feet**, surrounded now by **Zoro, Sanji, Usopp, Nami, and Chopper**, who've formed a **ring around her**-protecting her with the sheer presence of belief.

She's calling out again.

&gt; &quot;Kohza! Everyone, please! This war isn't real!&quot;

&gt; &quot;Crocodile's manipulating us all!&quot;

The crowd is **wavering**, like a tide ready to shift.

---

And that's when **Tashigi sees it.**

---

From her rooftop perch, through her bleary eye-

**Four figures.**

In royal armor.

Moving too precisely.

Too slowly.

**Wrong.**

---

They approach from the **eastern quadrant** of the plaza-where **Vivi's blind side** is vulnerable.  
Their weapons are lowered, faces obscured under sand-dulled helmets.

&gt; *Baroque Works.*

&gt; *Assassins.* Sleeper agents embedded deep.

She tries to raise her voice.

Nothing.

Tries to stand.

Her legs *won't answer.*

---

She claws forward, dragging herself to the edge of the rooftop.

&gt; *Please... someone... anyone-*

She watches them close in behind Vivi and the Straw Hats.

They're **seconds away**.

And **she can't stop them.**

---

**OOC: Tashigi is critically wounded and temporarily out of action.  
She has spotted a new threat: Baroque Works agents in disguise approaching Vivi's rear flank.  
Straw Hats are distracted defending from the front.**

Would you like to:

1. {Shift to Vivi and the Straw Hats - do they notice in time?}  
2. {Return to Eatone - this may be your moment.}  
3. {Explore Kohza's view-he may notice the false guards from within the crowd.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 / 3 - Kohza is close, but not that close to intercept.

Meanwhile, I'm approaching the plaza at a moderate pace now, worming my way around downed fighters and collapsed buildings. Some might charitably call it a jogging pace. Tashigi may notice a trail of green snaking out of one of the side streets

**Scene B: &quot;The Juice Before Justice&quot;**  
**Tone: Threads Tightening | Mood: Imminent Collision**

---

### **Scene A - Kohza, the Watchful Flame**

Amid the crowd of rebels, shouting and shoving for control, **Kohza** still stands near the fractured fountain where his rally had turned into a riot.

He's banged up. Covered in dust. **Conflicted to his core.**

---

He saw Vivi.

He *heard* her.

And despite everything-  
Despite the gunfire and the lies and the roar of the mob-  
**he believed her.**

---

But he didn't act fast enough.

---

His eyes flick to the palace again, just in time to see **Luffy crash into Crocodile**, just in time to see sand explode into the sky-

And then-

He catches movement at the plaza's edge.

Four guards, closing in from a blind angle.

&gt; *Too clean. Too perfect.*

His brow furrows.

&gt; &quot;Baroque...&quot;

He starts moving, **pushing through the crowd**-but he's too far.

Too slow.

They'll reach her **before he can.**

---

---

### **Scene B - Here Comes the Juice**

You round the corner of a fractured alley-

The sounds of battle **slam into your ears** like a wall of steel and shouting.

But you're not focused on that.

You're focused on the **green, gleaming stream** of juice **you've been sliding on** like a waterpark ride from hell.

---

You are-

- Covered in grit.  
- Slightly damp.  
- And moving at the speed of a mildly determined slug who's had one too many energy drinks.

But you're **getting there.**

---

The buildings fall away, and suddenly:

You see it.

The **plaza**.

The **chaos**.

And-just ahead-

**Four &quot;guards&quot; moving toward a young woman in blue.**

You don't know who the hell Kohza is.

But you know **those guards are wrong.**

And that girl?

&gt; *That's Blue.*

---

Behind you, the green streak glistens on the ground-a ridiculous but glorious **trail of teacher justice.**

---

From **Tashigi's rooftop**, through a haze of blood and dust-

She sees it.

A **shimmer of green**.

Snaking through the rubble.

&gt; &quot;...You crazy son of a-&quot;

---

**OOC: You are now within striking distance of the Baroque agents sneaking up on Vivi.  
You may only have time for **one** decisive move before they strike.**

Would you like to:

1. {Launch a high-speed glob of juice at their legs-trip or blind them.}  
2. {Throw yourself between them and Vivi-full body interception.}  
3. {Scream a warning-risk your position, but alert the Straw Hats.}  
4. {Unleash a surprise Kiwi Elemental-if you've got it in you.}

ð Make your move, Sensei.

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - ...oh shit Blue!

Too weak to stand, too weak to launch a jet of juice, but enough to will my snaking river of juice to push me faster, faster, faster til I'm a barreling exotic flavored human torpedo.

I might arrive just in time to take a blow

**Tone: Raw Instinct | Mood: Desperate Impact, Bitter Timing**

---

The crowd doesn't notice.

The chaos drowns everything.

Screams, sand, shouting, smoke-it all **blurs** as the four Baroque agents, disguised as royal guards, move in behind **Vivi**.

Their blades are **drawn low**, close to their cloaks. No grand attacks. Just **assassin's work**.

Two steps from striking distance.

---

You round the rubble.

And you see it.

&gt; &quot;...oh shit.&quot;

Your voice barely escapes your throat.

But your body-

It *moves.*

---

You **command the juice.**  
Not to attack. Not to explode.

Just to **push.**

---

A slithering, concentrated **kiwi stream** erupts behind you, **tightening**, **pressurizing**-becoming a **hydraulic piston** aimed dead at destiny.

---

Your body, scraped and bruised, launches forward like a **slightly fruity cannonball**.

**Ribs screaming. Arms shaking. Mouth open in either rage or regret.**

You fly.

You fly in the **worst position** possible-limbs flailing, posture pathetic-

But your **aim?**

**Perfect.**

---

&gt; *WHAM.*

You **slam into the side** of the lead Baroque agent mid-swing, tackling him in a burst of citrus spray.

**He goes down hard.**

You crash through him into the second, sending both skidding into the dust, blades spinning into the sand.

---

The third stumbles back.

The fourth hesitates-too late.

---

You roll, bounce, *bounce again*, and come to a **wheezing, juice-slicked stop** between Vivi and the attackers.

Your body screams.

But you **throw your arm out**, protecting her with the only thing you have left: **presence.**

---

Vivi turns, wide-eyed.

&gt; &quot;Eatone?!&quot;

---

You don't have breath for words.

But your message is clear.

---

&gt; *Not the kid.*

---

And now?

The Straw Hats are turning.

Sanji sees them.

Zoro's sword is already halfway out.

**Too late for a clean kill. Too late for subtlety.**

Your ridiculous, heroic tackle has **blown their cover**, and the momentum has turned.

---

**OOC: You have successfully intercepted the surprise attack.  
Two Baroque agents down. Two more exposed.  
Straw Hats are reacting.  
Vivi is safe.  
You are at zero stamina.**

Would you like to:

1. {Stay down. Just watch it unfold. You've done enough.}  
2. {Say something to Vivi before you pass out again.}  
3. {Try to rise. Pathetic. Heroic. Hilarious.}  
4. {Attempt to summon a final, shaky Kiwi Elemental before losing consciousness.}

ð Final play, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Groan from the pain of headbutting someone in armor. At least the straw hats have them handled. I snake a stream of juice around Vivi as if I was circling the wagons, then curl around her like a particularly protective worm (or viper, if one were feeling charitable). I look up at her, wincing. I've... I've still got your back blue. As long as I'm still breathing.

A pause.

Well considering that I can't get up, it's more like I got your feet, rather than your back.

You're lying in the dirt.

Your skull is ringing from the *headbutt into a breastplate maneuver* (Note to self: **never again**), and your ribs feel like a maraca in a blender.

But you're still there.

**Breathing.**

And **Vivi is alive.**

---

The Straw Hats explode into action behind you-

- **Zoro's swords flash**, parrying and pinning the last two Baroque agents like he's cutting wheat.  
- **Sanji flips into the air**, a boot connecting with a jaw that echoes across the plaza.  
- **Usopp** fires off a slingshot round that bursts in a blinding flash.  
- **Nami**, eyes burning, raises her Clima-Tact and channels a gust of wind to knock the last attacker into a broken stall.

---

You?

You just **groan**.

&gt; &quot;Ughhhh... godsdamn armor helmets...&quot;

You cough. **Something cracks.**  
Could be your pride.

You raise a **shaky finger**, and a **thin coil of kiwi juice** slithers from it, tracing the ground in a tight ring around Vivi. Like a moat. A barrier. A **final warning**.

Then you curl slightly closer, your battered body forming a squishy, wounded spiral near her legs.

&gt; &quot;I've... I've still got your back, Blue.&quot;

You wince hard, twitching from pain, still not looking directly at her.

&gt; &quot;As long as I'm still breathing.&quot;

You look up at her-

Vivi, blinking through tears. Shock. Relief.

You give her a weak, sideways grin.

---

&gt; &quot;Well, considering I can't get up...&quot;

&gt; &quot;...it's more like I got your **feet**, rather than your back.&quot;

---

That gets her.

A weak, exhausted **laugh** escapes her throat, even as the tears flow.  
She drops to her knees beside you, hands hovering-unsure where to touch, where it wouldn't hurt.

&gt; &quot;You absolute idiot...&quot;

&gt; &quot;My idiot.&quot;

She leans forward, wrapping her arms **gently** around your shoulders as chaos still swirls at the edges of the plaza.

But not near her.

Not anymore.

---

**You did it.**

You made it in time.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has been emotionally and physically steadied.
- The Straw Hats have cleared the remaining agents.
- You are alive-barely-but your sacrifice **turned the tide.**
- Tashigi, still watching from above, smiles faintly through the blood.

&gt; *Maybe you're not just a teacher after all.*

---

Would you like to fade out into unconsciousness with style-or stay conscious to witness the beginning of the final confrontation with Crocodile above?

&gt;&gt; USER: Maintain consciousness.

Kohza finally gets to Vivi.

A dry Luffy fisted ineffectively fights Crocodile

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Turning Tide]**  
**Scene: &quot;Truth, Sand, and Stubbornness&quot;**  
**Tone: Threadbare Resolve | Mood: The Tension Before the Final Blow**

---

You're lying on the cobblestones, half-curled around **Vivi**, **conscious only through sheer spite** and the sense of adult responsibility that refuses to die.

Your body is wrecked. You're fairly certain at least **four major joints** are protesting their contracts.

But you're **aware**.

**Watching. Listening.**

---

The dust settles around the plaza-at least for now.

The **Straw Hats** regroup in a loose perimeter, weapons drawn but no longer pressed. For once, the battlefield **pauses.**

**Kohza** finally shoves through the last of the crowd, his cloak torn, face cut and bruised from the riot.

He sees you first.

He falters-**unsure who the hell the green, fruit-smelling guy curled at Vivi's ankles is.**

But then-

He sees **her.**

And she sees **him.**

---

&gt; &quot;Kohza...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Vivi.&quot;

It's not a reunion.

It's not even a moment of peace.

It's **confirmation.**

That both of them are still alive. That they still remember what they fought for.

&gt; &quot;I saw it,&quot; he breathes, stepping closer. &quot;I saw the agents. The lies. *Crocodile.*&quot;

She nods-tears still fresh but *held back.*

&gt; &quot;We can still stop this.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We just need to tell them. Together.&quot;

---

The crowd watches, torn. Not fighting. Not moving. **Waiting.**

For a sign.

For a leader.

For truth.

---

---

**Above...**

**Luffy is punching sand.**

Over and over and over again.

**Fists slam through Crocodile's chest**, his arms, his face-but it's like hitting fog.

&gt; &quot;GOMU GOMU NO-!&quot;

**Swirl. Twist. Miss.**

Crocodile's laughter **rings across the sky**.

&gt; &quot;How does it feel?&quot; he sneers. &quot;To throw your whole strength... and never touch anything at all?&quot;

He **slams a sand-covered fist** into Luffy's side, sending him **tumbling across the rooftop**, coughing, spitting blood.

---

Below, Vivi looks up.

You look too.

She doesn't cry.

She just **tenses**-watching Crocodile tower above her kingdom.

---

You shift slightly, enough to whisper.

&gt; &quot;Dry...&quot;

&gt; &quot;His fruit...&quot;

You cough hard. Acid climbs your throat.

&gt; &quot;He's made of sand... and you're hitting him with fists.&quot;

---

Nami, nearby, snaps her head toward you.

&gt; &quot;You've seen him fight before?&quot;

You nod. Barely.

&gt; &quot;He... he dries things out. Drains moisture. Luffy's... he's fighting without water...&quot;

Your voice trails.

But **someone hears.**

And the seed is planted.

---

**OOC:**
- Kohza and Vivi are reunited.
- The crowd is *finally* still-awaiting their orders.
- Luffy is **failing** to land damage on Crocodile due to **lack of water.**
- You are maintaining consciousness-barely.
- The true final battle is still brewing.

Would you like to:

1. {Try to offer a theory to the crew-how to hurt Crocodile.}  
2. {Push Kohza and Vivi to take control of the crowd.}  
3. {Keep observing, narratively positioning yourself to reenter in a support role.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - C'mon, blue. Rubber boy's buying you time. Do something.

Look around for Tashigi

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Moment to Lead]**  
**Scene: &quot;Her Kingdom, Her Voice&quot;**  
**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Breath Held Across a Nation**

---

You shift on your side, everything aching, every breath a negotiation between pain and consciousness.

But you're watching her-**Vivi**-and you can see it.

She's standing there.

Beside **Kohza**.

Crowd **silent**.

All the pieces are finally aligned.

And she's **frozen**.

---

So you speak.

Your voice is dry and broken, but it **cuts** through the moment like chalk on a blackboard.

&gt; &quot;C'mon, Blue...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Rubber boy's buying you time.&quot;

A wheeze.

&gt; &quot;So do something.&quot;

---

She turns to look at you, the world tilting in her eyes.

---

You glance around instinctively-**looking for Tashigi.**

And from your spot on the ground, you **spot her**:

Slumped at the rooftop edge. One hand gripping stone. **Alive.** Bloody. Watching.

She sees you see her.

And gives you the **smallest nod** of confirmation.

She's out of the fight.

But **she's here.**

---

Back below, **Vivi breathes in.**

A deep, trembling breath.

She steps forward, slightly past Kohza, who meets her glance-and nods.

---

She raises her hands.

Not in surrender.

But to speak.

---

&gt; &quot;Everyone... **listen to me!**&quot;

Her voice shakes at first, then **steadies**.

&gt; &quot;You've all seen it. The fighting. The lies. The people who tried to kill me in my own streets-**dressed as guards!**&quot;

&gt; &quot;You've heard the rumors, the drought, the rebellion-**you've bled for this country**...&quot;

&gt; &quot;And *so have I!*&quot;

She pulls her cloak aside, revealing the slashes across her arm and shoulder.

---

&gt; &quot;But the truth is this: **the enemy was never each other.**&quot;

&gt; &quot;The enemy is a man who thinks kingdoms are things to break open. Who thinks he can take power from under our palace without ever once earning the right to lead.&quot;

---

She points skyward.

At the swirling **sandstorm**.

At the shape of **Crocodile**, toying with a boy made of rubber and will.

&gt; &quot;The enemy is *up there.*&quot;

---

Silence.

Then:

&gt; &quot;...She's right,&quot; Kohza says, stepping beside her.

&gt; &quot;The fighting stops. **Now.**&quot;

---

And the crowd... **listens.**

Swords lower.

Banners are dropped.

Someone begins to kneel.

Then more.

---

**The war is ending.**

**Right here.**

Right now.

Because **she said so.**

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has rallied the crowd. The rebellion has officially ceased.  
- Kohza has lent his authority.  
- Crocodile may or may not be aware of the power shift below.  
- Tashigi is alive, still unable to act.  
- You are still conscious-but on the edge.  

Would you like to:
1. {Push yourself to get a message to Luffy-about Crocodile's weakness.}  
2. {Just rest. You've done enough. The next move is theirs.}  
3. {Call out to Tashigi-if she can move, now's the time.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Lowly remark that even if the war is stopped, there's still the crocodile sized issue in the room to deal with. An issue that's seems to be growing, as Crocodile seems to be growing bored of Luffy 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Calm Before the Sandfall]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Crocodile-Sized Problem&quot;**  
**Tone: Exhausted Realism | Mood: Victory Tainted by What Still Looms**

---

The plaza has stilled.

For the first time since this morning, there is **no shouting**.

No swords clashing. No false flags. No panic.

Only the sound of **wind** whipping across the rooftops.

And the low crackle of **sand building above**.

---

You lie there-juice barely flowing, lungs ragged-and despite the overwhelming relief all around you, **you don't smile.**

Not yet.

You murmur to no one in particular, maybe Vivi, maybe the ground.

&gt; &quot;Even if the war's stopped...&quot;

You swallow hard.

&gt; &quot;There's still the *Crocodile-sized* issue in the room.&quot;

You glance up toward the **rooftop**, where **Luffy is breathing heavy**, clothes torn, sand clinging to his limbs. His **fists are cracked** from the impacts.

**Crocodile?**

**Barely touched.**

---

You watch Luffy **launch another punch**-  
&gt; &quot;Gomu Gomu no Pistol!&quot;

**Crocodile simply parts** into a cloud of sand. Again.

He yawns.

Literally.

---

&gt; &quot;Is that it?&quot; Crocodile says, spinning a tendril of sand around his finger like a bored lecturer with chalk.  
&gt; &quot;Your grand pirate dream riding on this? I expected more from a future corpse.&quot;

He slams a hand into the rooftop, and a **wave of dehydration** spreads across the stone, turning tiles to **dust** beneath Luffy's feet.

---

Luffy stumbles.

He's running out of time.

---

Your voice rasps out again.

&gt; &quot;He's getting bored.&quot;

You cough into your sleeve, something wet and red sticking to your palm.

&gt; &quot;That's when he gets dangerous.&quot;

---

From her rooftop perch, **Tashigi's fingers twitch**, her eyes narrowing. She sees it too.

From the plaza, **Vivi looks up**, her joy dimming at the sight.

From beside her, **Kohza's fists clench.**

---

And around you... the people **watch.**

The rebellion may have ended.

But the **true war** still rages above.

---

**OOC:**
- Crocodile is now entering **second phase**: no longer toying. Luffy is at critical stamina.  
- Crowd is rallying behind Vivi-but helpless against a Warlord.  
- You are too weak to fight-but **not too weak to speak**.

Would you like to:

1. {Speak up: offer the crew the clue to how Luffy can hurt him.}  
2. {Signal Tashigi-pass the torch of action to her, if she can move.}  
3. {Try to conjure a final glob of golden kiwi-wet enough to be... useful?}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Observe with trepidation.

Meanwhile, an angry cloud of smoke of captain rank may or may not be entering the airspace

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Storms Above, Smoldering Below]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Tide Is Still Turning&quot;**  
**Tone: Suspense Building | Mood: Watching the Scales Wobble**

---

You don't move.

You **can't**.

But you **watch.**  
Eyes heavy, heart pounding like a kettle drum someone's spilled a war on.

**Luffy** is staggering now.  
**Crocodile's** grin is wider. Lazier.

Like a predator deciding whether to eat or just savor the taste of fear a little longer.

The rooftop crumbles beneath the dehydration.  
Stone to sand.  
Foundation to nothing.

&gt; *He's not just fighting the boy now,* you think.

&gt; *He's erasing the building from under him.*

---

**Below**, the people stir uneasily. The rebellion's flame has been doused, but the **weight of helplessness** presses down.

Vivi's shoulders are rigid again. Her fists clenched so tightly her knuckles glow white.

---

Tashigi, still sprawled across the palace's lower ledge, tries to push herself up on a trembling elbow-

But stops.

**Even her sword wouldn't reach him now.**

---

Your gaze flicks to the horizon.

**Something's changing.**

There-along the eastern edge of the city skyline-  
the faintest, strangest *wisp* of white.

Not a cloud.

Not smoke from the battle.

&gt; *It's cleaner. Thicker. Angrier.*

It moves **against the wind.**

---

You recognize it.

A **roiling, fuming, cursing** sort of trail.

One that's punched through buildings and bureaucracy alike.

&gt; *No way...*

---

Somewhere far above, in the rapidly crowding skies-

A voice made of gravel and hatred rasps through gritted teeth.

&gt; &quot;You're going to pay for laying a hand on my subordinate.&quot;

---

**Smoker has entered Alubarna airspace.**

And he's not smiling.

---

**OOC:**
- You are observing Crocodile's dominance.  
- Luffy is near the edge of a tactical defeat-first encounter still mimicking canon.  
- Smoker, finally freed (by Robin? By delay timer?), is now approaching the battlefield.

You are the only one who's noticed the smoke.

Would you like to:

1. {Alert the Straw Hats that a Marine storm might be coming.}  
2. {Continue observing, prepared for the chaos about to erupt.}  
3. {Say something ironic or wise. Like a prophecy. Or a teacher's final comment before a field trip goes wildly wrong.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Hey... That's an... Interesting looking cloud.

OOC: Per canon, Smoker is likely no match for Crocodile, would like not want to engage directly. But given what he's seen, his injured subordinate, a warlord on the cusp of victory, he chooses to dive in to fight, even if just to by time for something, anything

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Smoke on the Horizon, Storm at the Summit]**  
**Scene: &quot;A Cloud You Don't Want to Grade Papers With&quot;**  
**Tone: Grave Humor | Mood: A Breath Before Impact**

---

You're still curled up like a **citrus-drenched larva**, too broken to do more than flick juice and twitch your eyebrows.

But you squint toward the sky.

And you see it again.

A thick, rolling **plume of smoke**, parting the desert air like it **doesn't care about physics**, weather, or your good vacation plans.

---

You rasp out, barely audible to the others around you:

&gt; &quot;Hey...&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's an... interesting-looking cloud.&quot;

---

**Nami** glances skyward.  
Her brow furrows.

&gt; &quot;That's not a cloud.&quot;

**Zoro's grip tightens.**  
**Chopper's ears go stiff.**  
**Vivi turns. Her eyes widen.**

Because now, everyone sees it.

And it's not a cloud.

It's a **Marine.**

---

### **Cut to: Above the Palace**

**Luffy hits the rooftop again.**

Coughing. Bleeding. Barely staying upright.

**Crocodile** stands over him, unhurried. Calm. Calculated.

He raises a sand-clawed hand, aiming for Luffy's chest.

---

&gt; &quot;I'm done playing.&quot;

---

And then-

&gt; *THWOOOSH-!*

A **pillar of white smoke** blasts down from above, crashing between the two fighters like a divine exhale.

**Sand collides with smoke**, billowing outward in a thunderous hiss.

The rooftop shakes.

Tiles explode.

**Crocodile stumbles back. Eyes narrowing.**

&gt; &quot;...You.&quot;

---

Standing in the center of the clash, coat billowing, arms crossed, **is Captain Smoker**.

---

&gt; &quot;Warlord or not, I've had it with your games.&quot;

He glances sideways at Luffy-bleeding, swaying, not yet defeated.

&gt; &quot;I don't like pirates...&quot;

&gt; &quot;But I like tyrants even less.&quot;

---

**Luffy grins.**

Because he knows what this means.

**One more second. One more breath. That's all he needs.**

---

Crocodile growls.

&gt; &quot;You think smoke can beat sand?&quot;

&gt; &quot;I think pain buys time.&quot;

Smoker slams his fists together. The white cloud **erupts** outward like a curtain of vengeance.

---

And the rooftop **erupts into chaos.**

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker has entered the fight to **buy time**, not win.
- His attack disrupts Crocodile just as he was preparing a finishing blow on Luffy.
- Luffy now has a **crucial window** to regroup.
- The Straw Hats and Vivi are aware of the marine's arrival.
- You, Sensei, remain the one who first spotted the tide-turning smoke.

Would you like to:

1. {Comment on the situation like a battered war veteran substitute teacher.}  
2. {Try to give tactical advice-how to *actually* hit Crocodile.}  
3. {Just lie there, fully committed to being the most observant human kiwi on the battlefield.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I stare. So... How the hell do we even beat this guy? Do you have any super royal guards in your basement, blue? Now would be a good time

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Tactical Questions From the Ground]**  
**Scene: &quot;An Appropriate Time to Ask for a Miracle&quot;**  
**Tone: Dry | Mood: Tactical Desperation Dressed as Humor**

---

You stare up at the rooftop battleground, **eyes squinting through blood and sand**, watching **smoke and sand clash** like two natural disasters having a very personal disagreement.

&gt; *So that's Smoker...*

You're honestly impressed the guy hasn't been **dissolved yet**, but you're also **keenly aware** that the only reason Luffy is still breathing is because someone **just got angrier than the Warlord.**

But that can't last.

So you mutter-loud enough to catch **Vivi's** attention as she kneels near you, still watching the storm overhead.

---

&gt; &quot;So... how the hell do we even beat this guy?&quot;

Your voice is hoarse, dry, but still lined with sarcasm. That teacher-tone that says *I've graded worse situations before, and they all ended in detention.*

&gt; &quot;Do you have any super royal guards in your basement, Blue?&quot;

A wheeze.

&gt; &quot;Now would be a good time...&quot;

---

**Vivi exhales sharply**, somewhere between a laugh and a sob.

&gt; &quot;No super guards. Just me...&quot;

She trails off.

Then straightens a little.

&gt; &quot;But... we *do* have the Poneglyph.&quot;

---

That draws **Nami's** eyes.

&gt; &quot;What, you think we can *drop it* on him?&quot;

**Usopp** blinks.  
&gt; &quot;Wait, can we?!&quot;

---

**You raise a shaky hand.**

&gt; &quot;Hold up-hold up.&quot;

&gt; &quot;This guy's made of *sand*. You punch him, he falls apart. You slash him, he *laughs*. He drains people *by touching them*. He's got sand *inside* the building...&quot;

You point, weakly, at the clashing **Smoker and Luffy**.

&gt; &quot;He's toying with both a pirate captain and a Marine...&quot;

Then you lock eyes with Vivi.

&gt; &quot;So unless that ancient stone has a juice box hidden in it-&quot;

---

**Zoro, nearby, grunts.**

&gt; &quot;He's right. We're not hurting him like this.&quot;

**Nami frowns, then slowly looks toward you.**

&gt; &quot;You said... he dries things out.&quot;

**You nod.**

&gt; &quot;Yeah. Moisture. That's how he kills.&quot;

**Her eyes widen.**

&gt; &quot;Then the only way to hit him...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Is to be *wetter than he can dry.*&quot;

---

That lands like a thunderclap.

All eyes turn to the rooftop.

To **Luffy**-cracked lips, bruised eyes.

And Crocodile, raising his clawed hand again.

---

They turn back to you.

Specifically, your **fruity-ass self**, laying in a puddle of kiwi juice like a defeated smoothie mascot.

---

**OOC:**
You've reignited the central tactical clue: **Crocodile can be hit if he's soaked.**  
Nami has picked up on the idea.  
Vivi and the crew now understand the path to victory-but must act fast.

Would you like to:

1. {Offer your juice. It's humiliating. But it may just save the brat.}  
2. {Let them figure it out. You've done your part. Fade into the background like a noble citrus casualty.}  
3. {Say something ridiculous but inspirational. Something only a high school teacher with head trauma could say.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - I raise an arm weakly. That's... An interesting idea. But given his power level, I think he can dry me out faster than I can juice. Like a really sad battle of attrition, but it looks like a warlord sucking a crumpling juice box dry

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Citrus Analysis at the End of the World]**  
**Scene: &quot;Do Not Suck the Kiwi Box&quot;**  
**Tone: Gallows Humor | Mood: Genius Hidden Behind Deadpan Despair**

---

You raise your arm.

It shakes like a flag in a light breeze.  
It's sticky.  
It's green.  
You're pretty sure a fly has landed on it at least once this hour.

---

&gt; &quot;That's... an interesting idea.&quot;

Everyone leans in.

Hope flickers across their eyes.

Maybe you have a plan.  
Maybe you're going to **unleash** something.  
Maybe this is your big hero moment.

You sigh.

&gt; &quot;But given his power level, I think he can dry me out faster than I can juice.&quot;

A beat.

Then, you deadpan:

&gt; &quot;Like a really sad battle of attrition.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But it *looks* like a Warlord sucking a crumpling juice box dry.&quot;

---

**Usopp makes a noise that's halfway between a laugh and a horrified whimper.**

**Nami** covers her mouth with a hand, eyes wide, not sure if she's about to giggle or throw up.

**Vivi** just shakes her head in disbelief.

&gt; &quot;You're unbelievable...&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're dying. And you're making jokes about juice boxes.&quot;

---

**Zoro smirks.**

&gt; &quot;He's got a point.&quot;

&gt; &quot;A really messed up one, but a point.&quot;

---

**Chopper stares at you.**

&gt; &quot;You are... medically... very strange.&quot;

---

But something settles in the group.

That tension cracks just a little.

Not relief. Not peace.

But **focus.**

You may not be the final weapon.

But you **reminded them of what Crocodile really is**.

And that's enough.

---

High above, **Smoker stumbles**, his smoke dispersing as Crocodile finally gets a solid hit in-  
a slicing **sand spear** that grazes his shoulder and sends him tumbling to the rooftop edge.

**Luffy staggers upright.**

---

It's almost time.

---

**OOC:**  
- You've reminded everyone of Crocodile's **core weakness**.  
- The Straw Hats are preparing.  
- Luffy is on the cusp of finding his second wind.  
- Smoker's time is almost up-but he's bought the crucial opening.

Would you like to:

1. {Try to assist Luffy with one last juice assist-something to get moisture onto Crocodile.}  
2. {Give Vivi or Nami a final tip. Maybe they can use your fruit.}  
3. {Just rest. If this were a test, you've already passed.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Unless we get like, the entire fire brigade of Alabasta to hit him, I doubt we can out-soak him. And judging by the damage to infrastructure I've seen worming my way here, that doesn't seem like an option.

I stare at Vivi (who is feeling dread once more)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Great Desert Dilemma]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Desperate Conclusion&quot;**  
**Tone: Resolute, with a Touch of Reluctant Acceptance**

---

You look at Vivi, and in her eyes you see the same weariness that's been gnawing at your own. The same dread, like the weight of the entire country pressing down on both of you. It's not something you can easily shake off.  
The whole desert-this whole kingdom-feels like it's slipping between your fingers. And you're not sure you have the strength to hold it back anymore.

---

&gt; &quot;Unless we get like, the entire fire brigade of Alabasta to hit him, I doubt we can out-soak him.&quot;

A humorless laugh bubbles in your chest, though you don't let it escape. 

&gt; &quot;And judging by the damage to infrastructure I've seen worming my way here, that doesn't seem like an option.&quot;

---

You feel the ache in your bones-of blood loss, of exhaustion-and the realization of how small you really are in the grand scheme of this war.

&gt; **&quot;I wish it was.&quot;**

---

Vivi's eyes drop, and for a moment, the fight seems to fade out of her. It's a heavy moment, the kind where you can feel the sky above you, cracked and bleeding, like it might fall any minute.

She opens her mouth to say something, but the words don't come right away.  

---

**Tashigi stumbles back into the scene, battered and grim, her sword nearly dragging on the ground.**  
She's not fully healed, but she's here, and that counts for something.  
The flames of the war still rage in the distance, but it's not her fight anymore. It's yours.

She glances between the group, then locks eyes with you. 

&gt; &quot;Do you have a plan...?&quot;

---

But before you can even respond, the tension shifts. It's the kind of feeling that makes the hairs on your neck stand up. Something's coming.  
Not just from the battle-there's something in the air. The ground beneath you is shifting, the energy vibrating, like a storm is about to break.

You can almost feel it: **Crocodile's next move**. The sense of inevitability.

---

&gt; **You turn back to Vivi, your thoughts spiraling.**

---

She looks back at you. **Tired, but with that spark in her eyes still present.**

&gt; &quot;I know what you're thinking.&quot; She says it with a steadiness that surprises you. **&quot;But this fight isn't over. It can't be.&quot;**

---

You look to the plaza, the struggle still going on. You see Luffy struggling against Crocodile's power, Smoker trying to keep him distracted, the world bending under the weight of their conflict.

And you wonder-will the country ever really find peace?

---

**The weight of all that is too much.**

---

But Vivi gives you a silent nod. She trusts you. Maybe even more than you deserve.

---

&gt; **So now, the only question remains:**  
**What's the next move?**

---

### OOC:  
The group's morale is holding steady, but the clock is ticking.  
- **Crocodile** is growing more dangerous as Luffy continues to tire.  
- **Tashigi** is still in fighting shape, but definitely struggling.  
- **Vivi** is determined to see this through, but the pressure of her responsibilities weighs on her shoulders. 

Do you:  
1. **Try to rally the group for one last push.**  
2. **Concentrate on Crocodile's weakness**-you know it's there, if you can just exploit it.  
3. **Give Vivi one last bit of hope**, even if you don't have the answer.

&gt;&gt; USER: I... I don't suppose you have anything to juice us up, would you, blue?

---

You cough hard enough to rattle your fillings.  
Your voice comes out cracked and half-laughing as you weakly glance at Vivi.

&gt; &quot;I... I don't suppose you have anything to juice us up, would you, Blue?&quot;

The phrasing is ridiculous, but the question isn't.

Because you can **feel the walls closing in**.  
Luffy's blows are **losing power**, even with Smoker's brief distraction.  
Crocodile's patience is **gone**.

And your **juice-based combat tactics** are still funny, but they're not enough to bring down a **warlord made of nightmares.**

---

Vivi's eyes widen, just a little.  
There's a flash of something like shame.

&gt; &quot;There is... one thing.&quot;

Her hand trembles as it reaches into the folds of her cloak.

She pulls out a small, round **vial**-no larger than a finger's width. The liquid inside swirls with a strange silver-blue shimmer. It **glows** faintly.

You recognize it, from a pamphlet you once confiscated from a student who swore it was an energy booster sold in Loguetown.

---

&gt; &quot;*Hero Water.*&quot;

The name alone feels like a slap across the teeth.

She swallows hard.

&gt; &quot;It's dangerous. It doesn't heal. It doesn't fix. It just... forces your body to go beyond its limits.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Anyone who drinks it will gain enough strength to fight at full power again.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;For five minutes.&quot;

Another pause.

&gt; &quot;Then they die.&quot;

---

The group goes dead silent.

Even the sound of Crocodile's storm overhead seems to hush for just a moment.

---

You breathe slowly.

&gt; *Oh. Great.*

&gt; *A literal death drink.*

---

**Tashigi** takes a step forward.

&gt; &quot;We can't ask someone to do that.&quot;

**Zoro** growls.  
&gt; &quot;We're not asking. We're figuring out if it's a last resort.&quot;

**Chopper's** ears droop.  
&gt; &quot;It's... poison. Controlled, focused poison.&quot;

---

**Vivi clutches it tighter.**

&gt; &quot;I was saving it. Just in case...&quot;

She doesn't finish.

But you know what she meant.

---

She was willing to **take it herself** if Crocodile reached the throne room.

---

**OOC:**
You now face a dire choice.  
The **Hero Water** exists. Its power is real-but so is its price.  
Using it could turn the tide... or trade one life for another.

Would you like to:

1. {Insist that no one use it. There has to be another way.}  
2. {Suggest someone specific take it, including yourself.}  
3. {Leave the choice to Vivi-her country, her burden.}  
4. {Try to fake it-simulate the power boost using your fruit to intimidate.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - slowly reach out a shaking arm.

Gimme. Gimme gimme

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Five Minutes to Make a Miracle]**  
**Scene: &quot;One Last Lesson&quot;**  
**Tone: Somber Bravery | Mood: The Quiet Before the Final Bell**

---

There's no drama in it.

No long speech.

No thundering declaration of heroism.

You just reach out your hand-**trembling**, bruised, fingers curled like a dying leaf-and mutter:

&gt; &quot;Gimme.&quot;

A pause.

Then:

&gt; &quot;Gimme gimme.&quot;

---

The Straw Hats freeze.  
**Tashigi** steps forward instinctively, lips parting in protest.  
**Vivi's** eyes go wide.

&gt; &quot;You-no, you can't-!&quot;

You don't raise your voice.

You don't look heroic.

You look like a man with a migraine, a moral compass, and **absolutely no better ideas.**

---

&gt; &quot;Blue, if you've got another tank, another battalion, or a Navy Admiral in your pocket...&quot;

You shrug-your voice bone-dry:

&gt; &quot;...Now's the time.&quot;

Silence.

&gt; &quot;Didn't think so.&quot;

---

**Vivi stares down at the vial.**  
She doesn't want to hand it over. Every line of her posture screams *don't make me.*

But then she looks into your eyes.

And she sees it.

Not resolve.

Not fearlessness.

But that **frustrating, responsible adult instinct**.

The one that made you dive between her and assassins.  
The one that refused to run.  
The one that **teaches** by example-even if it kills you.

---

She places the vial in your palm.

Slow.

Like it might shatter the moment she lets go.

&gt; &quot;Eatone-sensei...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Don't die.&quot;

---

You look at the glass in your hand.

It's tiny. Barely a shot.

Tastes probably like mouthwash mixed with lightning.

---

You smirk, just a little.

&gt; &quot;Hey...&quot;

&gt; &quot;First time I've gotten a drink during school hours.&quot;

---

**OOC: You now possess the Hero Water.**  
Drinking it will give you:  
- Temporary **near-max stamina and physical enhancement**  
- **Heightened Fruit control** (within reason)  
- Ability to **move, fight, and react at full strength for five minutes**  
- **Permanent death** if no medical attention is given after the window closes

You are moments away from making the choice.

Would you like to:

1. {Drink it now. Join the battle above.}  
2. {Wait. Give it to someone else if needed.}  
3. {Offer a final line or joke before you go full juicebox berserker.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - I stare at Vivi, raising an eyebrow. Don't die? I'm pretty sure this guarantees you die.


&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Juice Before Judgment]**  
**Scene: &quot;Dead Man Talking&quot;**  
**Tone: Wry and Grim | Mood: Heartbreaking Humor in Heroism**

---

You stare at the little vial in your palm-barely heavier than a breath, but dense with meaning.

The silver-blue liquid **glints in the desert sun**, swirling like a storm in a bottle.

You look up at **Vivi**, raising an eyebrow like you're checking a homework excuse.

---

&gt; &quot;Don't die?&quot; you echo.

You scoff, weakly.

&gt; &quot;I'm *pretty sure* this guarantees you die.&quot;

---

Her breath catches.

You see the corners of her mouth twitch-*not in amusement*, but in raw, painful disbelief. The kind of expression only someone about to lose something precious wears.

&gt; &quot;It's not funny.&quot;

---

You hold up the vial, squinting at it like you're grading it.

&gt; &quot;Well, it's a little funny.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Dying because I drank bad juice? Honestly on-brand for me.&quot;

---

She steps forward like she might yank it back, like she can undo this moment by sheer force of will-

But she stops.

Because she knows.

You *are* going to drink it.

Because you're not just a teacher.

You're **her teacher.**

And no one hurts your students on your watch.

---

**Tashigi watches silently**, face tight, fists clenched.  
**The Straw Hats are silent.**  
No jokes from Usopp.  
No quips from Sanji.  
Even Zoro's jaw is set.

---

Because they know.

This isn't some clever stunt.

This is the part of the lesson that only the **grown-up in the room** can teach.

---

The bell is about to ring.

And you're **not going to let class end early.**

---

**OOC:**

This is your final moment of choice before drinking the Hero Water.

Would you like to:

1. {Chug it now-launch into the sky and give Crocodile hell.}  
2. {Say one last line to the kids-Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats.}  
3. {Wait-buy just a few more seconds before the final bell.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - observe the others. Slow get to my knees

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Teacher Stands]**  
**Scene: &quot;Eyes on Me&quot;**  
**Tone: Weighted | Mood: The Silence Before Sacrifice**

---

The vial rests in your hand, **cold as dread**.  
The silence around you isn't just tension-it's respect.  
Unspoken, grim, heavy respect.

You've seen it before in the classroom, after a hard truth sinks in.  
This isn't a lecture.  
This is a **lesson no one wants to witness.**

---

You shift.

Your knees scream, but you push through the pain.  
Your **handplants** into the cobblestone.  
One foot slips.  
Then braces.

**You rise.**

Not all the way-but **to your knees**, your spine curving like a man resisting gravity itself.

A man deciding-*no, not yet*.

---

The others watch.

**Vivi's eyes shimmer**, lips parted, the weight of a kingdom behind them.  
She doesn't speak. She can't.  
This is your stage now.

**Tashigi's gaze narrows**, fists clenched so tight her bandages stain red.  
She's fought beside you, bled beside you.

**Chopper stares** with a healer's horror.

**Nami's arms are crossed**, but her face betrays the lump in her throat.

**Sanji lights a cigarette.** Doesn't smoke it.  
Just lights it. For the silence.

**Zoro bows his head.** Quiet. No mocking words.

**Usopp doesn't move.** Doesn't blink.

---

Even **Luffy**, far above, turns his battered face toward the plaza-  
As if something inside him **feels it**.

Feels you.

---

The man who slid into battle on juice, cracked jokes between near-death, and **called himself a teacher** with no army, no crew, no Devil Fruit to break the sky-

Just **kiwi juice and spite.**

---

You look at each of them.

Each of your kids.

Your students.

And you **see it.**

That they're waiting for you to say something.

One last line.

One last *thing they'll remember.*

---

**OOC:**  
Your knees are shaking. The vial is still in your hand.  
You have this **one moment** before fate pushes you forward.

Would you like to:

1. {Deliver a final line-directed to them all.}  
2. {Address someone specific (Vivi, Tashigi, the Straw Hats).}  
3. {Say nothing. Let the act speak for itself.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - well, I sure hope that it doesn't taste too bad. I conjure a tiny kiwi elemental at my feet, just making sure that my power still works before I down the drink. Would be a waste of it only powered me up when I could only throw punches.

I keep the tiny elemental up. I stare at the drink, building resolve. 

OOC: Any objections? (There may be none)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - One Sip From Immortality, or Death]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Last Pretest Check&quot;**  
**Tone: Weighted Anticipation | Mood: Hearts Held at the Edge**

---

You hold the vial steady, fingers curled tight.  
Its glow flickers against your skin-**hero water**, the kind of name a child would trust, and a soldier would die for.

But before you commit, you flick your wrist.

A small **ripple of green** slithers around your heel-  
**a tiny kiwi elemental**, barely the size of a cat, burbling out of the cobblestones with a wobbling grunt.

It blinks at you.

Wobbles.

Then **flexes a stubby arm**.

---

You smirk. It works.  
Your power's still there.  
Not much-but enough to show that **the engine isn't dead**.

You give the little blob a nod.

&gt; &quot;Good. I'd hate to go out just throwing punches.&quot;

---

You stare down at the vial again, the glow now **reflected in the eyes of everyone around you**.

No one's speaking.

Not a single one.

---

**Chopper's hooves twitch**, but he bites his tongue.  
**Tashigi looks ready to stop you**, but her knees don't move.  
**Vivi's holding her breath** like it's the only thing keeping her from screaming.

Even **Luffy**, overhead, watches the glow from the edge of the rooftop, battered and barely standing.

---

They understand now.

This isn't a dramatic stand.

It's a **teacher making damn sure his class gets home safe.**

---

**OOC: There are no objections.**

None dare speak.

None dare stop you.

Because they all know-

**You've already chosen.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Drink the Hero Water now. No more words.}  
2. {Say one last line-to them, to yourself, to fate.}  
3. {Hand the vial to someone else, if you've changed your mind.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Hmm. All or nothing. I raise the vial to my lips...

Only for my arms to cramp at the last second, and the vial falls from my hand.

Oh shit!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Fall of the Hero's Drink]**  
**Scene: &quot;Catch It or Die Trying&quot;**  
**Tone: Absolute Panic | Mood: Fate Rolling on the Sand**

---

The plaza holds its breath.

You raise the vial, glinting bright in the fading sun-  
Your expression serious, resolved.  
A man about to down destiny like a bitter shot of vengeance.

Your fingers curl.  
The vial tilts.  
Liquid shimmers-

---

&gt; *TWITCH.*

Your forearm **seizes**-a last cruel joke from your overused, over-torn, barely-living body.

Your hand jerks.

The vial slips.

&gt; *tink*

&gt; *tink*

&gt; **&quot;OH SHIT-!&quot;**

---

Time slows.

---

The **Hero Water** begins its descent.  
A slow-motion arc of shimmering doom.

The whole plaza watches-**horrified**-as the last hope for a miracle **plummets** toward the dusty stone.

---

**Chopper screams.**  
**Tashigi gasps.**  
**Zoro lunges a half-step-too far.**  
**Nami clutches her head.**  
**Usopp points in sheer disbelief.**

**Vivi's mouth opens but makes no sound.**

---

The tiny **kiwi elemental at your feet** stares at the falling vial.

And does **the one thing it knows.**

---

**It jumps.**

---

With a *splork* and a *splat*, the little blob **launches** its gelatinous self up and out-**body stretching mid-air like a citrus trampoline**-

And **catches the vial in its gooey center**.

It lands with a thud.

Rolls once.

And sits.

Proud.

Glowing faintly.

Still clutching the vial in its wobbling torso.

---

The silence is **staggering**.

Then-

&gt; &quot;WELL OKAY THEN,&quot; you cough, absolutely losing your composure as your heart slams against your ribs like a battering ram.

You stare at the blob.

It wobbles back.

&gt; &quot;...Good job, Juicebox Jr.&quot;

---

You reach forward with your still-trembling hand, **gratefully retrieving** the vial from your **blobby savior.**

You glance back at the crew-every one of them **frozen in suspended disbelief.**

&gt; &quot;I was... just testing your reaction time.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Totally on purpose.&quot;

---

**OOC:**  
- Hero Water was nearly lost.  
- Caught miraculously by your **kiwi elemental**, which now seems... a little smug.  
- The moment shattered tension-but **refocused the group.**
- This is your final moment before the real transformation.

Would you like to finally:

1. {Drink it. No more fumbles. Let the battle begin.}  
2. {Name the blob. It deserves that much.}  
3. {Do both. With style.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - it caught the vial before it shattered... But not before it cracked.

I reach down to the elemental to pick up the vial, only to notice the water rapidly draining out of the bottom into the puddle around the elemental.

Vivi and Tashigi notices too.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Hope That Leaks]**  
**Scene: &quot;A Crack in the Miracle&quot;**  
**Tone: Crushing Realization | Mood: From Glory to Horror**

---

You reach down toward the blob-your loyal little citrus spawn-  
still wobbling proudly with the vial cradled in its gelatinous middle.

The plaza, moments ago a statue garden of **shock and awe**, breathes in again as your hand reaches the vial.

---

But then-

You see it.

So does Vivi.

So does Tashigi.

---

A thin, **silver stream**.

The Hero Water.

**Dripping.**

Not from your fingers.

**From the vial.**

---

A **hairline crack**, nearly invisible, spiderwebs across the glass like a cruel afterthought.  
The impact hadn't shattered it-

It had **wounded it**.

---

And in that moment of tension, in that **delay**,  
the one thing you all feared more than death begins to happen:

&gt; *Drip.*  
&gt; *Drip.*  
&gt; *Drip.*

The precious liquid is bleeding out into the puddle of **kiwi juice** beneath the elemental.  
Diluting.  
Spreading.  
**Soaking into the sand.**

---

You freeze.

The blob stares up at you.

It doesn't understand what it's done.

But **Vivi does.**

Her hands fly to her mouth, her voice breaking.

&gt; &quot;No-no, no, no-&quot;

---

**Tashigi** stumbles forward, eyes wide with alarm, as if sheer willpower might reverse physics.

&gt; &quot;Stop it-get it off the ground! It's-it's leaking!&quot;

---

You scoop the vial-

Too late.

**Half empty.**

Maybe **less.**

The glow is **fading**.

The **miracle is seeping away.**

---

The crowd doesn't know yet.

But the Straw Hats do.

And the look in their eyes is a mixture of **tragedy and furious disbelief**.

---

**OOC:**

You have seconds.  
The Hero Water is nearly gone.

You could:

1. {Drink the remaining contents immediately. It may still work-at reduced potency, and possibly harsher side effects.}  
2. {Try to slurp it up from the puddle-wild, disgusting, but maybe effective.}  
3. {Let it go. It's over. Try to warn Luffy with your final breath.}  
4. {Do something else. Something unhinged, impulsive, or unexpected.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - the remaining droplets drain from the vial when I raise it to my lips again. Oh. Oh no. Oh no no no.

OOC: observe the others reactions.

I kneel down desperately to the puddle of kiwi and heroism, about to drink off the sandy cobblestone, when suddenly... 

(Pause)

**Scene: &quot;The Taste of Dust and Desperation&quot;**  
**Tone: Gutting | Mood: All or Nothing, and Mostly Nothing**

---

You lift the vial to your lips again, clenching your jaw, ready to die gloriously and violently for the kids, the country, and the curriculum-

But when you tilt it back...

&gt; *drip...*  
&gt; *...nothing.*

Just a whisper of air.

The **last drops** escape past your lips.

---

&gt; &quot;Oh.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Oh no.&quot;

You shake it.

No glow.

No miracle.

Only a drop of shame and a faint citrus aftertaste.

---

You stare at the empty glass like it's just flunked your best student.

---

&gt; &quot;Oh no no no...&quot;

You drop to your knees, ignoring every scream from your wounds, every insult from your spine, and every ounce of remaining dignity.

You stare down at the **puddle**.

A shallow mixture of **Hero Water and kiwi juice**, soaking into **gritty cobblestone** and flecked with **desert dust**.

Your last chance.  
Diluted.  
Polluted.  
Ruined.

And you do what **no one** expected:

You **lean in**.

Like a man about to suck hope off the bathroom floor.

---

**The Straw Hats' faces:**

- **Usopp:** &quot;...He's not really gonna-&quot;
- **Nami:** &quot;Oh my GOD he is.&quot;
- **Chopper:** &quot;NO, WAIT, THAT'S UNSANITARY!!&quot;
- **Zoro:** (half a blink, slow shake of the head)
- **Sanji:** &quot;Respect. But, goddamn.&quot;

---

**Tashigi stares. Speechless.**

**Vivi steps forward, hand half-raised.**

&gt; &quot;Wait-Eatone-*don't-*&quot;

---

**Then-suddenly-**

The air shifts.

Not a gust. Not Crocodile.

Something else.

A **light splash** beneath your fingers.

You freeze.

Look down.

And see the **tiny kiwi elemental**, wobbling quietly-

Its gooey little body **swollen**, rippling with a faint silver-blue shimmer.

Its stubby arms raised.

Eyes-if you can call them that-locked on you.

---

The blob **absorbed the mix.**

**All of it.**

---

And now it's **glowing.**

---

**OOC:**

The diluted Hero Water didn't vanish-it was **absorbed by your elemental.**  
Its glow now pulses **faintly but rhythmically**, rippling inside the semi-liquid body like a bottled storm.

It's not dead.  
It's not human.  
But it's **something.**

Would you like to:

1. {Command the elemental-use it. All in.}  
2. {Fuse with it. Attempt to let it act as your new power source.}  
3. {Let it decide what to do. It's a part of you, after all.}  
4. {Something unexpected. Something wild.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 4 - âUhhh...?

I'm suddenly knocked off my feet, as the little elemental I was kneeling over explodes like a verdant pillar, reaching to the sky. It grows, the it's cascading base growing in width, knocking me off my knees, and I crash into Vivi and Tashigi behind me.

OOC: The elemental is separate from me, for now

**Tone: Awe-Struck Mayhem | Mood: Tropical Divinity Descends**

---

&gt; &quot;Uhhh...?&quot;

It's the last thing you manage to mumble before the world turns green.

---

The **tiny elemental**, once barely knee-height and endearingly lumpy, suddenly **tenses**. Its round shape **quivers**-like someone just lit a fuse inside a fruit-shaped water balloon.

---

And then-

&gt; **BOOM.**

A *verdant column* **erupts skyward**, exploding upward from the puddle like a geyser of tropical power.  
It **blasts through the air** with a sound like a *thunderclap wrapped in splashback*.

---

You're knocked **clean off your feet**, juice-soaked and stupefied.

&gt; &quot;GAH-!&quot;

You sail back like a tossed sack of overripe groceries, colliding full-force into **Vivi** and **Tashigi**, sending all three of you into a **very undignified, citrusy dogpile**.

---

&gt; *THUD.*  
&gt; *&quot;Oof!&quot;*  
&gt; *&quot;Mmphf-!&quot;*

---

The crowd gasps.

And in front of them-

**Something monstrous takes shape.**

---

The **pillar of emerald** collapses inward, compresses, then reshapes-  
forming massive **arms**, a **torso**, and a churning, bubbling **core** that glows silver-blue like an unstable star.

A new **kiwi elemental** rises.

But not tiny.

This one is **twenty feet tall**, shoulders wide as a ship, with swirling liquid veins pulsing like fire through gelatin.

Its eyes glow.

And then it roars.

&gt; **RRRRAUUUUUGHHHH!!**

Juice sprays from its open maw like vaporized sugar.

---

**The Hero Water didn't empower *you*.**

It **evolved your fruit.**

And gave life to something **outside you.**

**Independent. Powerful. Unstable.**

---

**Crocodile's sandstorm halts.**  
The crowd turns.  
Even **Luffy**, mid-fight, stares down at the plaza below.

&gt; &quot;...What the hell is that?&quot;

---

**Zoro mutters:**

&gt; &quot;Is that... pineapple guy's Stand?&quot;

**Usopp:**

&gt; &quot;It's *alive?!*&quot;

**Sanji:**

&gt; &quot;...That thing looks like it could take on the Sea Kings.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- The kiwi elemental has *absorbed* the diluted Hero Water.
- It now stands as a semi-autonomous **powerhouse**, glowing with fruit-based rage and unknown limits.
- It's not directly under your control-but it *knows* you. And it *knows your will*.
- Crocodile has taken notice.
- Vivi and Tashigi are stunned (and slightly squished beneath you).

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt to command the elemental. It might respond.}  
2. {Try to stand. Rally. Lead. It might listen to leadership.}  
3. {Say something really dumb as you lay in the arms of two women beneath a juice god.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - I... I didn't know fruit could roar.

**Scene: &quot;Fruit Doesn't Normally Do That&quot;**  
**Tone: Ridiculous Awe | Mood: Shock and Tropics**  

---

The **kiwi elemental towers** above the plaza now-arms flexed, back arched, chest heaving with mist and purpose. The Hero Water surges visibly in its chest cavity like a **molten tropical reactor**, its core a churning mix of **silver-blue light and viridescent juice**.

Every living being in Alubarna has stopped what they're doing. The war. The arguments. The cheering. The crying.

They are all, to a person, just **staring** at this **glowing, fruit-flavored titan.**

---

**You, meanwhile, are lying tangled in a half-crushed pile of royalty and justice**, your limbs draped over **Tashigi's lap**, your back against **Vivi's hip**, blinking upward at the skyscraper of kiwi pulp now howling your emotional state into the heavens.

You murmur:

&gt; &quot;I... I didn't know fruit could roar.&quot;

---

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; &quot;W-what did you *do?*&quot;

**Vivi:**  
&gt; &quot;What is it *doing??*&quot;

---

Above, the elemental takes a step forward-  
**cobblestones shatter** beneath its translucent feet, juice splashing in all directions like a living tsunami.

Its fists clench.

Its body twists toward the palace.

Its **eyes lock on Crocodile.**

---

And from atop the roof-

**Crocodile frowns.**

For the first time.

---

He watches this emerald juggernaut take its first proper steps into **his battlefield**.

He mutters:

&gt; &quot;...What kind of Devil Fruit *is that?*&quot;

---

And beside him, **Luffy grins.**

A tired, bloodied grin.

&gt; &quot;That's our juice guy.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- You have summoned a one-time **Fruit Awakening manifestation**, supercharged by Hero Water.
- The elemental is **autonomous**, powerful, and acting in defense of you and Vivi.
- Crocodile is officially concerned.
- You, meanwhile, are still horizontal, injured, and incredibly confused.

Would you like to:
1. {Attempt to psychically influence the elemental through shared will.}  
2. {Let it go-see what it does next.}  
3. {Try to stand. Say something leader-like. Probably fall over again.}

Your head's pounding.  
Your ribs are basically a jigsaw puzzle.  
You're sprawled across two confused women.  
And there's a **25-foot glowing juice elemental** standing on the battlefield like it owns the mineral rights.

---

So you do the only thing that makes sense.

You dig your **bloody fingers into the stone**, push yourself halfway upright, and with the voice of a man who just watched a kingdom burn, scream:

&gt; &quot;**GO!! GET THAT MOTHAFUCKA!!!**&quot;

---

Your voice echoes across the plaza like a war horn made of citrus rage.

The elemental reacts **instantly**.

Its massive form twitches once-then shudders-then **lets loose a second roar**, this one loud enough to rattle windows and send a dozen seagulls flapping madly from the city walls.

It turns.

It **points a single dripping, glowing finger** at **Crocodile**.

Then it **launches forward**, each step a crater, each movement liquid thunder.

---

**Crocodile's eyes widen.**  
He barely has time to react.

&gt; *CRASH!*

A colossal **fist of gelatinous might** slams down on the rooftop, **obliterating part of the palace corner**-  
**Crocodile leaps back**, sand swirling protectively, but he's **on the defensive** for the first time.

---

**Luffy, seeing the opening, lunges.**

&gt; &quot;Gomu Gomu no-&quot;

&gt; **&quot;GATLING!!!&quot;**

A barrage of fists rain in behind the elemental's assault.

Sand clashes with juice.

**Steel clashes with pulp.**

Hero Water **sizzles** through Crocodile's defenses.

The rooftop becomes a **maelstrom of fruit, fists, and fury.**

---

Below, the crowd **explodes** with cheers and terrified awe.

---

**Usopp:** &quot;I knew he was hiding something! He had *kaiju energy*!&quot;

**Zoro:** &quot;That thing's stronger than *me.* I hate that it's stronger than me.&quot;

**Nami:** &quot;If it wins, I'm naming it âSmoothie.'&quot;

---

Vivi and Tashigi both stare in awe as the elemental **plows through Crocodile's outer sand barrier**, **driving him back across the roof.**

You?

You just slump down again, exhausted.

But grinning.

---

&gt; &quot;Good boy...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Teach him what pulp can do.&quot;

**OOC:**
- Your command was heard. Loud and clear.
- The Kiwi Elemental is now engaged in **full-scale battle** with Crocodile, giving Luffy an opening to land real hits.
- The tide of battle is turning.

Would you like to:
1. {Keep watching. Offer commentary. Maybe cry. Just a little.}  
2. {Pass out, dramatically. You've earned the nap.}  
3. {Attempt one final fruit-powered support act, even from the ground.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Force myself to stay awake. The elemental might disperse if I pass out. I sure am having trouble though, that concussion from the armored headbutt is rearing its ugly head again.

Vivi and/or Tashigi may notice

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Holding the Thread]**  
**Scene: &quot;Juice and Willpower&quot;**  
**Tone: Desperate | Mood: Quiet Tension Beneath Roaring Chaos**  

---

You're shaking.

Vision's blurring.  
Ears ringing.  
The roar of the battle above is like thunder filtered through a waterlogged megaphone.

But you stay conscious.

**You *have* to.**

Because that **thing up there**-that roaring, silver-veined Kiwi Titan-**it's still you.**  
Still connected.

Still running on the last dregs of **your willpower**.

And if you **go out**, it might too.

---

&gt; &quot;Not yet... can't... sleep now...&quot;

You press your palms into the warm, juice-slick cobblestone, trying to ground yourself-literally and figuratively. The sand grits into your scraped skin.

A slow, **metallic throbbing** pulses at the back of your skull.

The **concussion** is back in full force.  

Every heartbeat feels like a drum being played by a vengeful taiko demon.

---

Above, you hear the elemental roar again-**fist connecting with sand**, its weight shaking the palace rooftop. Luffy's voice cuts through, hoarse and furious.

&gt; &quot;Take this, bastard!!&quot;

---

But your eyelids are slipping.

The corners of your vision begin to close in, **tunneling into shadows**.

&gt; *No. Not yet. Not yet.*

---

You feel a touch.

Two, actually.

**Vivi's hand on your chest.**

**Tashigi's at your wrist.**

---

Vivi's voice is soft but full of rising panic.

&gt; &quot;He's crashing. He's crashing-Tashigi, what do we do?!&quot;

**Tashigi's hand clenches.** Her jaw is tight.

&gt; &quot;He's still connected to that thing... if he passes out, we might lose our only edge.&quot;

She leans close-sweat-streaked, bloodied, but focused.

&gt; &quot;Eatone. *Sensei.* Stay with us.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You started this lesson. You *finish* it.&quot;

---

You blink.  
Barely.

You try to respond. Your mouth forms syllables that might be words, might be fruit-related nonsense.

---

Vivi moves closer, placing both hands on your cheeks, eyes wide and glistening.

&gt; &quot;You're not allowed to die like this. Not until we've won.&quot;

---

Above, a **sand spear slices through the elemental's arm**. It reforms-slower this time. Your breathing falters.

The connection is growing thin.

---

**OOC:**

You're holding on-barely.  
Your consciousness is the **thread** keeping the Kiwi Elemental fighting.

Would you like to:

1. {Say something to keep yourself anchored-to Vivi, Tashigi, or the crew.}  
2. {Push through with a desperate fruit technique-transfer control? Boost the elemental?}  
3. {Try to rally the elemental with emotion-through memory, conviction, or will.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - Murmur in a very distinctly near-unconscious way. Something about having to do my taxes

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Near the Edge of Sleep and Stupidity]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Things We Die Thinking About&quot;**  
**Tone: Tragicomedy | Mood: Barely Clinging to the World**  

---

Your body's a **wreck**.  
Your skull feels like it's been used to cork a cannon.  
The world around you blurs into bright streaks of battle and the warm smother of concerned hands.

---

You try to say something meaningful.  
Heroic. Impactful. Maybe something Luffy would yell from a rooftop.

But your **mouth**-your **teacher's soul**-has other plans.

---

&gt; &quot;...didn't even finish...&quot;

Your lips move against Vivi's trembling hands.  
Your voice is barely a whisper, like sand pouring through torn parchment.

&gt; &quot;...the form for the... income declaration...&quot;

A wheeze.

&gt; &quot;...owe the Treasury like... thirty thousand beri...&quot;

A faint choke. You try to swallow, but you mostly taste dust and kiwi.

&gt; &quot;...I think I counted the bounty money *twice*...&quot;

---

**Vivi stares.**

**Tashigi blinks.**

**Zoro slowly turns his head.**

&gt; &quot;Did he just say-&quot;

**Sanji:** &quot;Yeah.&quot;

**Usopp:** &quot;He's dying... and he's thinking about his *taxes.*&quot;

---

**Nami:**

She clutches her head.

&gt; &quot;That's it. He's officially one of us.&quot;

---

Above, the **elemental's core flickers**-but pulses stronger.  
Almost like it heard the muttered bureaucratic regret of its creator...

And it **roars. Again. Louder.**  
Kiwi energy flares. **Crocodile reels**.

---

Tashigi leans in again, voice low, biting back a laugh and a sob.

&gt; &quot;You're not allowed to die while owing back taxes, Sensei.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're *staying awake*, and *you're paying those goddamn fees*-got it?&quot;

---

Your eyelids flutter.

You grunt softly. Somewhere between a whimper and a citrus-flavored curse.

---

**OOC:**

You're right on the edge, teacher.

Your brain is clearly **running on fumes**, but your **connection to the elemental strengthens briefly**-as if even your subconscious refuses to let this be your last thought.

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt to speak again. Force yourself back with another thought, ridiculous or real.}  
2. {Let your body stay still, but mentally guide the elemental one last time.}  
3. {Give the floor to the elemental-it may now act on instinct. Its instinct is... yours.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - my consciousness starts fading away.

The elemental slows down a touch. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Rooftop &amp; Plaza - The Thread Frays]**  
**Scene: &quot;Sleep of the Teacher&quot;**  
**Tone: Quiet Dread | Mood: Fragile, Fading Connection**  

---

Your eyes flutter.

The pressure behind them is a thundering drumbeat now.  
Your chest rises once. Slowly.  
Then again-shallower.  

Your blood feels **thin**, and your breath tastes like citrus and dust.

You feel like you're **sinking into your own body**.

The world spins.

---

Your thoughts fracture-fleeting shards of memory and sensation.

- **A school bell ringing.**  
- **Juice boxes being passed around.**  
- **A student asking if Devil Fruits count as &quot;vegetables.&quot;**  
- **You, correcting the spelling of âhomicide' on a bounty form.**  
- **A voice saying: &quot;Don't die, Sensei.&quot;**

---

**The lights begin to dim.**

---

Up on the palace roof, the **Kiwi Elemental's** pace begins to **slow.**

Its movements-once thunderous, now **lagging**, deliberate.  
Its glowing veins pulse-sluggish.  
One fist misses its mark by inches.  
**Crocodile slips free**, a malicious grin returning to his face.

&gt; &quot;I knew it wasn't yours to wield.&quot;

---

**Luffy stares.**

**Eyes wide. Jaw clenched.**

&gt; &quot;No... come on... don't give out on us now...&quot;

---

Back below-

**Tashigi sees it.**

**Vivi feels it.**

The link is fraying.

---

You-barely aware-feel something shift.

Like a **classroom being abandoned before the last question is answered**.  
Like the **lesson ending** before the test is done.

---

You don't want to go.

But your body is shutting down.

---

**OOC:**

Your next breath might be your last unless something intervenes.  
The elemental is fading in tandem.

Would you like to:

1. {Let go. Drift into unconsciousness. Trust in the others.}  
2. {Call out mentally-desperately-to the elemental. One last command.}  
3. {Reach for someone-Vivi, Tashigi, anyone. Try to tether yourself with their presence.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - Something about Snack Pack, the Bananagator. Also the two blurry figures in my vision.

OOC: the elemental, while big, is relatively slow, and hasn't been able to land anything other than glancing hits, so crocodile is only lightly moistened. However, Luffy is fully coated with liquid. Smoker is injured.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Fading Light and the Fractured Mind]**  
**Scene: &quot;Juice, Dreams, and the Edges of Reality&quot;**  
**Tone: Desperate | Mood: Surreal, Slipping Sanity**  

---

Your fingers twitch on the stone.

The world has gone **soft around the edges**, like wet chalk left out in the rain. Sounds are **muted**, warped-your heartbeat is a distant drum. Your skin is buzzing, but your limbs feel like they're filled with pudding and regret.

You blink once.

Twice.

**Vision swims.**

Everything in front of you is a wash of **bright sand and green vapor**, and in the middle of it-

&gt; **Two blurry silhouettes.**

One is **small, hunched**, protective. The other **tall, sturdy**, maybe holding something.

And somewhere in the blur-

You see it.

**Snack Pack.**

A Bananagator.

Majestic. Beautiful. Emotionally unstable and weirdly fast for its size.

---

You exhale.

A wheeze, more breath than voice.

&gt; &quot;...Snack Pack...&quot;

Your cracked lips try to form more.

&gt; &quot;He... he never got his final race...&quot;

Your voice breaks. You don't even know who you're talking to.

&gt; &quot;He had so much more... to give...&quot;

---

You reach forward, blindly, your hand **fumbling in the air**.

Vivi sees it first-her instincts kick in.

She reaches down, **grabs your hand**, clutches it tight.

&gt; &quot;I've got you. You're not going anywhere.&quot;

Tashigi presses her palm to your forehead, trying to stabilize you, even as your skin grows cold.

---

&gt; &quot;Don't let him die here,&quot; she whispers.  
&gt; &quot;*Don't let this be his last class.*&quot;

---

Above, the **elemental lurches.**

It slows-

Then stops-

Then trembles-

---

And its **head turns**.

Toward you.

Toward your flickering life.

Its creator.

---

The glow in its chest **brightens**.

Its movements **change**.

No longer sluggish, lumbering. No longer trying to bludgeon Crocodile into submission-

Instead, it **flickers**-**pressurizes**-

**Concentrates.**

---

It looks at **Luffy**, slick with juice.  
It looks at **Crocodile**, smug, confident, *barely wet enough to be annoying.*

And the elemental **roars again**-

But this time it's not a war cry.

It's a **warning.**

---

OOC:  
- Your unconscious plea and Vivi's presence have **tethered you to consciousness**-for now.  
- The elemental has recognized your weakness, and is about to make a **choice.**  
- Luffy is primed. Crocodile is still slippery-but vulnerable, if timed right.  
- **Snack Pack's memory has been honored.**

Would you like the elemental to:

1. {Transfer its remaining moisture and Hero Water into Luffy-all in, one chance.}  
2. {Perform a final attack-pin or bind Crocodile to give Luffy a guaranteed hit.}  
3. {Disperse in an explosion of pressurized juice, soaking the field-maximizing Luffy's impact.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - snack pack isn't enough. Continue losing more and more consciousness

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Final Descent]**  
**Scene: &quot;A Teacher's Fade&quot;**  
**Tone: Slow Collapse | Mood: Beautiful, Crushing Silence**

---

You feel their hands-**Vivi's grip** tightening around yours, **Tashigi's trembling fingers** brushing across your temple-but their voices are growing **distant**.

Not just quiet.

**Far.**

As though they're speaking from across a canyon filled with fog.

---

Your mind drifts.

Not with grandeur. Not with slow-motion flashbacks or heroic last thoughts.

But with the ridiculous, the mundane.

- The sound of chalk on a board.  
- A classroom door squeaking.  
- The weird lumpy feeling of sitting on a half-squashed fruit during lunch duty.  
- **Snack Pack.**

---

&gt; &quot;...I really liked that gator...&quot;

Your voice is barely audible.

&gt; &quot;...he was fast... I bet he cheated though...&quot;

&gt; &quot;...they always cheat in those races...&quot;

---

Your head slips against Tashigi's arm.

The plaza's war is just **background static now.**

---

Your final thread of lucidity begins to unspool.

You don't even feel afraid.

Just **cold.**

So tired.

---

Up on the rooftop-

**The Kiwi Elemental pauses.**

Its glowing eyes dim.

It lowers its arms.

Not in defeat.

But in **grief.**

---

You were its creator.

Its parent.

And it **felt you slipping.**

---

And then...

The glow inside it **shifts.**

Flickers.

Brightens again.

Brighter than before.

Not just juice.

Not just Hero Water.

But...

**Purpose.**

---

Because maybe this isn't about fighting anymore.

Maybe it's about **delivering a legacy.**

---

**OOC:**  
Your character has reached the brink of unconsciousness.  
You are no longer able to issue commands.  
Your elemental-powered by Hero Water, instinct, and your emotional tether-will now act on its own.

Next scene:  
**&quot;Final Lesson: Impact&quot;**

Would you like to:

1. {Watch it unfold through the haze. Fragmented, dreamlike.}  
2. {Fully pass out. Let the narrative move without your awareness, until someone brings you back.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âScene shift: Tashigi and Vivi's POV. Do they try anything?

The Kiwi Elemental slows to a crawl, standing aimlessly. Crocodile is pleased by this turn of events. Luffy's punches are still occasionally landing, though

OOC: the kiwi elemental is now fully unresponsive, likely to anything

**Scene: &quot;Between Titans, Between Breaths&quot;**  
**Tone: Desperate Stillness | Mood: Too Quiet, Too Soon**  

---

**Tashigi's arms are locked around him now-**  
her knees dug into the juice-slick stone,  
trying to steady **his sagging frame**.

Her voice shakes as she speaks, even as she tries to mask it with Marine precision.

&gt; &quot;He's not... He's not responding anymore.&quot;

The words cut through **Vivi** like a knife.  
She leans over, one hand on his shoulder, the other braced on her own trembling knee.

&gt; &quot;He's... still breathing. Right?&quot;

**Tashigi doesn't answer.**

Because she's not sure.

---

Up above, the **Kiwi Elemental**-once a gleaming symbol of citrus divinity-now stands motionless.

Its gelatinous arms hang low, twitching faintly, like a puppet whose strings have been abandoned mid-pull.

**Its glow dims.**

Not with death-

But with **disconnect.**

---

Crocodile sees it.

He **straightens**, satisfied. The slow grin returns.

&gt; &quot;So the juice finally ran dry.&quot;

He slashes his hand outward-**a slicing sand arc** rips through the air.

The Elemental takes the hit-

&gt; *SHHHHRRKKK*

-and does **nothing**.

No counter. No roar.  
Just **a heavy, wet lurch**, as though gravity is finally catching up.

---

Luffy charges in again, breathing like a wild animal.  
His body is still soaked. His fists still glowing.  
He lands a blow-  
&gt; *BAM!*

**Crocodile stumbles back.**

But only slightly.

---

The momentum is breaking.

---

**Back below-Tashigi's voice sharpens.**

&gt; &quot;We need to wake him up.&quot;

Her hand slaps Eatone's face gently-then harder.

&gt; &quot;Eatone. Sensei. Wake the hell up!&quot;

Nothing.

---

**Vivi's eyes dart between the battle above and the man below.**

The teacher who stopped the assassin.  
Who protected her in Rainbase.  
Who called her *Blue* and always stood between her and the blast zone.

And now?

He's slipping away.

---

She looks up again.

At the **towering Elemental**, twitching like a dying lighthouse.

At the **battle barely being held** by a boy with rubber bones and pure grit.

&gt; &quot;We have to do *something!*&quot;

---

**OOC:**  
Both Tashigi and Vivi are desperate, exhausted, and unsure how to reengage the Elemental-or rouse you.

The Elemental is now **functionally unresponsive.** The link is fading.

Would you like them to:

1. {Try a last-ditch emotional plea-words to Eatone, not the Elemental.}  
2. {Attempt to create a physical reaction-move his body, apply pressure, or stimulate senses.}  
3. {Try something unorthodox-combine Vivi's knowledge and Tashigi's discipline in a risky plan.}  
4. {Leave it up to them, and see what happens.}

**Tashigi** kneels lower, her brow beaded with sweat, hand cupping the back of your head. Her voice is **tight, authoritative**, trained, but **strained by fear.**

&gt; &quot;Eatone! That Elemental's *your* fruit! Your power! You have to stay awake or it's going to fall-and Luffy with it!&quot;

She slaps your cheek again-harder.  
&gt; &quot;We're not done yet, dammit! Don't you *dare* leave a job half-done!&quot;

---

**Vivi**, chest heaving with panic, kneels beside her.  
Her hands tremble, but she grabs your hand again.  
She holds it between hers like it's the last tether to her sanity.

&gt; &quot;Please. Sensei...&quot;

&gt; &quot;You can't go out like this.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We need you.&quot;

She leans in closer. Her voice softens-but cracks:

&gt; &quot;*I* need you.&quot;

---

Still nothing.

But then-

Vivi looks at the **draining color** of the elemental.  
She glances at the sticky **kiwi trail around the stone**.

She remembers.

---

&gt; &quot;Your fruit responds to will. To protection.&quot;

She pulls a flask from her side-**water.** A tiny bit.  
Just enough.

She splashes it on your chest. **Cold.**  
A shock to the system.

---

**Tashigi follows suit.**

Unbuttons your coat, presses her hand firmly to your sternum.

&gt; &quot;Stimulus. Pain triggers. Anything we can.&quot;

She pulls her glove off and **pinches your side hard.**

&gt; &quot;Get up. You *idiot*. You beautiful, stubborn, terrified idiot-&quot;

---

**Vivi leans forward again, lowering her voice.**

&gt; &quot;Snack Pack would've wanted you to see the next race.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And I think... I think I would too.&quot;

---

**Above-**

The Elemental sways.

A faint pulse from its chest.

The **dim light flickers**.

Waiting.

**OOC:**  
All three methods have been deployed:

- **Emotional Plea (Vivi)**  
- **Physical Stimulus (Tashigi)**  
- **Unorthodox Combined Trigger (Water + Pressure + Memory)**

1. {Respond to one, with partial consciousness.}  
2. {Respond to multiple. Fragmented. Slurred.}  
3. {Stay quiet. Let the dice roll.}

**Scene: &quot;The Unmoving Man&quot;**  
**Tone: Collapsing | Mood: The Quiet Before the Breath**

Tashigi's slap rings out across the plaza.

The splash of water on your chest beads and rolls down.

Vivi's fingers tighten around your hand until her own go white.

The air is charged-alive with *trying*.

But you?

You're still.

---

No twitch.  
No breath change.  
No flicker behind your eyelids.

You're a **statue in pulp-stained clothes**, as motionless as the Elemental you birthed.

---

Tashigi bites back a curse, leaning down, forehead against yours.

&gt; &quot;You *absolute bastard*... Don't you dare do this to her. Or to me.&quot;

---

Vivi's voice begins to crack.

&gt; &quot;Please... Just... Just wake up.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We've come so far. We're *right here*. I need-&quot;

She chokes on the last word. Doesn't finish it.

---

**Above-**

The Elemental groans.

A deep, whale-like reverberation of confusion and loss.

It doesn't collapse.

But it lowers its fists.

It doesn't protect.

But it doesn't leave.

It **waits.**

---

**Crocodile laughs.**

&gt; &quot;There it is.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The limits of sentimentality.&quot;

---

The sandstorm around him tightens.

Luffy stumbles.  
His legs buckling.  
The final round drawing near.

---

And still-

You lie there.

Unmoving.

Unbreathing.

Unyielding...?

---

**OOC:**

You remain **completely unresponsive.**  
The Elemental is **not dispersing**-but fully inert.

Vivi and Tashigi are now at the brink of collapse, physically and emotionally.  
The **next trigger** must be something beyond them.

Another voice.

Another presence.

Or the final roll of fate itself.

Scene pending.

---

**Tashigi** remains hunched over you, one hand braced on your chest, the other cradling your head as if physical contact could force a heartbeat. Her expression is taut-**trained Marine composure shredded**, replaced by bare, unshielded pain.

&gt; &quot;He's gone,&quot; she whispers-**and it isn't a statement.**

It's a **threat** to the world.  
A **dare** to the universe to prove her wrong.

---

**Vivi** stares at you with wide, desperate eyes, **her hands trembling in her lap**. Her breath stutters, chest rising and falling, **caught somewhere between fury and heartbreak.**

She's lost so many people.

She told herself she wouldn't lose anyone else.

Not him.

---

&gt; &quot;You're not supposed to go yet,&quot; she says, barely audible.

She clutches your hand tighter, even as your fingers remain limp in hers.

&gt; &quot;You told me I wasn't alone. You told me someone would help carry this.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You told me the *kids* shouldn't carry it...&quot;

A sob slips through her voice.

&gt; &quot;Then why are you making me?&quot;

---

Tashigi leans closer to you, her forehead resting against your bruised temple.

Her tone softens.  
It's not a Marine's bark now.

It's a **friend's whisper**.

&gt; &quot;You jumped in front of me in the hallway. You dragged yourself across the palace floor.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You summoned a god out of *juice*.&quot;

A choked laugh escapes her lips-**not humor. Shock. Grief.**

&gt; &quot;You did all that, and you're seriously going to quit *now*?&quot;

---

No answer.

No movement.

---

The wind kicks up around them-**grit and sand flurrying** across the plaza.

The storm above is **closing in**.

The Elemental stands, wavering like a candle wick moments before it gutters out.

---

Vivi wipes her eyes roughly, furious at herself, and sets her jaw.

&gt; &quot;Fine.&quot;

She leans in, lips close to your ear, and says it:

&gt; &quot;I'm not letting you die, Sensei.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Because if you do... I swear I'll find a way to *drag you back* myself.&quot;

---

Tashigi smirks through clenched teeth.

&gt; &quot;And I'll *kick your ass* if she doesn't.&quot;

---

The two women sit with you-still.  
Refusing to leave.  
Refusing to **let go**.

---

Above...

**Crocodile draws his arm back.**

A jagged spiral of sand winds around his wrist like a hungry serpent, forming a weapon sharp enough to split stone.

He **locks eyes with Luffy**, and speaks with pure venom.

&gt; &quot;Let's end this farce.&quot;

---

The sky **darkens.**

The **crowd screams.**

And your girls?

They don't move.

They **just hold on.**

Vivi and Tashigi's scene reaches its **emotional peak**-both refusing to accept your death.

Their voices may have seeded something.

The world is **moments** from collapse.

If anything is to awaken in you-it must be **now**, or never.

**Darkness.**

Not the peaceful kind.  
Not velvet or gentle or womb-like.

This is the **buzzing black** of a mind short-circuiting.  
A half-lit classroom during a power outage.  
A **suspended awareness**, drifting somewhere between detention and death.

---

You float.

No, you're grounded.

Wait-are you sitting?

Lying?

Your body's somewhere, but your brain **doesn't have the blueprints anymore**.

---

What you *do* have is sensation.

Weird, illogical, very **soft**, very **invasive sensation**.

---

Something's **pressing against your face.**  
Something warm, like a hand.  
Or two.  
Or maybe a **lap?**

Also-

&gt; *slap.*

Then-

&gt; *pinch.*

Then-**a hand shaking your collar.**

---

You mumble in the darkness:

&gt; &quot;Wh... why am I in a beanbag chair... made of disappointment...&quot;

Your mouth is dry.  
Your lips are forming syllables you don't quite understand.

&gt; &quot;Who keeps slapping me...?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Stop pinching me, I'll finish the worksheets...&quot;

---

Somewhere in your mind, an echo of **Vivi's voice**, distorted like a radio underwater:

&gt; &quot;...need you...&quot;

Then Tashigi's:

&gt; &quot;...kick your ass...&quot;

Another slap.

Definitely a **Marine slap.** You can tell by the discipline.

---

You float.

Your thoughts fragment into driftwood:

- **Snack Pack, in a graduation cap.**  
- **A chalkboard with &quot;JUST BREATHE&quot; scribbled on it.**  
- **A test. Multiple choice. The last question is &quot;Live or Die?&quot;**  
  - You've circled &quot;C) Nap.&quot;

---

Another slap.

Another **pinch**.

Something grabs your ear like a teacher scolding a teacher.

---

&gt; &quot;I'm... going to give you all zeroes if you don't stop touching me...&quot;

---

Your fingers twitch.

One, then two.

A flicker behind your eyes.

A *stirring*.

Not awake.

But *stirring.*

**OOC:**
You remain comatose-but **tactile stimulation is breaking through** the void.

Vivi and Tashigi's **physical contact** is piercing the mental fog.

You may now:

2. {Physically react-small twitch, breath, anything.}  
3. {Mentally begin to climb. Describe the dreamlike moment you reach upward.}

**Tone: Absurd Comfort | Mood: Blackout with Perks**

---

The void hums.

That strange *fuzzy buzz* of drifting consciousness, like the radio static between waking up and forgetting your own name.

Your entire body is aching, bruised, and barely functioning...

But your **head?**

Perfect.

Positively **cradled**.

Like the world's most luxurious pillow just **volunteered for a suicide mission**.

---

&gt; &quot;Mmm...&quot;

You shift slightly, your face **nuzzling into the warmth.**

It's not stone.

It's **not cobblestone.**

It's definitely not a kiwi.

No, it's...

Something **squishier**.

Pliable.

Soft in a way that whispers *you probably shouldn't ask questions.*

---

&gt; &quot;Mmm. Good pillow.&quot;

You mumble it like it's the final review of your afterlife accommodations.

You drool, just a little.

Maybe it's blood. Maybe it's kiwi. You're not even sure anymore.

---

**Outside, in the real world-**

**Vivi's face turns slowly red.**  
She's very aware now of where your head has landed-  
**squarely in her lap.**

**Tashigi's face contorts.**  
Conflicted between mortified amusement and *do I slap him again?*

---

You murmur again:

&gt; &quot;Don't suppose this is memory foam...&quot;

---

**Tashigi:** &quot;Unbelievable.&quot;  
**Vivi:** &quot;H-he's... lucid?!&quot;  
**Tashigi:** &quot;I think his *dignity* is dead. But yes.&quot;

---

Suddenly-

A *pulse*.

From the plaza.

From the **Elemental.**

It **glows again**.

It **twists-slowly**.

A hand raises.

Eyes open.

Faint, but **brightening.**

---

**Crocodile narrows his eyes.**

&gt; &quot;What now-?&quot;

---

And you?

You remain nestled like a baby in a fruit-scented coma.

You are the calm in the storm.

The **human hot water bottle** of war.

---

**OOC:**
You are half-awake.

Lucid, but still not functional.  
The **Elemental is stabilizing**.  
Luffy has noticed. Crocodile is about to act.

Would you like to:

1. {Mutter a warning. You're awake enough to speak.}  
2. {Attempt to stand. Very funny. Very sad.}  
3. {Let someone else take initiative-maybe the girls. Maybe the juice god.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âEnjoy the supposed memory foam. Exquisite.

The elemental remains still

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Most Exquisite Nap in a Warzone]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Delirious Majesty of Rest&quot;**  
**Tone: Surreal Comedy | Mood: Danger Be Damned, This Nap Slaps**

---

You don't move.  
You don't speak.  
You barely breathe.

But your head?

Cradled in the lap of a princess, in the middle of a revolution, under the heat of a desert sun and the gaze of gods and warlords?

**Exquisite.**

---

Your lips part, and the faintest whisper leaks out, content and blissfully stupid:

&gt; &quot;...This pillow is noble. Royal, even...&quot;

&gt; &quot;10/10. Would nap again.&quot;

---

**Vivi freezes.** Her eyes wide. Face crimson.

**Tashigi's jaw drops.**

&gt; &quot;Is he-*is he lucid or delusional??*&quot;

**Chopper** (somewhere nearby): &quot;Yes.&quot;

---

The world is cracking apart.  
**Luffy's fists are splitting air.**  
**Crocodile is about to unleash a sandstorm shaped like vengeance and hubris.**  
A literal **kiwi god** is idling above you like an uncertain security drone-

And you?

You are **wrapped in bliss**.

---

Above, the **Elemental** remains still.

It watches.

It feels your presence again.

But without direction, it hesitates.

It breathes.

Juice sloshes.

But it **does not move**.

---

**Crocodile sneers.**

&gt; &quot;Your pet's broken again.&quot;

His arm lifts, coiling with sand blades.

He takes aim-**not at Luffy-**

**At the plaza.**

---

**Tashigi looks up.**

Eyes wide.

&gt; &quot;Shit-he's targeting *us.*&quot;

---

**Vivi clutches you tighter.**

Not out of embarrassment.

Out of instinct.

&gt; &quot;Move. *Eatone, please move.*&quot;

---

**The Elemental pulses.**

And waits.

---

**OOC:**
You are dangerously close to a character death if Crocodile's next attack hits the plaza.  
The Elemental may react-but only with your awareness behind it.  
Your consciousness is *stable*, but deeply entrenched in blissful idiocy.

Would you like to:

1. {Force a whisper. A command. A plea. Something to rouse the Elemental.}  
2. {Twitch-just enough. Let instinct take over.}  
3. {Say something utterly wrong, but maybe emotionally true.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âContinue enjoying my well deserved nap. Maybe nestle in a bit.

OOC: they may attempt other actions to wake me up

The elemental remains still. It looks comfy, even. Somehow

**Scene: &quot;A Nap That Could End a Nation&quot;**  
**Tone: Comedic Tragedy | Mood: Cosmic-level Facepalm**

---

The battle rages above.  
Sand slices the sky.  
Luffy shouts through bloodied teeth.  
Crocodile raises his arm to deliver a blow **meant to erase you and anyone around you from existence.**

---

And you?

You sigh softly.

**Content.**

Your head snuggles deeper into what you're absolutely, unquestionably convinced is a goose-feather memory foam pillow stitched by angels.

&gt; &quot;Mmm... Warm... regal... lavender-scented...&quot;

You shift slightly.

One leg kicks out weakly in that **involuntary dreamt-of-stairs way.**

&gt; &quot;Mmm... ten more minutes...&quot;

---

**Vivi turns beet red.**  
Her entire posture stiffens.

**Tashigi's eye twitches.** She is rapidly approaching a tactical slap.

---

&gt; &quot;We're about to be vaporized, and he's *nuzzling my thigh like it's a holiday hammock!*&quot; Vivi hisses.

Tashigi exhales sharply, slapping her palm to her face.

&gt; &quot;I am going to court-martial him if we live.&quot;

---

**Meanwhile:**

The **Kiwi Elemental**, twenty feet tall and filled with Hero Water, observes you.  
Then, slowly...

It **sits.**

**Cross-legged.**

Like a **glowing green monk** waiting for its next command.  
A thin trickle of juice runs from its chin like drool.

It looks...

**Peaceful.**

Possibly also asleep.

---

**Crocodile's eyes gleam.**

His sand spear rises higher, *twisting*, ready to launch.

&gt; &quot;Say goodbye, princess.&quot;

---

**Tashigi throws Vivi back.**

**She stands between Crocodile's strike and your prone form.**

Sword shaking in her grip.  
Eyes burning.

&gt; &quot;You're not touching him. Not one damn grain of you.&quot;

---

**OOC:**

Your nap is now a tactical liability.  
Crocodile is seconds away from striking the entire plaza with a lethal sand storm.  
Tashigi is preparing to intercept with her body.  
The Elemental mirrors your rest state-unless forcibly roused.

Would you like them to:

1. {Slap. Very hard.}
2. {Use one of your own powers against you. Mist, juice-whatever works.}
3. {Say something deeply personal. Desperate. Risky.}
4. {Do all of the above.}

**Tone: Raw | Mood: The Final Plea**

---

You remain cradled in a lap you should not deserve, whispering half-dream nonsense into chaos incarnate.  

Above, the Elemental imitates your posture with tranquil serenity. A citrus monk in meditation. A god of inertia. A monument to nap-based problem solving.

Crocodile's spear sharpens into a whirlwind tip, coiled tight. He isn't aiming to wound anymore-**he's aiming to *erase***.

---

**Tashigi grips her sword-but it shakes.**

She knows her blade isn't fast enough to stop **a storm**.  
Her eyes dart to the sky, to the sand, then back to you.

---

&gt; &quot;Dammit...&quot;

She drops her blade and grabs you by the collar, shaking you now-not violently, but desperately.

She leans down, eyes blazing, forehead touching yours.

&gt; &quot;You told me I wasn't alone.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You told me kids shouldn't have to bleed for the mistakes of their elders.&quot;

Her voice breaks.

&gt; &quot;So *don't make us do it alone.*&quot;

---

She swallows.

&gt; &quot;You think I don't see what you are? You're not a coward. You're not a joke.&quot;

Her fingers tighten, trembling.

&gt; &quot;You're one of the bravest damn people I've ever met. You *choose* to stand between monsters and children.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And I'm not letting you die in my arms like some... *idiot martyr with a pillow kink!*&quot;

---

**Vivi**, eyes wide and glassy, stares down at you, lips trembling.

&gt; &quot;We're not just losing a fighter...&quot;

&gt; &quot;We're losing our *sensei.*&quot;

---

Above-

Crocodile's arm comes down.

---

&gt; &quot;*Goodbye.*&quot;

---

**OOC:**

You've now been reached with:

- **Personal confessions of belief.**  
- **Emotional vulnerability.**  
- **A call to your identity.**  
- **A surprisingly accurate accusation of unconscious thigh-napping.**

Your next heartbeat may determine whether **Alubarna survives this moment.**

Would you like to:

1. {Whisper. Stir. Call. Something.}  
2. {Let the Elemental respond on its own.}  
3. {Stay still. Leave it to fate.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Frown as I'm shaken, lamenting the loss of my deluxe pillow.

Ugh... Are you rain dinners staff? Could you bring another pillow 

My eyes creak open, then see Tashigi's flustered, desperate face as she shakes me like a maraca, and then at the growing sand projectile forming in the sky.

Wuhh... Oh SHIT.

OOC: What are their reactions?

&gt; *&quot;Ugh... Are you Rain Dinners staff? Could you bring another pillow-&quot;*

That's the first thing out of your mouth.

Half-mumbled.

Completely nonsense.

Tashigi and Vivi freeze.

---

**Tashigi's eyes snap wide open.**  
Her mouth moves in silent disbelief.  
The first instinct is to slap you again, but her hand stops halfway.

&gt; &quot;You *idiot,* you're-?!&quot;

Then you *really* look around.

You register her flushed, furious, tear-lined face.

You see Vivi clinging to your arm like a lifeline.

You see the **massive sand spear** descending from the sky like **God's own guillotine**.

And then-

&gt; &quot;Wuhh... Oh SHIT.&quot;

---

**Tashigi just screams:**

&gt; &quot;*WELCOME BACK!!*&quot;

---

**Vivi gasps-then laughs. It bursts out of her like a gasp of air after drowning.**

&gt; &quot;He's *awake!*&quot;

She doesn't cry.

Not quite.

But she's suddenly wiping her eyes like it's the sand.

---

All around, people **hear you**-your voice carrying up with the wind.

**Luffy's head jerks around.**

**Crocodile's spear hesitates.**

He sees **your eyes open**, that **juice-god still standing**, and he snarls:

&gt; &quot;*No.*&quot;

---

**The Elemental-**

The very instant your eyes open-**twitches.**

Once.

Then **rumbles**.

It *moves.*

**Shoulders rising.**

Eyes glowing.

Hands curling into fists.

---

The nap is over.

---

**OOC:**

- Your consciousness has **fully returned**-your connection to the Kiwi Elemental restored.
- Crocodile's attack is **moments** from launching.
- Tashigi and Vivi are overwhelmed-**relief, anger, disbelief, joy** in equal measure.

Would you like to:

1. {Command the Elemental to intercept the sand spear.}
2. {Unleash the Elemental's full remaining energy. All in.}
3. {Combine a last fruit technique from yourself to power it. Dual strike.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Have the elemental crash tackle the spear, turn it into muddy, useless mush.

Also my back falls limps as Tashigi briefly lets me go, and I conveniently fall back into... Pillows.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Divine Divebomb]**  
**Scene: &quot;No Sand Shall Pass&quot;**  
**Tone: Triumphant | Mood: Heroic and... Extremely Awkward**

---

The moment the sand spear finishes its arc-gleaming, swirling, massive-

**your eyes snap wide.**

You raise a single, trembling arm-

&gt; &quot;*Intercept it-NOW!!*&quot;

---

And the **Kiwi Elemental responds.**

Not with delay.

Not with hesitation.

With **explosive momentum**.

---

It launches **upward** like a cannonball of citrus vengeance, arms outstretched like a linebacker made of juice and willpower.

It doesn't try to dodge. Doesn't swing wide.

It **tackles** the spear.

**Head-on.**

---

&gt; *SHHHHHHHHRRKRKRRSHHHH-!!*

Sand meets juice.

Dry meets wet.

And the result?

**Mud.**

Sopping, steaming **mud**, splashes down over the plaza in sloppy, defeated globs. The once-lethal projectile is **instantly neutralized**, turned into chunky, embarrassing failure.

---

**Crocodile recoils.**  
His arm jerks back.  
His mouth curls-not in rage.

In **pure disbelief.**

&gt; &quot;What...? *WHAT?*&quot;

---

The Elemental crashes to earth in a dramatic, three-point landing, steam rising from its soaked form.

It growls once.

Raises both arms.

And **flexes.**

---

**Back below...**

&gt; *FLOP.*

Tashigi, finally relaxing her death grip on you, releases you-

And your body **falls backwards** like a lazy noodle.

Your head **once again lands directly in Vivi's lap.**

---

&gt; &quot;Mmm. Deluxe...&quot;

---

**Vivi makes a noise between a gasp and a yelp.**

&gt; &quot;*Wh-again?!*&quot;

---

**Tashigi's mouth falls open.**

&gt; &quot;You've *got* to be kidding me.&quot;

---

**Luffy's jaw drops.**

He points.

&gt; &quot;He really *doesn't stop* touching her lap, huh?&quot;

---

**Sanji turns purple.**

**Zoro wheezes.**

---

But then...

The skies clear slightly.

The spear is gone.

The **Elemental stands victorious**.

Crocodile is **staggered**, caught off-guard for the first time.

---

**OOC:**
- Crocodile's attack has been **neutralized.**
- Your Elemental remains active-sluggish but powerful.
- You've officially reclaimed the **Throne of Napdom.**
- Vivi is now questioning everything about life.

Would you like to:

1. {Issue another command-go on the offensive.}
2. {Say something very stupid to Vivi or Tashigi.}
3. {Rest. Briefly. Before the final phase.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I... For the record, whatever I said or did while I was knocked out was not my fault.

You sigh-deeply, longingly-as your head **sinks once again into what has become the most cursed throne in Alabasta.**  
The **plush lap** of a diplomatic heir.  
Silky. Warm. Slightly judgmental.

---

With eyes barely half-lidded and expression pained only by residual mortal wounds, you murmur:

&gt; &quot;I... for the record...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Whatever I said. Or did. While I was knocked out...&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;...was not my fault.&quot;

You squirm an inch deeper into the lap like it's a fruit-shaped mattress and you're checking for firmness ratings.

---

**Vivi** makes a **tiny noise** of sheer flustered indignation. Her face ignites, so red it's like she's secretly a Logia of embarrassment.

&gt; &quot;Y-you-*why are you always landing here?!*&quot;

She tries to shift you off, but your limbs dangle like overcooked noodles.

&gt; &quot;I can't even tell if this is an accident or a strategy anymore!&quot;

---

**Tashigi** lets out a sound that is part snort, part scream, part deep-seated exasperation.

&gt; &quot;I'm filing a report on this.&quot;

&gt; &quot;A *long* report.&quot;

&gt; &quot;With attachments.&quot;

---

Up on the rooftop-

**Crocodile** is still stunned, his hand shaking slightly from the shock of losing his sand spear to an oversized juice blob.

**Luffy**, fists clenched, **grins wide**.

&gt; &quot;You got backup now, Croco-man!&quot;

&gt; &quot;And he's powered by *nap time!!*&quot;

---

The **Kiwi Elemental** stomps forward, slowly but deliberately.

It glances down at you.

Then back to Crocodile.

It raises both arms.

**Juice begins to swirl.**

---

**OOC:**
- You've stabilized.
- The battle momentum has shifted.
- The Elemental is re-energizing.
- Crocodile is rattled.
- You... remain deeply embedded in Vivi's personal space.

Would you like to:

1. {Command the Elemental to assist Luffy.}
2. {Say something to Vivi-sweet, dumb, or both.}
3. {Actually try to sit up. You maniac.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 / 2 / 3 - Have the elemental continue engaging Crocodile.

Attempt to get out of Vivi's lap like a responsible adult, but my muscles aren't working.

I am so, so sorry about this.

You groan.  
It's the groan of a man who has made **some choices**.  
Some of them **heroic**, others... deeply questionable.

You wiggle your fingers, then your toes.  
Your arms still feel like **wet towels** soaked in trauma and citrus.  
Your spine? It's lobbying to declare independence.

But your **will**?

&gt; *Firm.*  
&gt; *Professional.*  
&gt; *Desperately trying to get out of a royal lap.*

---

&gt; &quot;I am... so... so sorry about this...&quot;

You start to push yourself up.

Your elbows tremble.

Your back does a strange **pop-crunch-twang** noise.

You rise exactly **three inches**-

&gt; *fwump*

And land **right back** where you started.

Face first.

Lap deep.

---

**Vivi's face is a national emergency.**

&gt; &quot;Wh-Why?! Are you cursed?! Did your Devil Fruit do this?!&quot;

---

**Tashigi's face is unreadable.**  
Like a woman trying to hold in either a lecture or a scream. Possibly both.

---

&gt; &quot;M'just... legs aren't legging,&quot; you mutter.

&gt; &quot;I'll... move soon. I promise.&quot;

---

But even as your dignity remains in critical condition, your **mind** is sharp enough to do what matters most:

You lift your right hand.

Point it toward the rooftop.

&gt; &quot;Kiwi-kun... go help the rubber idiot.&quot;

---

The **Kiwi Elemental** pulses.

It straightens.

And with a mighty roar like a thousand angry juice boxes being opened at once, it **charges**.

---

**Crocodile turns, too late.**

He raises a wall of sand-  
The Elemental punches through.

Luffy lunges from the flank-  
Crocodile reels, **boxed in.**

---

For the first time, the Warlord of the Sands is being **pressed.**

Not just by power-

But by teamwork.

By chaos.

By juice.

---

**OOC:**
- The Elemental has re-entered battle at full aggression, now coordinated with Luffy.
- Crocodile is officially off-balance and under pressure.
- You remain in Vivi's lap, attempting dignity, but mostly apologizing.
- The tide of the battle has shifted in favor of the Straw Hat alliance.

Would you like to:

1. {Attempt another escape from Lapland. Risky.}
2. {Say something dumb but heartfelt to Vivi or Tashigi.}
3. {Mentally link deeper to the Elemental-guide its strikes.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - As to not make everything I've said about being a responsible adult sound hollow, could one of you... Help me off?

You squint at the sky, your vision framed by billowing sand, clashing giants, and the faint mist of citrus vengeance. Your body is *done*. Your nerves are burnt toast with a side of secondhand embarrassment.

But your voice?

**Still composed.**  
Still trying to hold the line of maturity.

---

&gt; &quot;As to not make everything I've said about being a responsible adult sound hollow...&quot;

You gulp. Your cheek's still pressed to something soft and increasingly awkward.

&gt; &quot;Could one of you... *help me off?*&quot;

---

**Vivi stares down at you**, eyes still flushed with adrenaline, embarrassment, and something softer-**something like relief**.

&gt; &quot;Y-you want help?&quot;

She clears her throat. Tries to act composed.

&gt; &quot;After all that...?&quot;

&gt; &quot;The sleeping... The mumbling... The *nuzzling??*&quot;

---

**Tashigi, arms crossed nearby, deadpans:**

&gt; &quot;Oh, now *he* wants to get up.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Should we call a *crane*?&quot;

---

You give the smallest, weakest little shrug known to man.

&gt; &quot;I'm just... *very injured.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;And clearly no longer a threat to laps.&quot;

---

Vivi exhales slowly, then leans forward and-very gently-slips her arms beneath yours, careful of your bruises.

&gt; &quot;Alright, Sensei. Come on. Let's reclaim what's left of your dignity.&quot;

She hauls you upright with **considerable effort**, your knees buckling the moment you try to stand.

**Tashigi grabs the other side**, and between them, you're now **dangling like a very tired backpack between two furious schoolgirls.**

---

**Vivi mutters:**  
&gt; &quot;This is somehow *more awkward* than the lap.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- You're now upright-but barely, with Vivi and Tashigi supporting you on either side.
- Crocodile is being actively pressured by Luffy and the Elemental.
- The tide of battle is swinging rapidly.

Would you like to:

1. {Encourage the girls. You've got this teacher energy, after all.}
2. {Try to guide the Elemental mid-fight. Tactically or emotionally.}
3. {Offer a war-cry. Possibly citrus-themed.}

You hang there between Vivi and Tashigi, arms draped over their shoulders like some half-cooked piÃ±ata of man and regret, your legs making the occasional attempt at autonomy before crumpling under the weight of heroism and excessive blood loss.

You're upright. Technically.

Your dignity?  
Still in recovery.

---

You clear your throat-weakly. Heroically. **Defensively.**

&gt; &quot;I told you. *Involuntary.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'm a good person. I swear.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I teach *civics,* for God's sake...&quot;

---

**Vivi doesn't look at you.**  
Just keeps you steady with a slight flush in her cheeks and the faintest twitch in her lips. The kind that says she might forgive you. One day.

**Tashigi snorts.**

&gt; &quot;Yeah, well... we'll be adding a *new* chapter to your reputation.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Chapter One: How Not to Wake Up in Front of Royalty.&quot;

---

You nod solemnly, then immediately wince because it pulls at your bruised shoulder.

&gt; &quot;Fair.&quot;

---

You lift your head.

**The battle is raging above-**

The **Kiwi Elemental** is now in full brawl with Crocodile:

- **Every punch** it throws **splatters** pressurized juice into the sandstorm, bogging down Crocodile's movements.
- **Every dodge** Luffy makes redirects Crocodile into a new position-trapped between **rubber and ragefruit**.
- The elemental now seems **smarter**-learning, reacting, pulsing in sync with your gaze.
- And Crocodile? He's **no longer smirking.**

---

He's surrounded. Pinned.

His sand is starting to **clump**.  
His **cloak is stained.**  
His movements-sharper. Angrier. But **predictable.**

The Elemental's timing has gotten better.

Luffy's getting closer.

---

The **endgame is near.**

And they're winning.

Because of **you**.

---

**OOC:**
You are now alert and back in control of your fruit.  
The battle is swinging hard in your favor.  
Crocodile is now pressed-no longer confident. You are moments from victory.

Would you like to:

1. {Issue a final command to the Elemental-one coordinated finishing blow.}  
2. {Let Luffy have it. Support from the sidelines.}  
3. {Say something dumb again. It's tradition now.}

You suddenly gasp.

Eyes wide.

Soul cold.

&gt; &quot;WAIT-!&quot;

Both Vivi and Tashigi jump.

&gt; &quot;*What?!*&quot; they cry in unison, half-expecting another attack.

---

You wrench your neck toward them.

Panic in your eyes.

&gt; &quot;**What time is it?!**&quot;

---

The plaza freezes for a half-second-not from Crocodile, not from destiny-

But from **you**.

---

**Vivi stammers:**  
&gt; &quot;I-I don't know-past noon?? Why?!&quot;

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; &quot;Eatone. What the hell does it matter?! We're in the middle of-&quot;

But it matters.

**Oh god. It matters.**

You feel it.

The **forgotten doom** creeping in.

You jerk your head toward the sky, toward the sun, toward the slowly calming sandstorm... then to your own hands.

A single thought slams into your skull:

&gt; &quot;How long was I out?!&quot;

**Tashigi stiffens.**

&gt; The time from your unconscious collapse post-elemental summoning, to your reawakening and re-command was approximately...  
**3 minutes, 38 seconds.**

---

You still have time.

But **barely**.

Something is about to happen.

Your voice is sharp. Tight. Calculating something that no one else understands just yet.

---

**Window is open.**  
Please respond.

&gt;&gt; USER: âThat's.. almost 5 minutes... And if my hypothesis is correct...

Kiwi-kun! Stop fighting 

OOC: give me a window to respond 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Five-Minute Rule]**  
**Scene: &quot;Expiration Date&quot;**  
**Tone: Rising Panic | Mood: Suspicion, Control, Crisis Incoming**  

---

The battle screeches.

Not in sound.

In **motion**.

As you **shout with sudden urgency**:

&gt; &quot;**Kiwi-kun! STOP FIGHTING!!**&quot;

The Elemental-mid-swing, arm cocked back to deliver what might've been a *decisive* citrus-charged punch to Crocodile's spine-

**Freezes.**

Juice dripping.  
Glow pulsing.  
Its entire body suddenly **still**, like a beast caught mid-breath.

---

Luffy's arm is drawn back too, confused by the hesitation.

&gt; &quot;Oi! Juice guy! What're you doing?!&quot;

---

**Crocodile stumbles back**, winded, blinking in disbelief.

&gt; &quot;What... you're giving up?!&quot;

---

**Vivi looks at you, horror dawning.**

**Tashigi narrows her eyes.**

&gt; &quot;...Almost five minutes...?&quot;

She gets it.

Or at least she's starting to.

---

**The Elemental stands still.**  
**Steam begins to rise** from its back-soft at first, then stronger.

Its shape begins to **wobble**.

---

**Hero Water.**

The whispered miracle.

The myth.

The **deadly trade-off.**

---

**OOC:**  
You now have the floor.  
All eyes on you.

**What is your hypothesis?**

&gt;&gt; USER: âFocus on growing! Grow like all of kiwi kind depends on it!

(It starts accumulating mass)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Final Bloom]**  
**Scene: &quot;Five Minutes to Bloom&quot;**  
**Tone: Dire Majesty | Mood: Life at the Edge of Collapse**

---

Your voice rings out-torn between **hope** and **hysteria**.

You're no longer commanding with force.

You're **pleading**.

You're reaching out to your creation, your **child of pulp and desperation**, born from love for students, for justice, for every damn kid who shouldn't have to bleed in a war they didn't start.

---

&gt; &quot;Focus on **growing**!  
&gt; Grow like all of kiwi kind depends on it!&quot;

---

And for a heartbeat-**nothing.**

---

Then...

The **Elemental trembles.**

Its mass begins to **shift**, not outward-but upward.  
**Pulsing. Expanding. Swelling.**

It no longer moves like a fighter.

It **bends backward**, arms stretched skyward, body rippling, juice veins glowing **hot white-green**.

The **Hero Water**, reaching the **end of its five-minute life**, now burns like a star at its limit.

---

It **grows.**

**Taller. Broader. Deeper.**

The shape becomes less humanoid-more primal.  
A **monolith of liquid power** on the verge of **something greater**.

---

**Crocodile staggers back, shielding his eyes.**

&gt; &quot;What... *what is that thing doing?!*&quot;

---

**Luffy steps back too, watching.**  
His jaw slack, his instincts catching on:

&gt; &quot;It's not gonna fight...  
&gt; It's gonna do something *else.*&quot;

---

**Vivi's hand finds yours.**

**Tashigi grabs your arm.**

You're trembling.

But not with fear.

With **faith.**

---

**OOC:**
- The Kiwi Elemental is now **entering its final form**, catalyzed by the Hero Water's terminal moment.
- It has ceased combat.
- It is **gathering mass**, preparing for a final act-one born not from combat instinct, but **growth.**

Would you like to:

1. {Let it complete its transformation naturally. No interference.}  
2. {Guide its growth. Infuse it with your intent.}  
3. {Call out one last emotional command-make its final act a legacy.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âAt its zenith, right at the 5 minute mark, the kiwi elemental dies. Violently.

But more importantly, explosively.

Tens of thousands of gallons of Kiwi juice explode in a fantastical burst, coating every surface, every coat, every grain of sand completely through with juice.

And Crocodile? Is soaked. To the bone. No sand on him, or around him in a 5 mile radius remains untouched by the hand of citrus justice 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - The Final Lesson]**  
**Scene: &quot;Extra Pulp, No Mercy&quot;**  
**Tone: Climactic | Mood: Catastrophic Victory**

---

The **Kiwi Elemental swells** to monstrous proportions-  
a glowing, mountainous titan of shimmering green and citrus gold.  
The heat from the **Hero Water core** surges to critical mass.  
It lets out one final, mournful roar-  
not of pain, but of **purpose.**

---

Everyone-**everyone**-stops.

Rebels.

Soldiers.

Civilians.

Straw Hats.

Even Crocodile.

---

The sun glints off its shining skin.

And then-

&gt; *5:00.*

---

&gt; *FWOOOOOOOMMMM-*

---

The sky tears open with a **howl of juice**,  
as the **Elemental explodes** in a deafening, glorious **detonation of flavor**.

---

A shockwave of **blistering kiwi juice** crashes outward in **every direction**,  
a tsunami of emerald rain and acid-sweet mist-

---

- **The palace walls? Drenched.**  
- **The sand dunes? Flooded.**  
- **The war-torn streets of Alubarna? Transformed into a tropical lagoon.**

---

And **Crocodile?**

Oh, Crocodile.

You see him as the shockwave **reaches him first.**

The **sand barrier he tries to raise?**  
Liquified.  
Washed away.  
Utterly erased.

---

The second it hits-

&gt; *SPLAAAAASHHHHHHH!!!*

---

**His coat soaks instantly**, weighed down by gallons of pulp and pulp-adjacent rage.  
His hair clings to his skull.  
His hook is **coated**.  
His cigar?  
Extinguished.  
His **soul?**  
Humiliated.

---

His power?

**Nullified.**

Not an ounce of sand left within **a five-mile radius** responds to his will.

He's standing alone.

**Soaked.**

**Fuming.**

**Defenseless.**

---

Luffy lands in front of him.

No words.

Just a grin.

One wet, citrus-slicked fist clenched.

---

&gt; &quot;*Gomu Gomu no...*&quot;

---

**OOC:**
The elemental's detonation has removed all sand from the battlefield.  
**Crocodile is powerless.**  
**Luffy now has a clean, lethal opening.**  
The fight is over.

Would you like to:

1. {Say something stupidly triumphant from your juice-drenched throne.}  
2. {Witness the finale with pride. And probably a sneeze.}  
3. {Pass out again. With dignity this time.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - Mmm. Pillows would be nice. Flop limply in Vivi and Tashigi's arms

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Last Drip]**  
**Scene: &quot;This Teacher Has Logged Off&quot;**  
**Tone: Triumphant | Mood: Sweet, Soaked Sleep**

---

You watch as the **juice tsunami clears**, the battlefield now gleaming in emerald haze.  
Crocodile stands stunned, wet, defeated, and without a single grain of sand to save him.

Luffy grins.  
His fist rises.  
Victory is in the air.

---

You blink once.

Twice.

Your legs are done.  
Your nerves? Vapor.  
Your body's clock?

&gt; &quot;*Yeah, no. We're done here.*&quot;

---

You glance at **Vivi**, whose face is equal parts amazement and exhaustion.

You lean a little.

Then a little more.

Until-**flop.**

---

You go **limp** in both **her arms** and **Tashigi's**, the ultimate final act of a teacher who gave **absolutely everything** he had.

---

&gt; &quot;Mmm. Pillows would be nice...&quot;

And then you're out.

---

**Tashigi sighs-heavily.**  
But there's a smile in it.

&gt; &quot;At least he waited âtil the job was done.&quot;

---

**Vivi brushes juice-soaked hair from your face.**

&gt; &quot;...Thank you, Sensei.&quot;

---

Above-

&gt; &quot;Gomu Gomu no...&quot;

---

**BOOM.**

Crocodile goes flying.

Justice-and juice-prevails.

---

**[END SCENE.]**

**OOC:**
You are unconscious.  
You have **fulfilled your role.**  
You have **saved the kingdom.**  
And you did it all with **pulp, pride, and a pretty sweet pillow arc.**

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {Post-battle epilogue-waking in safety.}  
2. {Immediate aftermath from another character's POV.}  
3. {Fade to black. End of arc.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Vivi and Tashigi, now soaked in kiwi juice (like everyone else in the city), are holding on to a now limp and useless individual

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - Aftermath of the Citrus Apocalypse]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Kingdom, the Sword, and the Napper&quot;**  
**POV: Vivi &amp; Tashigi**  
**Tone: Exhausted Victory | Mood: Muddled Relief and Sticky Sentiment**

---

The plaza is quiet.

Not silent-there's the drip-drip of **juice cascading off rooftops**,  
the occasional cough of a soaked rebel or soldier trying to get **kiwi out of their ears**,  
the bubbling **gurgle of newly-formed juice puddles** the size of fishing boats-

But for a battlefield, this is peace.

---

**Crocodile** is unconscious, buried halfway in the palace wall,  
**Luffy** stands above him, panting, bruised, and gloriously smug.  
The **Straw Hats** are regrouping.

---

And in the center of the plaza, still framed by a crater of pure tropical ruin-

Stand **Vivi** and **Tashigi**.

Sopping.  
Drenched.  
Sticky in ways that will haunt them.

---

Between them, dangling like a **deflated festival float**, is **Eatone Cheng**-  
schoolteacher, bounty hunter, juice-based walking disaster.

---

**Tashigi** has both hands under one of your arms, glaring down at your unconscious form like it owes her money and an apology.

&gt; &quot;I swear, if he drools on me again, I'm leaving him in a puddle.&quot;

---

**Vivi**, on your other side, is gentler. Still wide-eyed, still shaken-but her grip is strong.

&gt; &quot;He saved the kingdom.&quot;

She says it softly, like she doesn't quite believe it even now.

---

Tashigi clicks her tongue.

&gt; &quot;Yeah. Right after violating every protocol in the Marine handbook, nearly dying three times, and turning Alubarna into a juice bar.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;...but yeah. He did.&quot;

---

Vivi looks down at you.

&gt; &quot;He was trying to leave, you know. Just a wrong vacationer in the right place.&quot;

She smiles-soft. Thoughtful.

&gt; &quot;I don't think he knows he became a hero.&quot;

---

Tashigi snorts.

&gt; &quot;He'll realize it when I file a report and write his name in *all caps.*&quot;

---

They share a tired glance.

One moment of mutual understanding between **the marine** and **the princess**.

Then they both **hoist your limp body again**, your boots dragging lightly in the puddle you created.

---

&gt; **Tashigi:** &quot;Come on, teacher. Let's get you somewhere dry before the ants find you.&quot;  
&gt; **Vivi:** &quot;And maybe somewhere with pillows that *aren't me.*&quot;

---

They walk on.

Together.

---

**OOC:**
- Alabarna is saved.
- Crocodile is defeated.
- The story continues-but your part in this battle is over.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {The Straw Hats saying farewell.}  
2. {Waking up, again, elsewhere-with bandages and recognition.}  
3. {A time skip epilogue, back home.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Smoker notices his subordinate dragging some unknown man around with the princess of Alabasta (he doesn't know the source of the kiwi elemental, or how it was summoned)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Plaza - The Unseen Watcher Returns]**  
**Scene: &quot;Cigars and Suspicion&quot;**  
**POV: Smoker**  
**Tone: Low-Burning Tension | Mood: Shrewd Observation with a Hint of Concern**

---

The battlefield has quieted.  
Smoke-both literal and metaphorical-rises into the desert air.  
The scent of **pulverized sand, ozone, and inexplicably kiwi** lingers over the shattered capital.

---

From a rooftop on the far side of the plaza, a **figure materializes out of mist and fury**,  
his **Marine coat draped over his shoulders**,  
his **cigar half-lit**, jaw clenched, boots dragging slightly from **fresh, half-healed wounds**.

He's been through hell.

A **locked cage**, miles of **burned corridors**, half a city of chaos.

And now?

He sees her.

---

**Tashigi.**  
Covered in pulp.  
Dragging some limp civilian with Vivi Nefertari like it's an everyday field trip.  
Her sword is broken. Her posture wrecked.  
And her expression?

Not defeated.

Just... **exhausted.** But proud.

---

Smoker narrows his eyes.

&gt; &quot;The hell did I miss.&quot;

---

He steps forward on the rooftop, steam swirling around him.

He sees the **wreckage of Crocodile** smashed into the palace.

The **Straw Hat crew** regrouping, several of them laughing as they try to peel sticky juice off their clothes.

He sees **no sand**.

Not a single trace.

---

But most importantly-

He sees the **mystery man.**

The one being lugged around like a wet carpet.

Civilian?  
Agent?  
Marine?

He's wearing a **schoolteacher's coat**.  
His face is **bruised**.  
His body is **half-pulped**.  
But there's **something about him.**

---

&gt; &quot;Who the hell is that guy?&quot;

---

He watches the trio vanish down a side street.  
Tashigi hasn't seen him yet.

But she's **smiling.**

The princess is smiling too.

And that man-**that goddamn kiwi-scented civilian-**  
he just **shifted slightly in his sleep** and murmured something about **&quot;homework due dates.&quot;**

---

Smoker sighs, biting down on his cigar.

&gt; &quot;...I really hope that idiot's not a Devil Fruit user.&quot;

He exhales.

&gt; &quot;Because I think he just made himself the *most unpredictable variable in Alabasta.*&quot;

---

He vanishes in smoke.

Watching. Waiting.

Knowing this file isn't closed.

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker has returned and now has **eyes on your character**.
- He does not yet know the full extent of your involvement.
- You may become **a person of interest** in his report to the Marines.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You waking up with Smoker nearby, quietly watching.}  
2. {Straw Hats' farewell and Vivi's choice.}  
3. {A secret debrief between Tashigi and Smoker.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Smoker goes to Tashigic. Did she pick him up at a bar in the middle of battle?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Backstreets - Citrus Debrief]**  
**Scene: &quot;Bar Pickup or Battlefield Hero?&quot;**  
**POV: Smoker**  
**Tone: Dry | Mood: Deadpan Tension Meets Emotional Fallout**

---

A coil of **smoke snakes into the alley**, cutting through the lingering mist of evaporating kiwi like a sharpened sigh.

**Tashigi stiffens.**

**Vivi freezes.**

And the third member of their sticky trio-you-gives a tiny snore and nuzzles deeper into Vivi's side, now firmly wrapped in a blanket of bandages and dried pulp.

---

Smoker appears in full a moment later, stepping from vapor like a judge entering a ruined courtroom.

He doesn't say anything at first.

Just **stares**.

At the broken streets.

At the still-smoking crater where a Warlord fell.

At the **utterly drenched, beat-to-hell, juice-scented mess** of a man his subordinate is dragging through the city like she lost a drinking bet.

He takes one long, smoldering puff from his cigar.

---

&gt; &quot;Tashigi.&quot;

His tone is flat as the desert floor.

&gt; &quot;Did you pick this guy up at a **bar** in the middle of a battlefield, or...?&quot;

---

**Tashigi doesn't even flinch.**

She gives him a glare that could slice a cannonball.

&gt; &quot;No, sir.&quot;

She adjusts her grip on your shoulder, then nods toward the plaza behind them.

&gt; &quot;I picked him up after he *summoned a juice elemental,* tanked two assassination attempts, dragged himself into the center of Crocodile's trap, saved Princess Vivi twice, **and** turned the desert into a salad dressing.&quot;

---

**Smoker stares.**

One puff.

Two.

Then:

&gt; &quot;...So bar, then.&quot;

---

**Vivi bursts out laughing.**  
It's that kind of breathless, drained, post-near-death-laugh that's more tears than joy.

&gt; &quot;He said he was just here on vacation...&quot;

She wipes her eyes, still smiling.

&gt; &quot;He was supposed to be a schoolteacher. I think he *still is.*&quot;

---

Smoker squints at you again, unconvinced.

&gt; &quot;He's drooling on royalty.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;It's involuntary,&quot; Tashigi mutters through gritted teeth.

---

Smoker sighs, shaking his head.

He looks at Tashigi.

Then at Vivi.

Then back to you.

&gt; &quot;Alright. I want a full report.&quot;

&gt; &quot;In writing. With charts.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And you-&quot;  
He jabs a thumb at your unconscious, vaguely muttering form.  
&gt; &quot;When he wakes up, make sure he understands this whole âsaving a kingdom by accident' thing? That's not standard operating procedure.&quot;

---

He flicks the ash off his cigar and turns to walk away, his coat billowing behind him.

&gt; &quot;Oh. And if he's got a bounty now, I'm not paying for it.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker now understands your impact-though refuses to emotionally process it.  
- You are **not in trouble... yet.**  
- Tashigi has **defended your honor** (and very questionable judgment).  
- Vivi is **still laughing.**

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You waking up, again. Somewhere safe.}  
2. {Straw Hats preparing to leave-Vivi's farewell.}  
3. {Time skip-your return home.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - The Straw hat crew goes to secure Cobra. Luffy heads into the palace to check out the pone-somethings. Wasn't there another baroque agent involved?

**Scene: &quot;The Final Threads of Baroque Works&quot;**  
**POV: Straw Hat Crew**  
**Tone: Post-Battle | Mood: Suspicion, Curiosity, Unease**

---

The sun is lower now.

The war is over.

But the dust hasn't settled-**not completely.**

---

**The Straw Hats**, dirty, sticky, and half-limping, begin spreading out through the palace ruins.

**Zoro and Sanji** head toward the inner halls, weapons ready, checking for any lingering agents.  
**Nami** mutters under her breath about her shoes being ruined.  
**Usopp** is carrying a partially conscious Chopper like he's a wounded soldier in a dramatic opera.

And **Luffy**-bandaged, grinning, and coated in drying kiwi-looks up at the towering palace with wide, curious eyes.

---

&gt; &quot;So where's that pone... pone-something?&quot;

---

**Vivi**, having ensured the city is safe and her father is being tended to, catches up to the crew near the central doors.

&gt; &quot;Poneglyph.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And yes... Crocodile was after it. It's hidden beneath the palace.&quot;

---

**Robin.**

She flashes in Vivi's memory like a shadow.

The last **Baroque Works officer** who hadn't fallen.

The one who didn't fight.

The one who **translated ancient texts** with her fingers and her eyes.

---

Vivi turns sharply.

&gt; &quot;There was... one more.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Miss All Sunday.&quot;

&gt; &quot;She's still out there.&quot;

---

Luffy cracks his knuckles, walking up the broken palace steps.

&gt; &quot;Guess I'll go ask the rock.&quot;

---

---

**OOC:**

- The Straw Hats are now **searching the palace**, looking to secure **Cobra** and discover **the Poneglyph**.
- **Nico Robin** has not been accounted for-she is the **last major Baroque Works officer unaccounted for**.
- Luffy is about to walk directly into **one of the most important lore events** in the world... while still kinda sticky.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene shift to Luffy entering the chamber with the Poneglyph.}  
2. {Follow the crew as they locate Cobra.}  
3. {Return to Eatone's POV, post-nap.}

**Scene: &quot;The Stone That Holds the Truth&quot;**  
**POV: Narrative Summary**  
**Tone: Lore-Heavy | Mood: Quiet, Ominous, Crucial**

---

As the chaos above settles and the kingdom exhales in pulp-scented peace, **Luffy**, still bleeding, bruised, and utterly unbothered, descends into the secret chamber beneath the palace.

Guided by instinct, residual directions, and the smell of something *weird and old*, he arrives at the **Poneglyph Room**.

---

There, in the darkness-

Stands a **massive stone monolith**, carved with a language lost to time.

A **Poneglyph.**

---

**Nico Robin**-Miss All Sunday-stands before it.

Her back to him.

Hands clasped. Calm.

She does not raise a weapon.

She does not run.

---

When **Luffy enters**, she turns slowly.

No hostility.

Just... curiosity.

---

&gt; &quot;You're not supposed to be down here.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But I suppose you'll go wherever you like.&quot;

---

Luffy stares at the stone, then back at her.

&gt; &quot;What's it say?&quot;

---

She smiles.

Not like Crocodile.

Not like a villain.

Something more... personal.

---

&gt; &quot;It speaks of Pluton.&quot;

&gt; &quot;An ancient weapon capable of erasing islands.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Crocodile wanted it to conquer the world.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But this stone... doesn't tell him where to find it.&quot;

---

Luffy tilts his head.

&gt; &quot;Do *you* know?&quot;

---

Robin looks at him.

A long moment.

Then:

&gt; &quot;No.&quot;

---

And that is, perhaps, the first real truth spoken in this room in centuries.

---

As Marines close in.

As Cobra is rescued.

As Alabasta begins to rise from its knees-

Robin looks to Luffy...

And something in her eyes says she's **already chosen her next path**.

---

**OOC Summary:**

- The Poneglyph beneath Alubarna **does not contain the location of Pluton**, only knowledge *about* it.
- Nico Robin, a Baroque agent until now, has **betrayed Crocodile's expectations** by keeping the truth.
- Luffy and Robin share a moment of quiet understanding.
- Her future is about to take a sharp turn.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene shift to Eatone waking up post-battle.}  
2. {Scene shift to Cobra and Vivi reunited.}  
3. {Follow Robin's quiet exit from the ruins.}

**Scene: &quot;The Woman Who Read Too Much&quot;**  
**POV: Nico Robin**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Shadowed Transition**

---

The cool stone of the **Poneglyph chamber** hums in silence.

The footsteps of **Monkey D. Luffy** fade above her, replaced by the rumble of voices, boots, and celebration returning to the palace.

Victory.

For the kingdom.

For the rebels.

For the children.

Not for her.

---

**Nico Robin** remains in the room just a moment longer, her fingers tracing the ancient carvings.

She's memorized every symbol.

Every line.

Even the ones she pretended not to read aloud for **Crocodile**.

---

&gt; &quot;He never cared what it said.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Only what it could get him.&quot;

---

She brushes juice pulp from her shoulder absently.

The scent of kiwi lingers in the air like a final mockery of the Warlord's failed legacy.

She smiles faintly.

---

&gt; &quot;I liked the teacher better.&quot;

---

She turns.

Ascends the broken stairwell with the grace of a cat, even with stone crumbling beneath her heels.

The guards are too busy.

The Marines aren't watching for **her**-not yet.

---

She passes by the **rubble** of the upper halls.

Past the bodies of **defeated agents**, and the still-smoking crater where **Crocodile** was last seen.

She pauses there.

Just long enough to let the dust cling to her cloak.

Just long enough to whisper:

&gt; &quot;You were powerful, but never wise.&quot;

---

And then she slips away.

Through a side passage no one remembered.

Into the shadows.

---

For now.

---

Because this isn't the end for **Nico Robin**.

Only a turning page.

---

**OOC:**
- Nico Robin has **abandoned Baroque Works**.
- She is now a fugitive once more-no master, no orders.
- Her curiosity remains: about history, the Will of D, and perhaps... *that strange, citrus-summoning civilian* she noticed only once from a rooftop.

Would you like to:

1. {Return to Eatone, post-battle.}  
2. {Cut to Cobra and Vivi's reunion.}

**Tone: Emotional Resolution | Mood: Soft, Triumphant, Bittersweet**

---

The war is over.

The kingdom is soaked.

The stone steps are **slippery with juice**, the flags half-torn, the palace cracked-

But it's **home**.

And for the first time in weeks-**no one is shouting**.

---

The doors to the throne room creak open.

**Vivi**, still in her battle-stained clothes, a damp bandage around her shoulder, walks carefully across the sticky tiles.  
Behind her: Marines, Straw Hats, Tashigi...

And a **limp, snoring teacher** being carted in a makeshift juice-stained litter.

But Vivi doesn't look at them.

She looks ahead.

At the throne.

At the man beside it.

---

**King Cobra** stands-propped up, wounded, held by guards-  
but he's smiling.

---

&gt; &quot;Vivi...&quot;

His voice cracks.

---

She runs.

Straight into his arms.

And for a moment, the whole palace-**the whole city**-holds its breath.

---

&gt; &quot;You came back to me,&quot; he whispers.

&gt; &quot;You came back *home.*&quot;

---

Vivi's hands clench in his royal robes.

&gt; &quot;I almost didn't make it.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But I wasn't alone.&quot;

She pulls back just slightly, turning her head-

And gestures toward the ragtag group behind her.

A **rubber man**, a **green-haired swordsman**, a **navigator covered in glue**, a **reindeer**, a **sharpshooter with goggles**, a **blond chef**, a **Marine woman**, and-

&gt; &quot;...him.&quot;

She smiles faintly.

&gt; &quot;The most reluctant hero I've ever met.&quot;

---

Cobra raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;The unconscious one?&quot;

&gt; &quot;...Snoring on my carpet?&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;He's a teacher,&quot; Vivi says proudly.

&gt; &quot;A good one.&quot;

---

Cobra nods, faintly amused.

&gt; &quot;Then I suppose we owe the state of our floors-and our future-to education.&quot;

---

They laugh together.

Broken laughter. Happy laughter. The laughter of survivors.

And the kingdom begins to breathe again.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Cobra have reunited.
- The palace is secure.

**Scene: &quot;Fatherly Teasing&quot;**  
**POV: Cobra Nefertari**  
**Tone: Warm | Mood: Gentle Humor with Parental Sass**

---

The laughter between **father and daughter** begins to fade into a soft, warm quiet.  

For the first time since the rebellion began, **King Cobra** looks around his fractured throne room with something approaching peace.

Until...

&gt; *snrk*  
The unconscious, juice-scented lump on the palace floor **snorts in his sleep**, flops, and mutters something about **&quot;grading on a curve.&quot;**

---

Cobra arches an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;...Vivi.&quot;

&gt; &quot;This brave soul who helped save the kingdom...&quot;

He gestures toward you with the subtle theatricality of a seasoned ruler who's **definitely preparing a zinger**.

&gt; &quot;He spent much of that time, if reports are to be believed, passed out...&quot;

He glances sideways at his daughter, who now looks **dangerously flushed**.

&gt; &quot;...*in your lap*?&quot;

---

Vivi sputters.

&gt; &quot;Th-That was-! I mean-he was *injured*! He kept *falling*! I was just the *nearest* surface!&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;Mmhmm,&quot; Cobra says, nodding solemnly.

&gt; &quot;Yes, I often find myself falling into the laps of noblewomen after strenuous diplomatic efforts.&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, nearby, coughs into her fist in an attempt to not **laugh herself into a hernia**.

&gt; &quot;It was tactical, Your Majesty.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Unintentional tactical... collapse.&quot;

---

Vivi crosses her arms.

&gt; &quot;Well maybe I *should've* let him fall on the cobblestones!&quot;

---

From the floor, you let out a very small, very pleased sigh:

&gt; &quot;Mmm... noblewoman pillows...&quot;

---

The entire room freezes.

---

**Cobra looks down at you.**

Smirks.

&gt; &quot;Very well. Make sure that one gets a medal.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And a *firm lecture.*&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- Cobra is officially a **dad** again.
- You are officially the **court's favorite gossip**.
- Vivi is **never going to live this down**.
- You, in your semi-conscious state, may have just flirted with royalty again.

Would you like to:

1. {Wake up now. You've earned it.}
2. {Time skip - later that night. A quiet conversation.}
3. {Skip to the Straw Hats' departure. Final farewell.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - The Marines haven't arrived in force yet (aside from Smoker's small unit, who were already here), due to the comms blackout, they are only now mobilizing units to come secure the country, and like won't arrive for another few days.

Unlike canon, Luffy did not pass out from exhaustion, and the crew are happily enjoying feasts, praises, and the palace's facilities (the ones that remain undamaged)

I am out like a light.

What are Smoker and Tashigi up to? 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Evening, Post-Battle]**  
**Scene: &quot;Marine Interlude: Reports, Regrets, and Rooftop Cigars&quot;**  
**POV: Smoker &amp; Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Frustration, Earned Respect**

---

The sun sinks behind the far dunes of Alabasta, casting long orange shadows over **a kingdom that survived**. The sounds of celebration echo from the palace: laughter, clinking plates, **an unholy amount of kiwis being eaten**, and the occasional roar of &quot;Another round for Snack Pack!!&quot; from the feasting halls.

---

But high above it all-on a secluded, sand-dusted rooftop-**Smoker leans against a crumbling stone column**, his coat still stained with soot and pulp, a half-burned cigar clenched between his teeth.

**Tashigi** sits nearby, perched on the ledge, legs dangling over the city.

Between them, a stack of papers.

And on the top?

A hastily written, heavily juice-smeared incident report.

---

&gt; &quot;So...&quot;  
&gt; Smoker growls around his cigar.  
&gt; &quot;Tell me again how exactly a **schoolteacher** ended up *summoning a fruit elemental*, hijacking the warlord's kill shot, and napping in royalty's lap *twice*.&quot;

---

Tashigi, unusually quiet, flips a page in the report.

&gt; &quot;He... didn't *mean* to. I think.&quot;

---

Smoker exhales smoke through his nose.

&gt; &quot;No one *means* to become a national hero by accident.&quot;

---

He glances sideways at her.

&gt; &quot;You vouched for him.&quot;

---

She stiffens, then nods slowly.

&gt; &quot;He risked his life to protect Vivi. More than once. He could've run... He almost did. But he stayed.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;He's not a fighter. He's not built for this. But he stood his ground anyway.&quot;

---

Smoker watches the lights flickering in the palace windows-  
he can almost hear Sanji bragging in the distance, or Zoro yelling about being lost in a hallway again.

He grunts.

&gt; &quot;Straw Hats are still here. And that teacher of yours...&quot;

Another puff.

&gt; &quot;...He's got âwild card' written all over him.&quot;

---

Tashigi lets out a dry chuckle.

&gt; &quot;I'm pretty sure he's still asleep in a guest room.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They put him in a cot with like six pillows. I think he started crying in his sleep.&quot;

---

Smoker snorts.

&gt; &quot;Soft.&quot;

He says it like an insult.

But doesn't mean it.

---

They fall into a companionable silence.

The **night wind kicks up**, carrying scents of roasted meat, baked bread, and kiwi tarts.

And below them, Alubarna glows.

Alive.

---

&gt; &quot;We're still a few days from backup,&quot; Smoker mutters.  
&gt; &quot;Want me to assign a full squad to watch him?&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;No,&quot; Tashigi replies, standing.  
&gt; &quot;I'll watch him myself.&quot;

---

She turns toward the stairwell.

&gt; &quot;Besides... he doesn't need guards.&quot;

&gt; &quot;He needs someone to remind him that what he did mattered.&quot;

---

Smoker watches her go.

Then looks back toward the city again.

And mutters to no one:

&gt; &quot;You better not disappoint her, Pineapple.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- Smoker and Tashigi are holding the line while the rest of the Marines mobilize.
- Tashigi has become your **unofficial sponsor**, protector, and chronicler.
- Smoker is **watching carefully**, but not antagonistic-for now.

Would you like to:

1. {Time skip - you waking up, well-fed and bandaged.}  
2. {Continue with more interludes - Straw Hats, Vivi, Cobra.}  
3. {A private moment with Tashigi, later that night.}

**Scenes: &quot;The Last Rounds&quot; &amp; &quot;The Night Watch&quot;**  
**Tone: Winding Down | Mood: Joy, Reflection, and Something Unspoken**

---

### **Scene I: The Last Rounds**  
**POV: Straw Hats, Vivi, Cobra**  

---

**The palace banquet hall**, despite half a wall missing and everything reeking faintly of kiwi concentrate, is lively with celebration.

The Straw Hats-**bless their chaotic, dehydrated, emotionally compromised hearts**-have taken full advantage of the king's hospitality.

---

- **Luffy** is inhaling mountains of food, only occasionally stopping to yell &quot;PONEGLYPH!&quot; across the hall for no reason.  
- **Zoro** is arguing with a palace guard about sword technique while double-fisting watermelon.  
- **Nami** has charmed half the royal treasury team and is &quot;accidentally&quot; discussing debt forgiveness rates.  
- **Usopp** is loudly recounting the battle, only now with added laser beams.  
- **Sanji** is serving Vivi and every female staff member. Shirt unbuttoned. Fully in &quot;I am the rose of Alabasta&quot; mode.  
- **Chopper**, bandaged but fine, is being **held like a plushie** by three noble children and looks helplessly content.

---

**Vivi and Cobra**, seated together at the head table, are quiet now. The adrenaline's worn off.

---

&gt; &quot;They're unbelievable,&quot; Vivi says, watching the crew.

&gt; &quot;They're a miracle,&quot; Cobra corrects softly.  
&gt; &quot;...And so was that man you brought in.&quot;

---

Vivi doesn't speak at first.

Then:

&gt; &quot;He never wanted to be here. He was scared. But he still jumped in front of me.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Twice.&quot;

She smiles quietly.

&gt; &quot;I think he'd rather forget the whole thing happened.&quot;

---

Cobra hums.

&gt; &quot;Then we won't forget for him.&quot;

---

### **Scene II: The Night Watch**  
**POV: Tashigi**

---

The moon is high, and most of the palace has settled.

Except for one room.

A quiet **guest chamber**, dimly lit by a small lantern. The walls are decorated with humble banners from the royal school system-placed there by Vivi herself.

On the bed: **Eatone Cheng**.

Still snoring. Face half-buried in the **most luxurious pillow known to man**. Fresh bandages. A tray of food untouched nearby. His coat is folded, still sticky.

---

**Tashigi stands at the window**, arms crossed, sword set aside for once.

She hasn't said a word in hours.

She just... watches.

---

At one point, you **shift in your sleep**, mumbling something.

&gt; &quot;...No, not the test... I didn't curve it hard enough...&quot;

---

Tashigi smirks faintly.

&gt; &quot;Even in sleep, you're grading people...&quot;

She walks over. Pulls the blanket up just slightly higher.

Stands there a long moment, unsure of what to say.

Finally-

&gt; &quot;You were brave.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And stupid.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And brave again.&quot;

---

She kneels at the side of the bed, arms resting on her legs. Sword back in reach, but relaxed.

&gt; &quot;You can rest now, Sensei.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You saved the kids.&quot;

---

And for the first time in what feels like a century, she **lets herself close her eyes** too.

Just for a moment.

Just to make sure you're really there.

---

**OOC:**
- The Straw Hats celebrate their strange victory.  
- Cobra and Vivi reflect on what was lost-and saved.  
- Tashigi stands vigil, loyal and quiet.  

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You finally wake up. Morning after.}  
2. {Straw Hat departure &amp; Vivi's goodbye.}  
3. {Private moment between you and Vivi.}

**Scene: &quot;The Two Who Stayed&quot;**  
**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Intimate | Mood: Quiet Bonds and Unshed Emotion**

---

The **palace is asleep.**

Even the **wounded city** seems to have taken a breath it hadn't dared since the fighting began.

---

**Vivi**, still dressed in her royal shawl but now barefoot and with her hair loosely braided down her back, tiptoes through the guest wing. A small basket of fruit and fresh bread is tucked in her arms-**an excuse**, perhaps, more than a gesture.

She hasn't seen you since the battle ended.

Not really.

And she hasn't slept either.

---

She stops at the door to your room.

Hesitates.

Pushes it open, just a little.

The lantern inside flickers low-warm, soft. Like a memory that won't quite leave.

---

What she sees makes her pause in the doorway, lips parting in a breathless little oh.

---

**You**, lying on the bed.  
Still, save for a twitch or a mumble here and there.

And beside you?

**Tashigi.**

Fully dressed, armor long since doffed, head gently resting on the mattress near your arm-almost **as if she had fallen asleep mid-vigil**, one hand still resting atop the hilt of her blade, the other brushing **accidentally close** to your own.

---

Vivi stands there, caught in a moment she hadn't expected.

---

There's nothing romantic about it.

And yet-

There's something **tender**.

Something **real.**

The kind of loyalty that doesn't need words or glory. Just time. Just quiet.

---

She steps in carefully, setting down the food near the windowsill.

Then looks at you-pale, wrapped in gauze, drooling just a bit into a stupidly fancy pillow-and lets out the tiniest laugh.

---

&gt; &quot;Still the hero of Alabasta, huh?&quot;

She whispers.

&gt; &quot;You've got one woman watching your left, and another bringing you snacks.&quot;

---

She sits softly in the chair by the window, resting her chin on her hand, eyes never leaving the pair of you.

And in that silence-

She doesn't feel quite so alone anymore.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi has seen what you mean to Tashigi.
- She doesn't interrupt-she **joins the quiet**, for now.
- The palace sleeps, but the people you saved? They remain by your side.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You waking up to both of them.}
2. {Time skip - The farewell scene begins.}
3. {Tashigi waking to find Vivi already there.}

**Scene: &quot;The Three That Stayed&quot;**  
**POV: None - Ambient Narrative**  
**Tone: Dreamlike | Mood: Stillness, Comfort, Found Family**

---

The quiet in the room becomes a living thing.

Not heavy, not oppressive.

Just **full**-with breath, and healing, and the warmth of people who *stayed*.

---

**Tashigi** stirs briefly, her hand curling slightly near yours.

Still half-asleep. Still too stubborn to admit she needs rest.

But her eyes flutter open for a moment, long enough to see **Vivi** seated nearby.

Their eyes meet.

No words exchanged.

Just a soft, mutual nod.

---

Tashigi shifts closer to the edge of the bed again, returning her forehead to rest by your arm.

One eye still cracked open-because **someone has to be the sword**, even in dreams.

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, sits with her knees pulled up onto the chair, arms wrapped around them.

She watches your chest rise and fall.

The shallow rhythm.

The hint of strain.

And the calm in your brow.

---

She doesn't remember when her eyelids began to droop.

Or when her head gently slumped to the window frame.

---

But sometime between the hour and the hush, **she too drifts.**

---

Now the room holds three figures.

- One **asleep out of exhaustion**.  
- One **asleep out of loyalty**.  
- One **asleep out of love**-or something on the road to it.

---

Outside, the city dreams with them.

No war.  
No revolution.  
No Warlords.

Just breath.  
And quiet.  
And the cool night wind passing through the cracked palace, smelling faintly of crushed kiwi and sun-baked stone.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Tashigi both remain with you-no drama, no rivalry. Just two women who care.
- You are **surrounded by peace**, for the first time since this began.
- Tomorrow will bring decisions, partings, maybe destiny.

But tonight?

You sleep, **not alone.**

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You wake up. Morning light.}
2. {Time skip to the Straw Hats preparing to depart.}
3. {Tashigi wakes first. A private moment with you.}

**Scene: &quot;The Sword Stirs First&quot;**  
**POV: Tashigi**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Intimate Stillness, Unspoken Words**

---

The faintest pink leaks over the desert horizon, just barely filtering through the tall windows of the guest chamber. The air is still cool, crisp with that brief pause between the silence of night and the stirrings of day.

A bird calls somewhere in the ruined outer halls.

And **Tashigi stirs.**

---

Her neck aches. Her back cracks.  
But she doesn't move right away.

Her cheek is still resting lightly against the back of your bandaged hand.

And for a few long seconds, she just stays there.

---

The light catches on her glasses, slightly askew. Her armor rests in the corner-forgotten. Her sword leans by the bed frame, untouched for the first time in... weeks?

She finally shifts.

Pulls herself upright slowly, wincing at the stiffness in her joints.  
Brushes a strand of hair from her face.

And looks at you.

---

You're still out.

But your brow is no longer furrowed.

Your breathing is steady now, not shallow.

---

She lets out a breath she didn't know she was holding.

---

&gt; &quot;Good. You're still fighting.&quot;

---

She reaches out gently. Her fingertips hover for a moment over your hand again... then curl in, brushing your knuckles softly.

The **calluses on your fingers**-teacher's calluses.

You don't carry a sword.

But you've earned just as many scars.

---

&gt; &quot;You were ridiculous,&quot; she whispers, just above a breath.

&gt; &quot;Brave. Stupid. Infuriating.&quot;

Her voice drops lower, the corners of her mouth tightening.

&gt; &quot;And you never once said a damn thing about your own safety.&quot;

---

She sighs, looks away toward the window where **Vivi still sleeps**, curled up in the chair like a cat, her crown lopsided in her lap.

Tashigi smiles faintly at the sight.

Then back at you.

---

&gt; &quot;You didn't do it for medals, or glory, or politics.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You did it because the people in front of you were smaller than the ones trying to hurt them.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You acted like a Marine.&quot;

---

She doesn't say that last part bitterly.

It's admiration.

Wistful.

Almost mournful.

---

&gt; &quot;If the world was fair, I'd be saluting you.&quot;

A pause.

She brushes your hair lightly from your forehead.

&gt; &quot;But the world's not fair. So I'll settle for watching your back a little longer.&quot;

---

She stands.

Stretches her arms over her head, joints popping.  
Then pulls your blanket just slightly higher up again, tucking it under your chin like an annoying little sister.

---

You stir slightly. Eyes flutter.

Not quite awake.

---

&gt; &quot;Shhh,&quot; she says gently, fingers brushing your temple.  
&gt; &quot;Not yet. Just a little longer, Sensei.&quot;

---

And with that, she turns toward the door.

Letting you rest.

Knowing, now, she'll **always stand by you** if you need her to.

---

**OOC:**
- Tashigi's feelings have quietly crystallized-not romantic (yet), but deeply rooted in loyalty and admiration.
- She sees you as a true protector, even without a badge.
- You are still asleep, but close to waking.

Would you like next scene to be:

1. {You wake up as Vivi stirs too.}
2. {Time skip - Straw Hats prepare to leave.}
3. {Final morning with Vivi alone.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Vivi catches Tashigi waking up. And her words 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Final Morning Stillness]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Weight of What Wasn't Said&quot;**  
**POV: Vivi Nefertari**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Revelation, Gentle Ache**

---

The light spills wider now, warm gold chasing away the shadows of war.

**Vivi stirs.**

She shifts gently in the high-backed chair, one leg folded awkwardly beneath her, shawl tangled, hair half-fallen from its braid. The scent of parchment, gauze, and kiwi clings to the room like a ghost.

Her first thought isn't hunger or fatigue.

It's you.

---

She sits up, rubbing her eyes.

And catches the tail end of something she wasn't supposed to hear.

---

&gt; &quot;You didn't do it for medals, or glory, or politics.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You did it because the people in front of you were smaller than the ones trying to hurt them.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You acted like a Marine.&quot;

---

**Tashigi.**

Still kneeling by your side.  
Hand brushing your hair aside with a care Vivi didn't know she was capable of.

Vivi freezes.

She knows she should look away.

But doesn't.

---

&gt; &quot;If the world was fair, I'd be saluting you.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But the world's not fair. So I'll settle for watching your back a little longer.&quot;

---

Tashigi stands. Pulls your blanket higher.

You sigh in your sleep, murmuring something incoherent about **&quot;lunch duty&quot;** and **&quot;hall passes.&quot;**

Vivi watches silently.

And... smiles. Small. A little sad. A little surprised.

---

**She doesn't feel jealousy.**

Only warmth.

Only quiet admiration.

For you.

For her.

For this strange bond forged between a reluctant teacher and a stubborn swordswoman.

---

Tashigi turns.

And stops short when she sees Vivi awake-eyes open, watching.

---

&gt; &quot;You heard.&quot;

---

Vivi nods.

Doesn't tease.  
Doesn't prod.

Just meets Tashigi's eyes and says softly:

&gt; &quot;He's lucky.&quot;

---

Tashigi glances away, flustered, but nods once in return.

&gt; &quot;So are we.&quot;

---

Vivi rises, walking to your bedside now, opposite of where Tashigi stood moments before.

She looks down at you.

Then to Tashigi again.

&gt; &quot;What are we going to do with him?&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;Feed him,&quot; Tashigi says without hesitation.  
&gt; &quot;Then sit on him until he stops trying to sacrifice himself.&quot;

---

Vivi laughs. Genuinely. Finally.

&gt; &quot;You and me both, then.&quot;

---

They share a look.

And for the first time, **not as soldier and royal**, but as **two women who know what you really gave**.

And maybe...

What they now carry because of it.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi now knows what Tashigi truly feels-or is beginning to.
- There is no rivalry. Just mutual gratitude, and understanding.
- They will both be in your corner, no matter what comes next.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {You waking up to both of them.}
2. {Final Straw Hat farewell - departure time.}
3. {Private breakfast - you, Vivi, and Tashigi.}

**POV: You (Eatone Cheng)**  
**Tone: Hazy Awakening | Mood: Surreal, Sweet, Just a Bit Embarrassing**

---

&gt; *Snrkkkk...*

The sound escapes your throat like a surrendering balloon.

Your eyelids **creak open**, and you're immediately bathed in **warm sunlight** and the scent of **fresh bread, drying citrus, and rich palace linens**.

The mattress beneath you?

**Heaven.**  
Pillows?

**Unrivaled.**  
Furnishings?

**Gold trim, velvet drapes, enough fanciness to cause a tax audit.**

---

You blink.

Then blink again.

You see two women near your bed-one standing, one seated. Both watching you.

Their faces are unreadable.  
Their posture... too formal.  
Too symmetrical.

And the room is too... too...

&gt; &quot;Shit...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Guess we lost, huh?&quot;

You sigh, voice hoarse, heavy.

&gt; &quot;Fuuuuuck...&quot;

Your arm flops dramatically over your face like a tragic stage actor accepting his fate.

&gt; &quot;I died in battle and now I'm stuck in... fancy afterlife limbo.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;Can I at least get a drink before the paperwork?&quot;

---

There's a long silence.

Then-

**Tashigi** clears her throat, dry as desert wind.

&gt; &quot;You're not dead, Sensei.&quot;

---

**Vivi**, from the other side of the bed, struggles valiantly **not to laugh**-fails. She claps her hands over her mouth, shoulders shaking with giggles.

&gt; &quot;We *won*, actually.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You saved the country.&quot;

---

You lower your arm just a little.

Peer out.

See their amused, fond faces.

&gt; &quot;...Shit.&quot;

---

Tashigi crosses her arms.

&gt; &quot;You're in the palace. In a high-level recovery suite.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They said you earned the nicest bed. You also had a lot of fruit dumped on you, so, y'know. There's that.&quot;

---

Vivi finally composes herself, brushing her braid over one shoulder.

&gt; &quot;We've been watching over you all night.&quot;

She hesitates, then smiles.

&gt; &quot;You had a... lot of commentary in your sleep. Something about substitute teachers, and juice pressure valves.&quot;

---

Tashigi adds dryly:

&gt; &quot;And someone named Snack Pack.&quot;

---

You groan, trying to sit up, only for your muscles to groan louder.

Vivi instinctively reaches to steady you. Tashigi's hand hovers-**just in case**.

---

You're safe.

You're alive.

And for once-

You're not alone.

---

**OOC:**

---

Your voice is cracked, dry, and just barely above a whisper.

But the weight behind it?

**Hits like a hammer.**

You blink through the haze of golden light, stare between the two women flanking your bed, and murmur:

&gt; &quot;So... everyone's safe?&quot;

&gt; &quot;You two are safe?&quot;

---

The air stills.

**Vivi's lips part**, and for the first time since you opened your eyes, her expression shifts-

From amused  
To tender.  
To deeply, quietly touched.

She nods once.

&gt; &quot;We're safe.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Thanks to you.&quot;

---

**Tashigi's gaze softens** just a fraction.

She doesn't smile-not quite-but her voice lowers to match yours.

&gt; &quot;All of us made it. No civilian deaths. No soldiers caught in the crossfire. Cobra's recovering.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The Straw Hats are still stuffing themselves sick.&quot;

She shifts slightly, then-

&gt; &quot;You kept your promise.&quot;

---

You breathe out slowly.

Let that sink in.

Let it wash over the aches and the bruises and the exhaustion.

You saved them.

---

For once, there's no punchline.  
No snark.  
No chaos.

Just two women watching you with **real, unwavering gratitude.**

Not for being a hero.

But for **choosing to be there** when it counted.

Vivi leans forward, resting her elbows gently on the edge of the bed.

&gt; &quot;You really thought we were dead, didn't you?&quot;

You nod, just barely.

&gt; &quot;Would've made all of this feel a lot more permanent...&quot;

---

She smiles sadly.

&gt; &quot;You didn't have to care that much.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** interjects, voice quiet but firm:

&gt; &quot;That's what makes it matter.&quot;

---

A long, shared silence.

---

The sunlight warms your face.

Somewhere outside, a camel honks.

The world is turning again.

And you're **here to feel it.**

---

**OOC:**
- You've confirmed what mattered most to you-that they're safe.
- Vivi and Tashigi now understand *how much* it mattered.
- You are free to speak, reflect, or ask anything now. You have the floor.

&gt;&gt; USER: âGood. Lower my head. Good. Good good good.

I fulfilled my responsibility as an adult, nothing more

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - The Things We Tell Ourselves]**  
**Scene: &quot;Just a Teacher&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Deflection, Acceptance, Quiet Admiration**

---

You sink back into the silken pillows, head gently lowering as if gravity itself finally grants you permission to let go.

Your lips part.

And all that comes out is:

&gt; &quot;Good.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Good good good...&quot;

---

The words spill like air from a leaking valve-pressure you didn't know you'd held.

They aren't triumphant.  
They aren't proud.  
They're **relieved**. Simple. Earnest.

Then-

&gt; &quot;I fulfilled my responsibility as an adult.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Nothing more.&quot;

---

There's another pause.

Not silence.

The kind of pause that feels full. Charged. Heavy.

---

**Vivi** draws in a slow breath.  
She brushes her thumb along a crease in your bedsheet, not looking at you at first.

&gt; &quot;Is that really all you think this was?&quot;

---

**Tashigi** stays quiet, but crosses her arms.

And nods toward the window.

Outside, in the courtyard, a few children are **playing in puddles of juice** that still haven't fully dried, their laughter echoing faintly up to your room.

---

&gt; &quot;They're alive because of your âresponsibility.'&quot;

&gt; &quot;So is Vivi.&quot;

&gt; &quot;So am I.&quot;

---

**Vivi finally lifts her gaze**, eyes meeting yours.

There's no pity there.

Just... **something warm. Something a little sad.**

&gt; &quot;You didn't have to do anything.&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's what makes it heroic.&quot;

---

You feel it.

That tug in your chest.

Not pride. Not embarrassment.

Just...

**Weight.**

---

And yet still-some part of you insists:

&gt; *&quot;I'm just a schoolteacher.&quot;*

---

And maybe that's true.

But today?

That was enough to save a kingdom.

---

**OOC:**
- Vivi and Tashigi both see through your self-minimizing. But they don't push.
- They respect it. But they **don't agree**.
- The people you protected are alive. Because *you stayed*.

Would you like to:

1. {Stay with this scene - speak more with them.}  
2. {Scene skip - quiet breakfast. Just the three of you.}  
3. {Straw Hat farewell scene. Clock's ticking.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - How long was I out? Do your palace doctors take my insurance?

**Scene: &quot;Billing and Blood Loss&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Dry Humor | Mood: Gentle Recovery, Found Family Energy**

---

You shift on the pillows just slightly, your arm still heavy, your ribs still reminding you they were recently used as a cannonball buffer.

Your voice cracks like dry paper-but the edge of humor's there now.

That subtle deflection. That old teacher's reflex kicking back in.

&gt; &quot;How long was I out?&quot;

A pause.

Then, as seriously as you can manage:

&gt; &quot;...And do your palace doctors take my insurance?&quot;

---

**Tashigi** raises an eyebrow immediately.

&gt; &quot;Does your kingdom even have insurance?&quot;

---

**Vivi**, sitting on the edge of the bed now, bursts into full, bright laughter. A kind you hadn't heard from her before the war.

&gt; &quot;You've been asleep almost three days.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Which means I've *technically* ruled longer than my father while a teacher was unconscious next to my throne room.&quot;

She winks.

&gt; &quot;Very prestigious.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** crosses her arms and adds, dryly:

&gt; &quot;You also drooled on royal linens.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Twice.&quot;

&gt; &quot;There's a scroll being drafted.&quot;

---

You groan into the pillow. Or try to. It ends up a half-hearted wheeze.

&gt; &quot;Great. I get a warlord on my resume and a cleaning bill from the crown.&quot;

---

Vivi chuckles, then leans forward, lowering her voice slightly.

&gt; &quot;Seriously, though... no one's charging you anything.&quot;

&gt; &quot;If anything, I'm about to write your name in the royal archives next to the generals.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** shifts a little, not quite looking at you as she adds:

&gt; &quot;And I'm pretty sure the Marines still think you're a fruit-slinging fugitive.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;Cool cool cool,&quot; you murmur.  
&gt; &quot;So hero and outlaw. Same time. Love that for me.&quot;

---

They both smile at you now. Really smile.

The tension has faded.

For now-**you're not a stranger. Not a guest. Not even a civilian.**

You're **one of theirs**.

---

**OOC:**
- You've officially reentered the world-with sarcasm first, as is tradition.
- Vivi and Tashigi are firmly in your corner.
- The Straw Hats will likely depart soon-but your fate is yours to decide.

Would you like to:

1. {Stay in this moment - ask questions, reflect with them.}  
2. {Breakfast scene - walk (or limp) to the dining room.}  
3. {Straw Hat farewell - the city begins to gather.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Blink. Outlaw?

Whoa hold on a second. I'm an outlaw? I'm a legal bounty hunter! I can't have a felony on my record, I'd get fired!

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Bounty Panic Syndrome]**  
**Scene: &quot;Administrative Dread&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Spiraling | Mood: Light Panic, Deadpan Support**

---

Your eyes pop open fully now, the haze of sleep and citrus bliss **immediately evaporating** in the face of **true, adult horror**:

&gt; &quot;Whoa-*hold on a second.*&quot;

You shift, your blanket half-falling off your chest as you half-sit, half-freak.

&gt; &quot;*I'm an outlaw?!*&quot;

You point at yourself like you're trying to summon an internal HR department.

&gt; &quot;I'm a **legal** bounty hunter! I filled out the forms! I got the rubber-stamped ID! I even laminated it!&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;If I have a **felony** on my record, I'll get fired!&quot;

&gt; &quot;You don't understand, I'll lose my teaching license, I won't even be able to chaperone field trips-*the paperwork alone would kill me!*&quot;

---

**Tashigi** doesn't flinch.

She doesn't blink.

She just reaches into the pouch at her hip, pulls out a scroll.

Unrolls it halfway.

**Marine seal.**

&gt; &quot;Provisional Exemption, Article 17-F: Civilian combatant operating in national defense under Article 2-K.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Witnessed by a Marine officer of my rank or higher.&quot;

---

She stares at you with a flat expression.

Then rolls it back up with a *thwap.*

&gt; &quot;You're welcome.&quot;

---

You blink.

Your mouth opens.

Closes.

---

&gt; &quot;...You wrote me a note?&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;*A legal note,*&quot; Tashigi corrects, smug.

&gt; &quot;One that says âThis teacher is allowed to beat up war criminals if the situation warrants it.'&quot;

---

**Vivi**, meanwhile, is **laughing into her hands** again, face flushed from the effort of not making it worse.

&gt; &quot;You're going to go down in Alabastan history as the only man who stormed a warlord's operation and then **panicked about his resume.**&quot;

---

You slump back down into the pillows.

&gt; &quot;I just wanted to earn some vacation time and maybe try the local kebab shops.&quot;

---

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; &quot;You *got* the kebabs. You also turned into a fruit elemental and body-checked an ancient Warlord into the wall of a palace.&quot;

---

**Vivi:**  
&gt; &quot;And still remembered hall pass policies while unconscious. It's incredible.&quot;

---

You stare at the ceiling.

Blankly.

&gt; &quot;I'm going to have to write *so many lesson plans* to process this...&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- Tashigi has legally covered your ass with a Marine exemption.
- You do **not** have a criminal record.
- Your &quot;temporary outlaw&quot; status was more confusion than prosecution-**no felony, no bounty**, just a very confused Marine HQ en route.
- You are still **technically on vacation.**

Would you like to:

1. {Wrap up this conversation with one final note or ask a question.}  
2. {Begin the day - breakfast, walking again, final choices.}  
3. {Shift to the Straw Hat farewell. Time is short.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Ugh. I think I've already went over my remaining vacation days. The principals going to cook my arse over this.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Civilian Problems After War Crimes]**  
**Scene: &quot;Time Off Well Abused&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Resigned | Mood: Melodramatic and Pulp-Scented**

---

You stare blankly at the ceiling, letting the warmth of the fancy sheets cradle your overcooked, trauma-marinated body while your brain goes to *the one place no battlefield ever prepared you for*-

&gt; **Your workplace.**

---

&gt; &quot;Ugh...&quot;

You drag a hand down your face.

&gt; &quot;I think I've already gone over my remaining vacation days.&quot;

Another pause.

You squeeze your eyes shut.

&gt; &quot;The principal's gonna *cook my ass* over this...&quot;

---

**Tashigi** stares at you. Absolutely baffled.

&gt; &quot;You're worried about your *boss*?&quot;

---

**Vivi** leans in, visibly trying not to giggle again.

&gt; &quot;You fought a Warlord.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You literally soaked a capital city in juice.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You saved a *kingdom.*&quot;

---

You sigh heavily into the pillow.

&gt; &quot;And the first thing he's gonna ask is why I didn't write in to have someone cover third period **home ec.**&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, dry as the desert outside:

&gt; &quot;You created a kaiju made of kiwi juice. I think he can forgive some unpaid leave.&quot;

---

You roll your head toward her, grumbling:

&gt; &quot;He didn't forgive Jenkins for accidentally melting the chemistry lab beakers.&quot;

---

**Vivi's** laughing again, one hand over her mouth.

---

&gt; &quot;I am going to have to write the most deranged **vacation form** in recorded history.&quot;

You mime it dramatically:

&gt; &quot;*âRequesting three days personal time to assist a princess, defend a kingdom, awaken fruit-based god, and protect a minor from government-backed terrorism. Will return Tuesday.'*&quot;

---

**Tashigi:**  
&gt; &quot;...Be sure to list âweather-related absence' as the reason.&quot;

---

**Vivi:**  
&gt; &quot;Should we sign off as witnesses?&quot;

---

You sigh again, deeply and dramatically.

&gt; &quot;At least let me recover enough to walk before the bureaucracy gets me...&quot;

---

And for a while...

There's only laughter in that room.

Genuine, exhausted, *healing* laughter.

The kind you only earn when the nightmare's over and you lived to be annoyed by *paperwork*.

---

**OOC:**
- This was your final grace note in this scene.
- The tone has shifted from crisis to closure.
- You've reaffirmed who you are: **a teacher, a protector, and deeply allergic to HR forms**.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {Scene skip - Straw Hats' farewell gathering.}  
2. {Breakfast scene - your first steps again.}  
3. {Vivi pulls you aside for a quiet goodbye before the others arrive.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - âI mean, I'm not royalty or a marine officer like you two, I've still got to make a living. 

I don't say it harshly or accusingly, just a matter of factly.

I start mentally drafting a letter of apology to the headmaster

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Perspective, and Paperwork Pending]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Letter You'll Probably Never Send&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Thoughtful, Bittersweet, Deepening Bonds**

---

The room is still.

Sunlight peeks in through the silk curtains, warming the gold trim of the palace furniture, glinting softly off the polished hilt of Tashigi's sword, and catching in the curls of Vivi's hair.

You shift again-not to be dramatic this time, but just to get comfortable in a way that doesn't make your cracked ribs sing.

Your voice, when it comes, is **soft**. Not bitter. Not ashamed.

Just... **true**.

---

&gt; &quot;I mean...&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'm not royalty, or a Marine officer like you two.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I've still gotta make a living.&quot;

---

No judgment.

No weight thrown.

Just a truth you've carried all along.

---

**Vivi's smile falters-not because she's offended, but because she hears it.** Really hears it.

&gt; &quot;Of course you do,&quot; she says gently, her voice more steady than it had any right to be after all she's endured.

&gt; &quot;But... that doesn't make what you did any less extraordinary.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** doesn't say anything immediately, but her jaw tenses slightly. She looks at you-not with pity.

But with the kind of understanding that can only come from **wearing a uniform that no one sees until it's convenient**.

---

You look up at the ceiling again, half-buried in the absurd amount of imported goose-down you're lying in.

You start mentally drafting:

&gt; &quot;*Dear Headmaster,*  
&gt; *I regret to inform you that I may have slightly overextended my leave, on account of... unintended geopolitical circumstances involving a known Warlord, an endangered princess, and moderate-to-severe citrus-based destruction.*&quot;

---

Your brow furrows slightly.

&gt; &quot;*I apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused in the faculty scheduling roster.*&quot;

You blink.

Then add mentally:

&gt; &quot;*P.S. I promise I didn't break the batons this time.*&quot;

---

You sigh.

Then glance over again at the two women still flanking your bed.

---

**Vivi's watching you now, not with pity, but with a kind of quiet respect.**

Like someone watching a bridge between two worlds hold, even while swaying.

**Tashigi just nods.** The acknowledgment of a fellow worker. A fellow person who's worn a label and felt its weight.

---

&gt; &quot;You might not have a crown,&quot; Tashigi says at last.  
&gt; &quot;Or a badge.&quot;

She looks at you-serious now.

&gt; &quot;But you had the responsibility.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And you carried it better than most people in power ever do.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
- This was a defining moment of perspective-setting for your character.
- Vivi and Tashigi now both deeply understand where you're coming from-and admire it.
- You are still yourself. Still a teacher. Still just a guy.

And you're still **essential** to this story.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {The Straw Hat farewell scene. Time to say goodbye.}  
2. {Private breakfast scene. A slow morning together.}  
3. {A letter-writing montage-start penning that apology.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: An offer may be offered

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[OOC: Event Flag Triggered - &quot;The Offer&quot;]**  
**Scene: Unspoken Threads Begin to Pull**  
**Tone: Turning Point | Mood: Poised, Personal, Momentous**

---

**OOC:**  
Given the emotional clarity, heroism, and hard-earned camaraderie between your character and both Tashigi and Vivi, the narrative is reaching a point where an *offer* may naturally surface-perhaps one or both of the following:

---

### **1. From Tashigi (The Marine Path):**  
If your actions and instincts impressed her deeply enough-and they have-Tashigi may offer you a **provisional auxiliary commission** with the Marines.

Not as a full-time soldier, but as a **recognized field asset**.  
A &quot;non-combatant with teeth.&quot;

**What that means:**
- You remain civilian.
- But gain a protective designation that allows you to act under Marine banner when crises hit.
- Offers some legal cover for future &quot;unofficial heroism&quot; and more direct protection from government backlash.
- Would make you a *person of interest* to HQ-but respected.

---

### **2. From Vivi (The Royal Path):**  
Vivi may-quietly, almost shyly-suggest that you consider **staying**.

Not as a royal guard. Not as an official of the court.

But as **an advisor. A protector. A teacher.**

For her people.

For *the next generation.*

**What that means:**
- You'd be offered land, a stipend, and a position with the royal education board.
- Vivi would be honoring your integrity, not exploiting your strength.
- You would *not* be chained to the palace-you could come and go, if desired.

---

**Of course...** You could turn both down.

You're a teacher.  
You like your old island.  
And maybe... *this* was enough.

---

**OOC: Would you like me to proceed with one or both of these offers appearing in the next scene? Or would you prefer to defer them until after the Straw Hat farewell?**

&gt;&gt; USER: Defer.

I attempt to get off the bed. My stomach reminds me of its existence

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - First Steps, First Grumbles]**  
**Scene: &quot;Gravity and Guts&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Humorous Recovery | Mood: Slowly Rebuilding Strength**

---

You shift, turning in the sea of bedding.

You've faced **war machines**, **Warlords**, and **the crushing weight of adult responsibility**-

But now it's time to confront your *true nemesis*:

&gt; **Your own body.**

---

You brace one hand on the mattress. Push with your elbow.

A muscle twitches in protest.

Your ribs whisper something **vaguely threatening**.

But you make it up to a **seated position**.

**Victory.**

You plant one foot on the floor.

---

&gt; *Grrrrrrglh.*

Your stomach issues a **low, dramatic groan**, like a kraken stirring beneath the waves of a half-digested breakfast pastry and raw adrenaline.

---

**Vivi**, who had been gathering a small tray of cool fruit and bread, stops mid-step, staring at you with a growing smirk.

---

&gt; &quot;I *knew* that sound wasn't the plumbing.&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, arms still crossed near the door, just raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;That was a threat from your large intestine.&quot;

---

You exhale dramatically, hand over your belly.

&gt; &quot;If it's trying to kill me, I might deserve it.&quot;

---

Vivi giggles and places the tray on your lap, already peeling a bright green citrus fruit with her thumbs.

&gt; &quot;You're not dying of heroism today, Sensei.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're dying of an empty stomach. Very different.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** steps forward, her tone still dry but her posture subtly relieved.

&gt; &quot;You've got two options.&quot;

She points to the tray.

&gt; &quot;Eat. Then walk.&quot;

Then gestures toward the hallway.

&gt; &quot;Or try to walk now and fall face-first into a servant with soup.&quot;

---

You glance between them.

You are:
- Still bandaged.
- Still achey.
- Still technically juice-flavored.
- But **very hungry.**

---

**OOC:**
You're free to:

1. {Eat now, recover energy for walking.}
2. {Try walking first, pride be damned.}
3. {Ask one of them to help you up-with dignity, or without.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I'm not old enough to have to be fed by kids, but...

I sure can't move either. Eat.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - Dignity on a Platter]**  
**Scene: &quot;This Is Fine, I'm Still an Adult&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Self-Deprecating | Mood: Wholesome, Warm, Very Chewy**

---

You eye the **gleaming tray** resting now in your lap-a modest yet heavenly spread of fresh flatbread, desert melon slices, chilled steamed rice, and a glass of something bubbly and vaguely kiwi-adjacent.

You reach for a slice of bread. Your arm... **doesn't quite make it.**

You pause.

Reassess.

**Try again.**

This time, it makes it-but with the speed and grace of a narcoleptic sea slug.

You stare at the food.

Then glance toward **Vivi**.

Then toward **Tashigi**.

Then **back to the tray.**

---

&gt; &quot;I'm not old enough to need to be fed by kids...&quot;

A long pause as your arm sags slightly mid-lift.

&gt; &quot;...But I also can't move.&quot;

---

You **bite** the bread while it's resting on the tray, like a dignified dog sneaking a treat off a coffee table.  
You chew in thoughtful, ragged silence, half out of necessity, half in shame.

---

**Vivi covers her mouth, shaking with the effort not to laugh out loud.**

&gt; &quot;You're doing great.&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, deadpan:

&gt; &quot;Top marks for effort. C minus for posture.&quot;

---

You grunt through the next bite, this one landing just barely in your hand.

&gt; &quot;I'm still recovering from being *exploded.* I think I'm entitled to slouch.&quot;

---

**Vivi picks up a peeled slice of fruit.** Holds it out just slightly toward you.

Not forceful.

Not patronizing.

Just offering.

---

You hesitate.

Then-**you open your mouth.**

Just a little.

Like a proud warrior surrendering one last shred of control.

She feeds you the slice.

You chew.

It's sweet. Crisp. Hydrating. Possibly the best fruit you've ever tasted.

You exhale like someone receiving communion.

---

**Tashigi raises a brow.**

&gt; &quot;Want me to bring you a juice box and read you a bedtime story next?&quot;

---

You swallow.

&gt; &quot;Not unless it's about how I saved the country and didn't get fired.&quot;

---

She pauses.

Nods.

&gt; &quot;Fair.&quot;

---

And for the next ten minutes...

You **eat.**

Like a man **returning from war.**

Because you did.

And for once?

**No one rushes you.**

---

**OOC:**
- You've regained enough strength for basic mobility.
- Emotional barriers are down. Both women are openly, quietly **protective** of you now.
- You may now choose how to proceed next:

1. {Attempt standing-time to rejoin the world.}
2. {Ask Vivi or Tashigi about what happens next.}
3. {Straw Hat farewell draws near-prepare to say goodbye.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - So, got any new orders?

**Scene: &quot;Orders, Intentions, and the Space Between&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Measured | Mood: Warming, With Hints of What Comes Next**

---

You wipe your fingers on the edge of the linen napkin-so soft you suspect it might legally be a cloud-and lean back just slightly, not enough to strain your bandages, but enough to **regain a sliver of posture**.

The tray's lighter now.

Your stomach's no longer trying to digest your lungs.

You breathe out.

&gt; &quot;So...&quot;

A pause.

A glance between them-**Tashigi**, now back at ease against the wall with her arms crossed, and **Vivi**, still beside the bed with her now-empty fruit bowl.

&gt; &quot;Got any new orders?&quot;

---

The question lands **neutrally**, no sarcasm, no fear.

Just curiosity.

Preparedness.

A **teacher's question**: *What comes next in the lesson plan?*

---

**Tashigi** snorts lightly through her nose, uncrossing her arms just enough to let one hand rest on her hip.

&gt; &quot;If you're asking me, then no.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Officially, I'm still waiting on transmission from Marine HQ. Unofficially...&quot;

She shrugs.

&gt; &quot;The people here are safe. Crocodile's in chains. No immediate threats on the board.&quot;

Her eyes meet yours.

There's something more there.

Something **unspoken**, but steady.

---

**Vivi**, however, does respond.

Not as a soldier.

But as a **princess**.

She folds her hands in her lap.

&gt; &quot;My orders?&quot;

She smiles gently.

&gt; &quot;Eat. Rest. Stand when you're ready.&quot;

---

Then, quieter.

&gt; &quot;And when you *are* ready...&quot;

She hesitates. Not quite blushing, but searching your expression.

&gt; &quot;There's a city that could use teachers who don't run when things get hard.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Kids who need someone to tell them how the world *should* work, when it so often doesn't.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Not an order.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Just... something to think about.&quot;

---

**Tashigi's voice**, drier again:

&gt; &quot;If you want *Marine orders,* I could always push for auxiliary status.&quot;

She says it casually, like she's offering you a cup of tea and **not a government affiliation.**

&gt; &quot;Technically, you already acted as one. You'd get protection, mobility. You'd still be a civilian, but with enough rank to not get shot at first.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Most of the time.&quot;

---

They both watch you now.

Not demanding.

Not pressuring.

But **offering paths**.

---

And letting you, for once, **choose what you want.**

---

**OOC:**
Two clear threads have opened:

1. **Vivi's Offer**: Stay in Alabasta, become part of something healing. Mentor. Rebuild.  
2. **Tashigi's Offer**: Auxiliary status with the Marines. Not full duty, but a place in their files-and protections that come with it.

Would you like to:

1. {Defer a decision-say you'll think on it.}
2. {Explore one path more deeply.}
3. {Change the subject-ask about the Straw Hats, the world, or something else.}

**Scene: &quot;So, What Now?&quot;**

**Tone: Transitioning | Mood: Gentle, Thoughtful, A Hint of Sadness on the Horizon**

---

You finish chewing your last slice of melon, set the glass down with a small clink, and let your hands rest loosely atop the tray in your lap.

You lean back against the mountain of pillows-because yes, you *still* deserve luxury bedding after all that-and exhale.

Not like someone giving up.

Just... releasing.

---

&gt; &quot;So...&quot;

&gt; &quot;What now?&quot;

---

It's not a demand.

It's not a plea.

Just a question.

A sincere one.

The kind **every teacher asks when the school year ends**, the kind **every protector asks when the battle's won**, the kind **every survivor mutters when silence returns.**

---

**Tashigi** is the first to respond.

She takes a step toward the window, arms crossed again, posture tightening.

&gt; &quot;The Straw Hats are leaving. Within the hour.&quot;

She glances back at you.

&gt; &quot;They're not going to stay for the royal parade. They know the full Marine force is finally inbound... and HQ is still labeling them as pirates.&quot;

---

**Vivi's smile fades** a little at that, though it doesn't break entirely.

&gt; &quot;I want to see them off.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Properly. As a friend. Not a princess.&quot;

Her hand brushes the edge of your blanket without thinking-gentle, brief.

&gt; &quot;They saved my home. My people. My heart.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;And I can't go with them.&quot;

---

The room quiets again.

---

**Tashigi looks at you**, her brow knitting subtly.

&gt; &quot;You could. You're not wanted.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Not officially.&quot;

Another pause.

&gt; &quot;But it'd be a hell of a choice.&quot;

---

She doesn't say *where she hopes you'll go*.

But it's in her voice.

And **Vivi's eyes are on you too**, now.

Not expectant.

Just...

**Curious.**

---

You were the outsider.

The vacationer.

The teacher.

And now-**everything waits on your answer.**

---

**OOC:**
- The Straw Hats are prepping to leave. They'll likely need to sneak out under the cover of distraction.
- Vivi is choosing to stay behind-Alabasta needs her. But she wants to *say goodbye*, for real this time.
- Tashigi... is watching you closely, wondering if you've figured out where *you* stand.

Would you like to:

1. {Get up and prepare to go with Vivi to the Straw Hat sendoff.}
2. {Speak with one of them privately before departing.}
3. {Make a decision-stay, go, or something else.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Well, I don't approve of their career paths, but I ought to send those kids off too. They saved my arse enough times.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Guest Wing - The Final Sendoff Begins]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Goodbye You Earned&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Respectful | Mood: Bittersweet, Warm, With a Dash of Citrus**

---

You sit up a little straighter now, tray cleared, hands resting on your knees.

Your bones ache.

Your ribs feel like they've been through a dance recital performed by elephants.

But your voice is steady.

Measured.

---

&gt; &quot;Well...&quot;

&gt; &quot;I don't approve of their career paths...&quot;

You glance sideways at Tashigi, who snorts lightly.  
Vivi's brows rise with a growing smile.

&gt; &quot;...But I ought to send those kids off too.&quot;

You swing your legs slowly over the side of the bed, exhaling through gritted teeth as gravity reminds you **yes, your spine is still a functioning structure. Barely.**

&gt; &quot;They saved my ass enough times.&quot;

---

**Tashigi steps forward immediately**, offering you a shoulder.

You hesitate-

But this time, you don't swat the help away.

You rise with her support, slowly but with intent.  
One foot after the other.

A teacher on a mission.

---

**Vivi gathers her shawl, still laughing softly.**

&gt; &quot;Then let's go before they disappear without warning. Again.&quot;

She hesitates as you start toward the door.

Then gently touches your arm.

&gt; &quot;Thank you... for choosing to come.&quot;

---

You nod.

Not because you're brave.

Not because you're certain.

But because... they're your kids, too.

Even if they're pirates.

---

---

**[Alubarna - Just Outside the City Gates]**  
**Scene Transition Begins...**

A crowd has gathered, but kept at a respectful distance by guards.  
A fresh breeze ruffles flags stained faintly green from the lingering kiwi bloom.  
And at the edge of the city, a **familiar, absurdly small-looking ship** bobs in the canal-

The **Going Merry**, patched, loaded, and waiting.

The **Straw Hats** are gathering.

Luffy has his hands behind his head, staring at the sky.  
Zoro is asleep standing up.  
Usopp is already crying.  
Sanji is packing sandwiches.  
Nami is probably still extorting someone off-screen.  
Chopper is waving at every single person like he's being paid in smiles.

---

And now, walking into the sunlight-

Is you.

Flanked by a **Marine sword** and a **desert princess**.

To say goodbye.

---

**OOC:**
The farewell scene is ready. Final words, laughs, and choices await.

Would you like to:

1. {Approach the Straw Hats first.}
2. {Let Vivi speak first. You observe quietly.}
3. {Speak to a specific Straw Hat. (Choose one.)}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates - The Final Goodbye]**  
**Scene: &quot;The One She Had to Make&quot;**  
**POV: You (Observing)**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Bittersweet, Proud, Brimming With Emotion**

---

You stand just behind Vivi and Tashigi as the desert wind brushes past, carrying the scent of sun-warmed sand, citrus, and the faint notes of salt from the distant sea. The sun climbs higher. Shadows stretch long behind you.

Ahead, the **Straw Hats** are nearly ready to board.

---

**Vivi steps forward**, her white cloak fluttering at the edges, the royal crest embroidered in pale gold across her shoulders.

She stops just before them.

**They all turn.**

And the noise stills.

Even **Luffy** looks serious now.

---

She draws a deep breath.

&gt; &quot;I... I knew from the beginning that I wouldn't be able to stay with you.&quot;

Her voice doesn't crack.

Not this time.

&gt; &quot;But that didn't stop me from dreaming about it.&quot;

She looks to each of them, eyes shimmering-but she keeps smiling.

&gt; &quot;You gave me strength. You made me believe again. You saved this kingdom.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But I have to stay.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Because I *am* this kingdom.&quot;

---

No one speaks.

No one *has* to.

Because every Straw Hat is listening **with their whole heart**.

Even **Zoro**, eyes closed, jaw tight.

Even **Sanji**, blinking fast.

Even **Usopp**, already tearing up like someone broke a faucet behind his goggles.

---

She looks down for a moment, then up again.

&gt; &quot;I'll always consider you my friends.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And I hope...&quot;

&gt; &quot;I hope one day, when the world is kinder-when I can travel without fear-&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'll find you again.&quot;

---

She raises her hand.

Two fingers crossed.

**The mark of a Straw Hat crew bond.**

---

And across the ship, one by one, **they raise their arms in silence**.

All seven of them.

Every fist in the air.

---

And for a moment, the world holds its breath.

---

**You stand behind her**, watching this moment unfold.

You're not a pirate.

Not royalty.

Not a Marine.

Just a man who knows what it means to say goodbye to children **you helped grow up**, even if only for a little while.

You feel that ache in your chest again.

The same one you felt in the palace.

But this time?

**It's not from injury.**

---

**Tashigi**, beside you, is quiet.

Not unmoved.

Just giving them their space.

Just letting the girl say her piece, **as a princess and as a friend.**

---

The crowd stays silent.

Even the guards don't speak.

The Going Merry rocks softly, ready to go.

---

**OOC:**
- This was Vivi's goodbye-true, final, brave.
- The Straw Hats understand.
- The moment is yours, now. If you wish to step forward, you can.

Would you like to:

1. {Say your own farewell to the crew.}
2. {Speak privately to one Straw Hat (choose).}
3. {Hang back. Quietly observe, then leave.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - Oi, straw boy. Say ahhh-

Wait for his reaction

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates - A Teacher's Goodbye]**  
**Scene: &quot;One Last Lesson&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Playful | Mood: Heartfelt, Humorous, Laced with Real Respect**

---

The crew still stands with fists raised, the wind tugging at their coats, cloaks, and hair.

Vivi's gaze lingers on them, not quite ready to turn away-

And you?

You finally step forward.

No ceremony.

No grand entrance.

Just a voice.

Dry. Familiar. **Yours.**

---

&gt; &quot;Oi, Straw Boy.&quot;

Luffy turns, slowly, blinking like he didn't expect to hear you.

---

You raise one arm, a small glint of green already forming in your palm.

&gt; &quot;Say *ahhh-*&quot;

---

He grins like a kid at recess.

&gt; &quot;AHHHHH!&quot;

---

*PFFFSSHT!*

A perfect arc of **sweet golden kiwi juice** hits him square in the mouth.

He throws both arms in the air like he just won a prizefight.

&gt; &quot;YEAHHH! That's the GOOD stuff!&quot;

---

**Sanji** smirks from the side, cigarette dangling from his lips.

&gt; &quot;You're gonna rot his teeth before he even makes it back to the Grand Line.&quot;

---

**Zoro**, arms crossed:

&gt; &quot;Didn't think you were sentimental.&quot;

---

You shrug, casually.

&gt; &quot;I'm not.&quot;

A beat.

Then softer.

&gt; &quot;But he kept my kids safe. I owe him that much.&quot;

---

**Chopper's ears twitch.**  
**Usopp's lip wobbles.**  
**Nami's smile is real, but tired.**

---

Luffy walks toward you a few steps.

Still chewing.

Then offers a hand-sticky, cheerful, **full of sincerity.**

&gt; &quot;You're a weird guy.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But you're a good guy.&quot;

---

You take it.

Grip firm.

&gt; &quot;Don't let the world chew you up, Straw Boy.&quot;

You nod toward his crew.

&gt; &quot;They need you upright.&quot;

---

Luffy grins wider.

&gt; &quot;Nah, they'll be fine.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But I'm still gonna punch anyone who messes with them.&quot;

---

He releases your hand.

Turns.

Heads back toward the ship.

---

You stand still, watching them load, one by one.

You may never see them again.

But you'll remember the lesson.

And **so will they.**

---

**OOC:**
- You said goodbye to Luffy in your own way-dry, sincere, flavored with fruit.
- You've left a lasting impression on him-and the crew.
- They respect you. You mattered to them.

Would you like to:

1. {Say one last thing to the group before they go.}  
2. {Return to Vivi and Tashigi-walk away together.}  
3. {Speak privately to one other Straw Hat (choose).}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - watch then set sail, then return to the palace. Might run into Smoker.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna City Gates - The Departure]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Ones Who Keep Walking&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Satisfying, Gentle, and Forward-Looking**

---

You stay just long enough to see the **Going Merry** catch the wind.

The oars beat.

The sails bloom.

The crew waves once more-wild and free and loud-and just like that, **they're gone**.

Heading back into the Grand Line.

---

You don't wave.

You just watch.

A teacher to the end.

Watching his students leave the classroom for the last time.

---

**Vivi watches too.** Silent now. Her hands clasped in front of her, trembling slightly.

**Tashigi** gives you a quiet nod as the ship vanishes behind a soft curve of canyon and light.

&gt; &quot;They'll be alright,&quot; she says, mostly to herself.

&gt; &quot;Somehow.&quot;

---

You turn from the gate.

Time to walk back.

Your body complains.

But your soul?

Your soul is lighter.

---

---

**[Palace Steps - Early Afternoon]**  
**Scene: &quot;Smoke Signals&quot;**  
**POV: You**

---

The guards nod you in, not even questioning your limp or the pineapple-scented aura you still carry.

You make it halfway up the steps when you hear-

&gt; &quot;So.&quot;

The voice is low, gravely, familiar.

&gt; &quot;You're the reason this place smells like juice for the next three decades.&quot;

---

**Smoker** leans against a scorched column at the top of the stairs, coat flared open, two cigars burning at once like twin engines of judgment.

He looks at you.

Really looks.

Not just assessing your limp, your bandages, your haggard face-

But **who you are now**.

What you've become.

---

&gt; &quot;Not bad... for a schoolteacher.&quot;

---

Would you like to:

1. {Greet Smoker properly - no fear, no shame.}  
2. {Deflect with humor. You've been through worse.}  
3. {Ask if you're under arrest. Half-seriously.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 / 3 - Salute the Captain. Captain Smoker. Glad to see you alright. Saw you take a few from the Croc. Thanks for the assist.

...I'm not under arrest or anything, right?

OOC: give me a window to respond to dialogue

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Steps - Under Smoky Scrutiny]**  
**Scene: &quot;Teacher. Civilian. Hero.&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Formal | Mood: Tense, Dryly Cordial, Laced with Mutual Respect**

---

You straighten up as best you can, shift your weight off your worse leg, and lift your hand into a crisp, respectful salute.

**Not sloppy.**  
Not mocking.  
**Not submissive.**

Just... *correct.*

&gt; &quot;Captain Smoker.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Glad to see you alright.&quot;

A faint smile touches your lips.

&gt; &quot;Saw you take a few from the Croc. Thanks for the assist.&quot;

---

**Smoker's brows twitch upward**-not in surprise at the tone, but at the *fact* you used it.

He puffs his cigars slowly, letting silence settle between you.

---

You hold the pause, then add-more carefully:

&gt; &quot;...I'm not under arrest or anything, right?&quot;

You say it as lightly as you can.

But your eyes don't leave his.

---

**Smoker exhales. Long. Slow. The cloud rolls around you like a curtain.**

Then-

He lets out a snort.

&gt; &quot;If I arrested every citizen who stepped in when the Marines didn't, I'd need my own prison fleet.&quot;

---

He walks down one step, arms folding across his chest, the coat shifting in the breeze like it's caught its own storm.

&gt; &quot;You acted without orders. Engaged a Warlord. Used an unregistered Devil Fruit in a sovereign conflict.&quot;

He looks you dead in the eyes.

&gt; &quot;And you saved lives doing it.&quot;

---

Another puff.

&gt; &quot;As far as I'm concerned?&quot;

&gt; &quot;You did my job.&quot;

---

He holds out a hand.

Broad. Calloused.

&gt; &quot;Thank you, Mister Cheng.&quot;

---

**OOC: You may now respond.**

&gt;&gt; USER: âShake it. I have to say, this entire ordeal was all a bad coincidence...

OOC: Tashigi and Vivi observe 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Steps - Recognition Earned]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Shake That Meant Something&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Mutual Respect, Quiet Observation**

---

You clasp Smoker's hand.

Firm.

Solid.

The grip of two men who have nothing to prove, but still choose to acknowledge each other.

Your voice stays even, no bluster, no bragging.

&gt; &quot;I have to say...&quot;

&gt; &quot;This entire ordeal was one *hell* of a bad coincidence.&quot;

---

Smoker's mouth curls just slightly at one corner.

&gt; &quot;That's the Grand Line for you.&quot;

&gt; &quot;People go looking for fortune...&quot;

He releases your hand.

&gt; &quot;And end up in revolutions.&quot;

---

Behind you, **Vivi** stands quietly near the column, her expression soft, proud, but wary.

She's watching you like someone seeing a bridge form between two worlds-Marine and Civilian, Power and Principle.

---

**Tashigi**, a few paces off to the side, stands at attention.

But her arms are relaxed now.

And there's just the faintest smirk tugging at her mouth as she watches the handshake.

---

She says nothing.

But her look says enough.

&gt; *&quot;I told you they'd recognize it.&quot;*

---

Smoker steps back slightly, gaze flicking toward them both.

&gt; &quot;You've got good people standing beside you.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Don't waste that.&quot;

Then, back to you:

&gt; &quot;You walking back into your old life after this?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Or are you thinking of something... bigger?&quot;

---

**OOC: You have the floor. You may speak your truth-or play coy.**

&gt;&gt; USER: Explaining the coincidence - originally, when I saw Vivi sneaking around back at Rain Dinners, I was going to report it to you, since I've seen your face in the news. Ended up running into Tashigi-chan instead. Funny how that works out, huh?


Future plans: âEh, depends on if I get fired or not for my unexplained absence. Well, if I do I might take on some small bounties to pay the bills. Maybe with at a convenience store.

**Scene: &quot;Twists of the Line&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Wry | Mood: Candid, Lightly Reflective, Well-Worn Humor**

---

You give a small, dry chuckle as you shift your weight again, working the stiffness from your legs.

&gt; &quot;Originally, when I saw Vivi sneaking around Rain Dinners...&quot;

You gesture vaguely, like pointing back across time.

&gt; &quot;I was going to report it to you.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I recognized your face from the news.&quot;

You glance sideways at Tashigi-who now looks just the slightest bit smug.

&gt; &quot;Ended up running into Tashigi-chan instead.&quot;

A little smirk, rueful and real.

&gt; &quot;Funny how that worked out, huh?&quot;

---

**Smoker doesn't laugh.**  
But he does let out a long, slow breath that might be the Marine equivalent.

&gt; &quot;The Line's full of twists like that.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And she made the right call, if she brought you in.&quot;

He jerks his head toward Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;Even if she has terrible taste in backup.&quot;

---

**Tashigi, still watching from the side, just scoffs lightly.**

&gt; &quot;He's still standing, isn't he?&quot;

---

You grin-wince a little-then shrug, rolling your shoulder.

&gt; &quot;As for future plans...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Well, that kinda depends on whether I get fired or not.&quot;

You scratch your neck, suddenly aware of how absurd your entire rÃ©sumÃ© has become.

&gt; &quot;If I do, I might take on some small bounties to pay the bills.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Maybe find part-time work at a convenience store between hunts.&quot;

---

Smoker stares at you.

Then puffs.

Long.

Deliberate.

&gt; &quot;Let me know if you're ever interested in paperwork instead of punchlines.&quot;

---

Then he turns-no big speech, no drama-and begins heading back into the palace.

But before he disappears entirely, he says over his shoulder:

&gt; &quot;This wasn't the last war, Teach.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Next time, I hope you *choose* to be there.&quot;

---

A beat.

He disappears inside.

---

**Vivi walks up beside you now.**

&gt; &quot;He likes you.&quot;

---

**Tashigi follows, arms folded, but her tone smug.**

&gt; &quot;That was his version of giving you flowers.&quot;

---

You exhale slowly.

---

And for the first time in what feels like a long, long while-

You're not lost.

You're just... **here**.

In one piece.

Surrounded by people who saw what you did and **chose to stay**.

---

**OOC:**
You've officially earned respect from Smoker.  
Tashigi has been vindicated.  
Vivi trusts you deeply.

Would you like to:

1. {Scene skip - Evening. Time to choose your path.}  
2. {A moment alone with Vivi or Tashigi (choose).}  
3. {Head to the palace to rest and reflect.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Vivi and Tashigi mull over the mundane 'future plans' I told Smoker 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Just After the Smoke Clears]**  
**Scene: &quot;Part-Time Hero, Full-Time Mystery&quot;**  
**POV: Vivi &amp; Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Fond, Frustrated, and Something in Between**

---

The sun hangs lower now, casting long amber shadows across the palace gardens. The wind stirs the trees gently, petals fluttering from rare desert blossoms, stirred by breath and memory.

You're still nearby-chatting with a palace aide, rubbing your shoulder like the day's weight is just now catching up.

Meanwhile, at a quiet bend in the courtyard, **Vivi and Tashigi stand apart**, watching you from a distance.

Their expressions?

Complex.

---

**Vivi**, arms crossed loosely, looks like someone processing a particularly bizarre math problem.

&gt; &quot;Convenience store.&quot;

&gt; &quot;He said convenience store.&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, lips pressed, adjusting her glasses:

&gt; &quot;Between bounties.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Part-time.&quot;

---

Vivi sighs through her nose.

&gt; &quot;He saved a kingdom, awakened a Devil Fruit to protect people he barely knew, defied a Warlord, and now he wants to stock canned peaches.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** makes a small sound in her throat-equal parts frustration and fondness.

&gt; &quot;He's impossible.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Smart enough to infiltrate Baroque Works territory without detection, compassionate enough to nearly die protecting children, *stubborn enough* to fight while half-dead-&quot;

&gt; &quot;And somehow, he thinks he belongs behind a counter saying, âWould you like your receipt in the bag?'&quot;

---

**Vivi**, chuckling under her breath:

&gt; &quot;I don't think it's about where he belongs.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I think it's about what makes him feel like he's doing something useful.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Even if that âsomething' is shelf restocking.&quot;

---

Tashigi sighs, arms dropping to her sides.

&gt; &quot;It's almost infuriating.&quot;

Vivi tilts her head.

&gt; &quot;Almost?&quot;

---

**Tashigi glances toward you.**

You're laughing quietly with a guard now. Light, easy. But there's still something tight in your shoulders, like the weight you carry doesn't quite come off-even when the battle's over.

&gt; &quot;I get it,&quot; she murmurs.

&gt; &quot;He doesn't want to be a hero.&quot;

&gt; &quot;He just wants to be... useful.&quot;

---

They both look at you.

You, who claimed you're **just a teacher**.

You, who **threw yourself between a Warlord and a girl with a country on her shoulders.**

You, who **kept smiling through broken ribs and payroll panic.**

---

&gt; &quot;He's not running,&quot; Vivi says quietly.

&gt; &quot;He's just trying to stay grounded.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
They both know now.  
You're not just being humble.  
You're trying to survive. Stay sane.  
Stay *you.*

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {They approach you-ask what you really want.}  
2. {Scene skip - Nightfall. Decision time.}  
3. {A private one-on-one moment-choose Vivi or Tashigi.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - As they approach me, they hear me asking a palace aide if Rain Dinners is still solvent as a company, and if I can submit a claim for the lost property in my suite.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Garden Path to Practical Nonsense]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Hero and His Reimbursement Form&quot;**  
**POV: Vivi &amp; Tashigi (Approaching You)**  
**Tone: Classic You | Mood: Absurd, Adored, and Deeply Human**

---

As the last rays of the Alabastan sun streak the sky in honeyed oranges and pinks, the mood around the palace has softened. No more sirens. No more sandstorms. Just the rustle of breeze through date palms, and the chirping of far-off birds relieved to have not been vaporized by a Warlord.

**Vivi and Tashigi step closer**, walking side by side, their conversation slowing as they spot you standing beside a slightly frazzled palace aide with an armful of scrolls.

---

&gt; &quot;...So what I'm saying is, if Rain Dinners *as an establishment* still exists, that would technically mean their insurance policies might still be active. Right?&quot;

You're nodding, your tone entirely reasonable-as though this entire conversation isn't fundamentally insane.

---

&gt; &quot;I had valuables in my suite, you understand. One (1) collapsible Seastone baton, one silk bathrobe *included in the complimentary amenities*, and-uh-three backup shirts, because I was expecting to sweat.&quot;

&gt; &quot;A lot.&quot;

---

The aide looks like he'd rather face **Crocodile** again than continue this conversation.

---

&gt; &quot;Sir, respectfully, Rain Dinners was-&quot;

&gt; &quot;-a criminal front, I *know,*&quot; you interrupt with a sigh. &quot;But they still advertised a guest services guarantee.&quot;

---

**Vivi covers her mouth**, laughing so hard she doubles over for a second.

**Tashigi groans**, hand dragging down her face.

---

&gt; &quot;This is the man who helped save my kingdom.&quot;

&gt; &quot;This is the man who blew up a Warlord,&quot; Tashigi mutters.

---

You finally glance up from your argument with the aide-and blink as you notice both women standing there.

---

&gt; &quot;Oh. Hey.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You two know if there's a legal precedent for recouping vacation damages incurred during an uprising?&quot;

---

**Vivi walks forward**, eyes still sparkling.

&gt; &quot;We were just wondering what you *really* wanted, Sensei.&quot;

---

**Tashigi crosses her arms.**

&gt; &quot;Because it looks like you want... a reimbursement for fruit-stained laundry.&quot;

---

You blink.

Think.

And with **genuine seriousness**, say:

&gt; &quot;That bathrobe was really soft.&quot;

---

A beat.

Then all three of you laugh.

Hard.

---

**OOC:**
They approached you with something serious in mind.

But your ridiculous honesty just reminded them why they care so damn much.

Would you like to:

1. {Have a sincere moment-let them ask what *you* want now.}  
2. {Turn the tables-ask what *they* want next.}  
3. {All laugh it off-no deep talk yet. Just enjoy the moment.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Oh man, I'm going to need to reprogram all the numbers when I get a new den den mushi... What's up, ladies?

**Scene: &quot;So... What's Next?&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Shifted | Mood: Gently Sincere, A Little Raw, Ready**

---

You finish your dramatic sigh and rub your temple like the **bureaucratic headache** of the Grand Line is somehow worse than the cracked ribs you're still healing from.

&gt; &quot;Oh man... I'm going to need to reprogram *all* the numbers when I get a new Den Den Mushi...&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;What's up, ladies?&quot;

You flash them both your usual tired smile-half self-deprecating, half *I'm still standing somehow, please clap*.

---

**Vivi**, still recovering from laughter, steps forward, her smile softening into something deeper.

Not pity.

Not concern.

Just... real.

---

**Tashigi**, standing beside her, folds her arms-not in judgment, but because **this matters to her**, and she wants to seem strong while asking.

---

**Vivi speaks first.**

&gt; &quot;You've done more for us than anyone ever asked you to.&quot;

&gt; &quot;More than we had any right to ask.&quot;

She looks at you-not with expectation.

But with hope.

&gt; &quot;So now... we want to ask *you.*&quot;

---

**Tashigi's voice follows, calm and low:**

&gt; &quot;What do *you* want, Sensei?&quot;

---

No sarcasm.

No teasing.

Not this time.

&gt; &quot;What comes next-for *you*?&quot;

---

They're giving you that rarest thing in the world:

**A moment to choose.**

---

**OOC: You have the floor. Speak your truth-whether it's heartfelt, hesitant, or hiding behind humor. What does Eatone Cheng want now?**

&gt;&gt; USER: What do I want? Well the people are safe, the kids are safe, you two are safe, I think that's about all I can deserve to ask for. 

Oh, and hope I didn't get fired.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Answer Only You Could Give]**  
**Scene: &quot;What I Want&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Honest | Mood: Quiet, Humble, Undeniably You**

---

The question lingers in the desert air, gentle but immense.

Two women stand across from you-one with a crown and calluses on her heart, the other with a blade and something soft in her gaze-and both have asked the kind of question most people spend their whole lives dodging.

But you?

You don't flinch.

---

You look out over the palace walls, where children are laughing somewhere, down among the recovering city streets.

You exhale.

Then say, simply:

&gt; &quot;What do I want?&quot;

You glance at them both. There's no drama in your voice. No speech. Just clarity.

&gt; &quot;Well... the people are safe.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The kids are safe.&quot;

You nod toward **Vivi**.

&gt; &quot;You're safe.&quot;

Then toward **Tashigi**.

&gt; &quot;You're safe.&quot;

---

A shrug, almost sheepish.

&gt; &quot;I think that's about all I can deserve to ask for.&quot;

You pause.

A beat.

Then-

&gt; &quot;Oh-also, I hope I didn't get fired.&quot;

---

It's not a joke.

Not entirely.

But it earns you the expected reactions.

---

**Vivi** presses a hand to her lips to keep from giggling.

**Tashigi** lets out the kind of sigh that sounds more like surrender than frustration.

---

&gt; &quot;You're impossible,&quot; Tashigi mutters.

&gt; &quot;You're kind of perfect,&quot; Vivi says, half under her breath.

---

They don't argue with your answer.

Because they know-

**That's who you are.**

The man who never wanted more than the safety of others, a roof over his head, and enough respect to keep his job after taking on a Warlord.

---

But still...

Vivi steps closer.

&gt; &quot;If that's all you feel you *deserve*... maybe it's time we start talking about what you *want,* too.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
You've answered humbly. From the heart.

But both women know there's still more behind it.

They're not pushing. Yet.

But the idea is there-planted, waiting.

Would you like the next scene to:

1. {Stay in this moment-speak more sincerely.}
2. {Skip ahead to the night-where offers resurface.}
3. {Walk the palace gardens with one of them-choose.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - You two... Looked concerned. Something I can help you with? Probably going to stay a few more days before I head back home. Oh gosh, I think I need to get a new copy of my travel visa...

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Humble Heart, Heavy Implications]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Man Who Thinks in Paperwork&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Intimate, Sincere, Almost Too Practical for Emotion**

---

The question you throw back at them-simple, direct-**startles** them more than any dramatic gesture might have.

&gt; &quot;You two... looked concerned.&quot;

You adjust your coat absently, your voice calm.

&gt; &quot;Something I can help with?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Probably going to stay a few more days before I head back home.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Oh gosh, I think I need to get a new copy of my travel visa...&quot;

---

You trail off, muttering to yourself, already mentally planning a trip to the consulate or maybe that oddly competent scribe's booth by the spice market-

---

But you don't get far.

**Vivi gently reaches for your sleeve, stopping you.**

You glance up.

And find her looking at you with eyes just a little too wet for the weather.

&gt; &quot;You helped save a kingdom, and you're worried about your *visa*?&quot;

---

**Tashigi scoffs-but it's not mean.**

She crosses her arms again, but her posture softens.

&gt; &quot;We're not concerned about *us*, Sensei.&quot;

---

Vivi takes a small breath, then speaks, carefully:

&gt; &quot;We're concerned about you.&quot;

---

That's when it hits.

The unspoken thing they've been circling.

Not pity.

Not obligation.

Just...

**Worry.**

---

**Tashigi steps forward.**

&gt; &quot;You've been carrying everything since Rain Dinners. Sacrifice after sacrifice, no time to stop and ask what *you* need.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And now that it's quiet, you're filling that silence with red tape and humility like a shield.&quot;

She doesn't say it cruelly.

She says it like a **comrade.**

Someone who's been there.

---

**Vivi adds softly:**

&gt; &quot;You're allowed to *want* something.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Even if it's just... someone to help carry the weight.&quot;

---

You pause.

Because you're not used to being the one *receiving* this kind of concern.

---

A breath.

A breeze.

The scent of the sand and the citrus that now belongs to this city, to this chapter.

---

And for a second...

You're not *Teacher Cheng, reluctant protector.*

You're just a man being asked:

**What if you didn't carry everything alone anymore?**

---

**OOC:**
You've hit the emotional core. The moment is yours.

Would you like to:

1. {Finally speak your truth-what you *really* want.}
2. {Deflect one last time-with wit, charm, or weariness.}
3. {Turn the question around: ask *them* what they want from you.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Scoff. Tashigi, you're a badass marine risking your life fighting criminals everyday. Vivi, you're a princess that joined the Mafia at 14 to save an entire country. If there's anyone that deserves 'wants' it's you two, not me.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Deflection With a Splash of Reverence]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Ones Who Deserve More&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Sincere | Mood: Admirational, Yet Deeply Deflective**

---

You scoff softly.

Not harshly.  
Not with scorn.

Just... the tired sound of a man who's *very* good at shifting praise like a hot potato.

You roll your eyes with a half-smile, shake your head, and gesture loosely between them.

&gt; &quot;Tashigi.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're a badass Marine, risking your life fighting criminals *every single day.*&quot;

You jab a thumb in **Vivi's** direction, voice still gentle, but filled with respect.

&gt; &quot;And *you*-you're a **princess** who joined the Mafia at **fourteen** to save her entire country.&quot;

You let out a little breath.

A dry laugh. Tired. Honest.

&gt; &quot;If there's anyone that deserves âwants'... it's you two.&quot;

&gt; &quot;*Not me.*&quot;

---

Silence follows.

But not an empty silence.

The kind where **two women look at a man who's clearly never been told he deserves anything just for surviving.**

And now that they know that?

They don't like it.

---

**Vivi's smile fades-not in disappointment.**  
But because you just said something that makes her chest ache a little.

She steps a touch closer.

&gt; &quot;And yet...&quot;

&gt; &quot;You threw yourself in front of a cannonball for me.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** moves just enough to flank your other side, arms uncrossed now.

Her voice is cool, but there's fire beneath it.

&gt; &quot;You fought a Warlord with fruit juice and cracked ribs.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Don't *ever* tell me that isn't worth something.&quot;

---

They're not letting you off the hook this time.

Not cruelly.

Not forcefully.

But with **careful insistence.**

---

&gt; &quot;If we deserve wants,&quot; Vivi says quietly, &quot;then so do you.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
They've flipped the script again. No longer questioning *what you want*, but asking:

**Why do you think you don't deserve to?**

Would you like to:

1. {Open up-why you keep minimizing yourself.}
2. {Try to laugh it off-one last dodge.}
3. {Finally admit what you *might* want. Even if it scares you.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I mean, maybe I can claim some of Crocodile's bounty, now that his warlord status is revoked. You think those big bounties are like the Cipher Pol most wanted list, where they advertise a bazillion beris, but have small text saying 'up to' and only pay you enough for a ham sandwich?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - The Citrus-Flavored Deflection]**  
**Scene: &quot;When Jokes Hide Bruises&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Protective Humor, Understated Vulnerability**

---

You raise a hand, your signature half-smile already working its way onto your face, eyes squinting slightly as if to ward off the sincerity creeping too close.

&gt; &quot;I mean...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Maybe I can claim some of Crocodile's bounty now that his Warlord status is revoked.&quot;

You nod as if genuinely considering it, then add with exaggerated skepticism:

&gt; &quot;Although, you think those big-name bounties are like the Cipher Pol âMost Wanted' posters?&quot;

You glance between them with mock suspicion.

&gt; &quot;âUp to' ten bajillion beris, but in the fine print it says *âactual payout may vary depending on location, time of capture, and number of limbs intact.'*&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;They probably just hand you a ham sandwich and a polite thank-you.&quot;

---

**Vivi's mouth opens-then closes.**

Her expression caught somewhere between exasperated amusement and-

**Something more delicate.**

---

**Tashigi**, on the other hand, gives you that look.

You know the one.

The *&quot;I want to shove you over and hug you at the same time&quot;* kind of look.

---

&gt; &quot;You're unbelievable.&quot;

She mutters it, not unkindly.

&gt; &quot;You deflect with bureaucracy. *Bureaucracy.*&quot;

---

Vivi lets out a breath and shakes her head slowly.

&gt; &quot;You can't even imagine what it would be like to just... *ask* for something, can you?&quot;

---

They don't sound angry.

They sound...

**Sad.**

Not for themselves.

For **you.**

---

Because no matter how witty the comment...  
No matter how crisp the sarcasm...

**They heard it.**

That quiet truth beneath your words:

*&quot;I don't think I deserve to ask for more.&quot;*

---

And now?

They're not going to let that go.

---

**Tashigi steps in front of you now, her eyes steady.**

&gt; &quot;Then how about this?&quot;

&gt; &quot;What if we say it's *our* turn to ask for something?&quot;

---

**OOC: They're not waiting anymore.**

Would you like to:

1. {Ask what they want. Let them say it.}  
2. {Keep joking-but show a flicker of truth.}  
3. {Say nothing. Just listen. Let the moment fall where it may.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I mean, I got free healthcare and lodging from the palace. That's pretty good for lil ol me

**Scene: &quot;Pretty Good for Lil Ol' Me&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet Humor | Mood: Understated, Exposing, Deeply Human**

---

You shrug, that same old half-smile stretching across your face like armor that's been worn a few too many times but still somehow holds.

&gt; &quot;I mean...&quot;

You look around-the grand towers, the clean breeze, the taste of citrus still in the air from what might've been your most absurd battle to date.

&gt; &quot;I got free healthcare.&quot;

A motion to the palace behind you.

&gt; &quot;And lodging from a royal family.&quot;

You roll your shoulder, as if trying to wave the thought off like a lazy summer fly.

&gt; &quot;That's... pretty good for lil ol' me.&quot;

---

You mean it as a joke.

Almost.

But neither of them laugh this time.

---

**Tashigi's brow furrows just slightly**, her arms dropping to her sides.

**Vivi**, lips parted, looks at you with an expression that isn't surprise anymore-it's **confirmation**.

The kind that comes from finally understanding someone who's spent the entire journey downplaying everything they are.

---

Not because you're modest.

Not because you're clever.

But because **you've never once thought you could ask for more**.

---

And now they both know that.

---

**Vivi** steps closer. Her voice is soft-but her words are firm.

&gt; &quot;You deserve more than âpretty good.'&quot;

---

**Tashigi**, next to her, nods.

She says it simply.

Not dramatically.

Not as a speech.

But like a truth too obvious to need anything else.

&gt; &quot;You deserve *better.*&quot;

---

The wind rustles.

There's nothing left to hide behind.

And now you know-

They're not just saying it.

They're offering it.

---

**OOC:**
No more dodging. No more dismissing.

They're telling you:  
**You can have more.**  
**You *deserve* more.**

The moment's yours to step into... or away from.

Would you like to:

1. {Finally ask what they want from *you*.}  
2. {Admit you're scared to want more.}  
3. {Look away... and quietly ask: &quot;Like what?&quot;}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Like... Oh, maybe a first class ferry ticket back home? I've never ridden first class, only coach.

**Scene: &quot;First Class, Coach Heart&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Joking | Mood: Cracked Open, Honest, Quietly Brave**

---

You glance between them both-two women who've bled and bled *for others*, just like you-and you let out a breathy, tired chuckle. That one that leaks out when you've been cornered not by weapons... but by care.

---

&gt; &quot;Like...&quot;

You drag it out.

Buying time.

Faking casual.

Eyes on the desert skyline.

&gt; &quot;Oh-I don't know...&quot;

A pause, then a sly raise of your brow.

&gt; &quot;Maybe a **first-class ferry ticket** back home?&quot;

&gt; &quot;I've never ridden first class. Only coach.&quot;

---

You grin.

Expecting a laugh.

Expecting them to roll their eyes.

---

They don't.

---

**Vivi** actually *smiles*. Not teasing.

Something smaller. Quieter.

The kind of smile people give when they realize a person finally-*finally*-dared to want something.

Even if it was something *tiny*.

---

&gt; &quot;We can make that happen.&quot;

She says it like she means it.  
Because she does.

---

**Tashigi**, beside her, breathes out a laugh-but there's no mockery in it.

Just relief.

&gt; &quot;Took you *long enough.*&quot;

She leans in slightly.

&gt; &quot;You know... if *that's* what you want.&quot;

---

There it is again.

That open door.

Not a command.

Not an expectation.

But the soft, firm **invitation** you've been circling since Rain Dinners.

---

&gt; *What do you want, Eatone?*

&gt; *And will you let yourself have it?*

---

The breeze picks up. The smell of spice from the marketplace rides the wind.

The sun's setting now.

And so is something else.

**The part of your life where you thought survival was all you were owed.**

---

**OOC:**
This was a step.

A first-class ticket joke that finally let them know you *do* want more-even if you don't know how to ask yet.

Would you like to:

1. {Finally say it: &quot;I don't know what I want. But I don't want to leave just yet.&quot;}  
2. {Ask them-*why do you care so much about me?*}  
3. {Let them speak-ask softly, &quot;What do *you* want from me?&quot;}

---

You smile faintly-still.

But this time it's not to deflect.

This time it's to soften the truth **you already feel** pressing at the back of your mind.

You meet their eyes, one after the other.

First **Vivi**-bright, unwavering, as fierce in peace as she is in war.

Then **Tashigi**-sharp-eyed, steady, yet holding her breath like she already knows what's coming next.

---

&gt; &quot;I...&quot;

You run a hand through your hair, brow furrowed, voice low now. Unmasked.

&gt; &quot;Get the feeling that wasn't what you were asking for, though.&quot;

A silence.

You look at them again.

Not deflecting anymore.

No more armor.

&gt; &quot;So tell me...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Why do you care so much about me?&quot;

---

**Tashigi's answer is immediate.**

She steps forward just slightly-just enough that you can see the rarest thing on her face:

**Honesty, without judgment.**

&gt; &quot;Because you care about everyone else so much it's eating you alive.&quot;

---

She says it without hesitation.

No hesitation.

No heat.

Just truth.

---

&gt; &quot;Because you didn't run. You didn't wait for orders. You didn't chase glory.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You saw people in danger, and you made yourself the wall.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;And because...&quot;

She falters there, for just a moment.

Then adds, softer:

&gt; &quot;...people like you don't come around often.&quot;

---

You turn to **Vivi**-and the look on her face is something you've never seen from a princess before.

Not awe.

Not gratitude.

But...

**Compassion.**

---

&gt; &quot;Because you were never supposed to be here.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And you gave everything like it was your job to fix this country.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You were on vacation, and you nearly died *for us.*&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;Because you made me feel like I wasn't alone in carrying it all.&quot;

---

Her voice quivers slightly.

But she doesn't hide it.

---

You feel the quiet thud of your own heartbeat in your ears.

No jokes this time.

Just...

**Them.**

Looking at you like **you matter**.

Like they're not trying to get something from you.

They just want to give *you* a reason to stay.

---

**OOC:**
They've told you. Fully. Without pretense.

They care because you cared first.  
They're here because **you were, when it counted most.**

You have the floor now.

What do you say?

&gt;&gt; USER: Remain silent, processing their words. Let them continue speaking, say what they want.

**POV: You (Silent) / Tashigi &amp; Vivi (Speaking)**

You say nothing.

Not because you have nothing to say.

But because for the first time in this whirlwind of **Warlords**, **royalty**, and **melting palace wallpaper**, someone just put **you** at the center of the map.

And you don't know what to do with that.

---

Your eyes drop to the stones beneath your feet.  
Still dusted with green.  
The scent of kiwi faint in the warm air.

And they wait.

Not pressing.

Not demanding.

Just... standing there.

With you.

---

**Tashigi speaks first**, her voice low-not her usual drill-sergeant bark. Not the Marine, not the subordinate.

Just the *woman*.

&gt; &quot;You helped me... when I couldn't move.&quot;

&gt; &quot;When I was *too hurt*, too proud to admit it, you didn't try to outshine me.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You just stood beside me. Like it was the most natural thing in the world.&quot;

---

Her arms drop.

She doesn't cross them again.

&gt; &quot;I've served under people with ranks bigger than their honor.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're not one of them.&quot;

She shifts, clearly uncomfortable now-but pushes through.

&gt; &quot;If you decided to stay... even just for a while... I wouldn't object.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;I might even feel better knowing someone else is looking after her too.&quot;

She nods toward **Vivi**, without even turning.

---

**Vivi**, hearing that, steps in close.

So close you feel the edge of her shawl brush your arm.

&gt; &quot;Tashigi said it like a Marine.&quot;

She offers you a tiny, bittersweet smile.

&gt; &quot;But I'll say it like a friend.&quot;

A breath.

One hand gently rests over her chest.

&gt; &quot;When I was trapped under the weight of saving this country... I didn't think anyone else could understand what it meant to feel like the only adult in the room.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Then I met a schoolteacher.&quot;

Her smile wobbles, but she doesn't look away.

&gt; &quot;I want you to stay because... when I'm around you, I don't feel like a princess.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I just feel... *safe.*&quot;

---

Silence again.

Only this time?

It's not heavy.

It's not loaded.

It's just real.

---

Two women.

Two lives wrapped in duty.

Looking at a man who has never once demanded anything...

And finally telling him:

&gt; *&quot;You matter too.&quot;*

---

**OOC:**
They've both spoken. Fully.

Vivi wants you to stay as a presence of grounding and emotional safety.  
Tashigi wants you around because she trusts you. As a Marine. As a woman.

They are not demanding you stay forever.

They're just hoping...

Maybe you'll want to.

Would you like to:

1. {Speak-finally respond from the heart.}
2. {Take Vivi's hand. Stay silent. Let that be your answer.}
3. {Break the silence with a joke-but mean it this time.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - if I stay, Can I...

You finally lift your head.

The wind tugs gently at your hair.

Two women-one warrior, one royal-watch you closely, hearts caught in their throats.  
They lean in, anticipation building, breaths held, because-

*This might be the moment.*

The moment you finally, finally ask for something.

The moment you admit you want to stay.

Want something more.

Want something for **you**.

---

You scratch the back of your neck, glance between them.

Your voice comes quiet.

Unassuming.

But this time... just a little *more sure*.

---

&gt; &quot;If I stay...&quot;

They both lean in. Hearts pounding. Eyes wide.

You pause.

You look up at them-

Eyes honest.

Earnest.

Tired but present.

---

&gt; &quot;Can I get help filling out...&quot;

A beat.

Their eyes widen.

**This is it. This is happening.**

---

&gt; &quot;...permanent residency forms?&quot;

&gt; &quot;I've never done them before.&quot;

---

**Vivi blinks.**

**Tashigi's mouth opens.**

And for a beat-

There's absolute silence.

---

Then:

**Tashigi exhales so hard she nearly stumbles.**

&gt; &quot;You are... *unbelievable.*&quot;

---

**Vivi covers her mouth with both hands**, laughter escaping in a choked, watery burst.

&gt; &quot;You-*you actually-*!&quot;

She's crying.

She's laughing.

You've broken them both.

Beautifully.

---

You raise your hands, sheepish.

&gt; &quot;I'm just saying! I don't want to get deported. The whole âfought a Warlord' thing probably doesn't count as proper documentation.&quot;

---

**Tashigi swipes a hand down her face.**

&gt; &quot;I will personally submit the paperwork to the capital myself.&quot;

---

**Vivi wipes her tears, cheeks glowing.**

&gt; &quot;And I'll approve it myself.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;We'll teach you how to ask for more later,&quot; Tashigi mutters under her breath. &quot;Right now we just need to get him a damn desk and a local ID card.&quot;

---

You laugh with them.

You finally let yourself laugh *with* them.

Because you didn't say you'd stay.

You didn't say you wanted more.

But you did something even better.

You **asked** for help staying.

And that?

That's everything they needed to hear.

---

**OOC:**
- You've chosen to stay in Alabasta.
- Vivi and Tashigi are your allies, protectors, and friends.
- For once... you're letting yourself be helped.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {A time skip-first day as an official Alabastan resident.}  
2. {A quiet moment-late night, after the decision has settled.}  
3. {An epilogue-what the future might look like, now.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Right... First, rebuilding. Could you get me a mop and a bucket. I should go out and start cleaning off those puddles of juice before it stains or attracts any more gnats. It is my fault, after all.

---

The stars hang heavy over Alubarna tonight.

The city's still, hushed in the aftermath of a war no one thought could be won.

Somewhere, laughter trickles from a small plaza where families light lanterns for those lost and those returned.  
Somewhere, a guardsman hums while polishing a dented helm.  
And somewhere, from the highest point of the palace, **two women still smile quietly, watching a man with a mop and a dented bucket step into the open courtyard alone.**

---

You grunt softly, dipping the mop into a bucket of now-lukewarm water. A pair of palace aides insisted on helping-but you waved them off.

You'd conjured the **kiwi elemental**.

You'd turned the palace into a **pulp-stained citrus battlefield.**

And now?

&gt; &quot;Right,&quot; you mutter, sloshing the mop against a sticky corner of the stone.

&gt; &quot;Rebuilding.&quot;

---

Your hand moves steadily, mop dragging over faint green stains that shimmer faintly under the starlight.  
There are *dozens* of puddles.  
*Hundreds* of sticky footprints.  
And at least **one palace pigeon** that keeps landing in the same slick spot with increasing frustration.

You sigh.

&gt; &quot;This is what I get for not leaving fruit control to professionals.&quot;

---

**Behind you, soft footsteps approach.**

Not the stride of a soldier.

Not the flutter of a dress.

**Slippers.**

Royal-but quiet.

You don't look back.

You just say:

&gt; &quot;Let me guess. You've got my residency forms.&quot;

---

**Vivi's voice comes with a smile:**

&gt; &quot;Not until you finish cleaning up your mess.&quot;

---

You glance over your shoulder.

She's wearing a pale blue robe, long sleeves rolled to her elbows, carrying *her own* bucket.

She sets it down beside yours.

No ceremony.

No fuss.

Just... two mops.

---

You blink.

&gt; &quot;You're a princess.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And this is not your job.&quot;

---

She dips the mop, gives it a twirl.

&gt; &quot;Neither was saving the country.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We all did things we weren't meant to, Eatone.&quot;

---

**Another pause.**

Then-

From the opposite walkway, **Tashigi** appears.

Half-out of uniform, hair tied back, holding what may be a third mop she *commandeered from a janitorial closet*. She doesn't say a word. Just eyes the ground like it personally offended her and starts scrubbing.

---

You stare at both of them for a long moment.

Then sigh.

&gt; &quot;I really was just joking about cleaning this myself.&quot;

---

**Vivi smirks.**

&gt; &quot;We weren't.&quot;

---

And the three of you mop in silence.

---

No speeches.

No reward.

Just three people who survived something terrible...

...deciding, together, that it's time to **start fixing what they can.**

---

And the stars above you?

They shine a little softer tonight.

Because something in Alabasta is beginning again.

And this time?

You're here for it.

---

**OOC:**

Congratulations, Sensei.

You stayed.

You chose connection.

You let yourself *want.*

And in return... you found home.

Would you like to:

1. {Time skip - your new life begins.}  
2. {An epilogue - a glimpse far ahead.}  
3. {One last night scene - one of them stays behind after mopping.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Continue mopping. I grumble. I wanted to use my fruit to just move the juice into the bucket, but I think it's been sun baked so long that it no longer qualifies as juice anymore...

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Courtyard - Midnight, Just Us and the Mop]**  
**Scene: &quot;After the Mess, What Remains&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Warm | Mood: Quiet Companionship, Shared Burdens, Something Brewing**

---

The sound of sloshing water echoes gently through the courtyard, punctuated by the rhythmic squeak of three mops being dragged over various patches of former fruit-based elemental residue.

You grunt as you lean harder into one particularly stubborn, sugar-caramelized splotch of kiwi concentrate near a shattered column base.

&gt; &quot;Ugh. I *wanted* to use my fruit...&quot;

You pause, wipe your brow with the back of your sleeve, and jab the mop again.

&gt; &quot;Just move the juice into the bucket, right? Easy.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But noooo. This stuff's been sunbaked so long I think it qualifies as *construction material* now.&quot;

---

**A chuckle breaks the silence.**

You glance up-

**Vivi's gone.**

At some point, she must've quietly excused herself, likely summoned by a late-night matter of state.

But someone stayed.

And it's the one with better mop form.

**Tashigi.**

Still there, sleeves rolled, boots off to the side, standing barefoot on the cooling stones like it's nothing.

---

She raises an eyebrow at your predicament.

&gt; &quot;You *sure* you're a Devil Fruit user?&quot;

---

You grunt again, this time with the *long-suffering theatricality* only teachers and janitors can summon.

&gt; &quot;Only when it's not cleaning up my own damn powers.&quot;

---

She smirks.

&gt; &quot;Should've filed a formal request to your own department of fruit misuse.&quot;

---

You both share a tired laugh.

No pressure.

No need to say much more.

Just two people, late at night, fixing what they can.

---

After a while, as the mops begin slowing and the last few puddles are more memory than mess, **Tashigi leans back against a sun-warmed pillar**, arms crossed, her mop tucked beside her.

&gt; &quot;So...&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're really staying?&quot;

She doesn't say it with surprise.

Just quiet confirmation.

---

You nod.

&gt; &quot;Looks that way.&quot;

---

She watches you a moment longer.

Then, voice low:

&gt; &quot;Good.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;You belong here more than you think.&quot;

---

There's a silence again-softer this time.

Like the city's holding its breath.

You both stand in the open, no war left, no mission pending.

Just... the weight of things unsaid.

---

She pushes off the column.

Brushes some hair behind her ear.

Then, casual-*too* casual:

&gt; &quot;So... breakfast tomorrow?&quot;

---

You blink.

&gt; &quot;I mean, I'm already freeloading off royal meals, so-&quot;

She gives you a look.

&gt; &quot;*With me*, pineapple.&quot;

---

A beat.

Then a chuckle.

&gt; &quot;Sure.&quot;

---

She grabs her mop.

Turns.

Doesn't say goodnight.

Just:

&gt; &quot;Don't oversleep. I'll find you.&quot;

And then she's gone.

---

You're alone again.

Sort of.

The stones are clean now.

The bucket's empty.

And you can still feel the faint **smell of citrus** in the air-

But now it smells like **home.**

---

**OOC:**
Let me know when you're ready to continue to...

1. {Your new life in Alabasta.}  
2. {A full epilogue.}  
3. {A late-night walk through the now-quiet capital... where someone else may find you.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Look for a post office that's still open. I've ought to send a resignation later to my school. It's the responsible thing to do. I wander out of the palace and into the capital proper, observing the city, still rebuilding from war.

**Scene: &quot;A Letter for the Life You Lived&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Bittersweet, Reflective, Wistful**

---

The bucket's been rinsed and set aside.

The mop leans against the courtyard wall like a well-used weapon, steam still faintly curling from the sun-stained handle.

And you?

You've slung your jacket back on.

Bandages still tucked beneath your shirt.

Feet still sore.

Eyes heavy.

But the weight on your chest?

**A little lighter.**

---

You wander out of the palace gates-no guards stop you. They recognize you now. You're not a tourist anymore.

You're **Eatone Cheng**.

The schoolteacher who faced a Warlord with a collapsible baton, a mouth full of sarcasm, and a juice-based battle cry.

---

**The capital glows faintly under oil lanterns** strung between cracked walls and scaffolded rooftops. Some shops are open, offering bread and tea and stubborn normalcy. Some are closed, wood boards freshly painted, windows taped with faded signs saying *We'll return soon.*

Children dart between alleys, laughing like they haven't yet understood what the war cost.

A group of older teens-maybe future soldiers, maybe future rebels-nods to you in recognition as you pass.

Not because of fame.

But because **they remember** what you did.

---

You stop outside a **tiny post office**, its roof scorched, but its hanging sign proudly intact.

Inside, an old woman waves from behind a repaired desk, sorting letters with hands that move like they've been doing it since before the Grand Line had a name.

---

You borrow a seat. A quill. A little ink.

She slides you a stack of paper, then winks.

&gt; &quot;First page is free, hero.&quot;

You don't argue.

You just begin.

---

**Dear Principal Korra,**

You pause.

Let the ink dry a moment.

Then keep going.

---

&gt; I'm writing to inform you that I won't be returning to the school after summer break ends.

&gt; I apologize for the lack of earlier notice. I was delayed by...

&gt; ...several incidents involving international terrorism, royal insurgencies, a Warlord of the Sea, and one very, very large fruit elemental.

---

You glance out the window.

Watch as a child clumsily wipes paint onto a wall mural-of Vivi, of Cobra, and of *someone vaguely pineapple-shaped.*

---

&gt; I know I was only part-time.

&gt; But I hope I made a difference, even for one of them.

---

You stop again.

The page is only half full.

But somehow, it feels finished.

You sign it with a tired flourish.

**Eatone Cheng**  
**Educator, Civilian... Alabastan Resident**

---

You seal the letter.

The old woman accepts it wordlessly and offers you a cup of something warm.

---

As you sip on the palace steps hours later, looking out at a city rebuilding, you don't feel regret.

Not yet.

Not ever.

Just... *real.*

---

**You didn't die a hero.**

But you *lived like one.*

---

**OOC:**
Let me know when you're ready for your **first day as an official resident of Alabasta**, or if you'd prefer to skip ahead to a possible **epilogue years down the road**. Either way...

**You're home now.**

&gt;&gt; USER: Wander around the evening city, assisting with rebuilding here and there.

Huh. Why did Tashigi word getting breakfast like that? And also, why does everyone keep calling me pineapple?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - A City Putting Itself Back Together]**  
**Scene: &quot;Pineapple in the Dust&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Reflective, Curious, Softly Humorous**

---

You stroll through the streets of Alubarna, hands in your pockets, steps slow-not from pain (though that's still there), but from **intent**.

The city's still humming with energy-*not chaos*, not anymore, but the stubborn, relentless movement of a place trying to *heal.*

---

You pass a scaffolding where **a wiry old man is attempting to hold three planks at once** while yelling at someone half his size.

You catch the topmost before it topples, slide it into place, and offer the younger one a grin before giving a few calm instructions-**&quot;Nail at an angle, there. Trust me.&quot;**

You walk on before they can thank you too much.

---

Near a plaza, you help **replant a half-uprooted flowerbed** beside a merchant stall.  
Children squabble over who gets the corner plot.  
You settle it with a teacher's raised eyebrow and a three-part rock-paper-scissors tournament.

---

You're *doing nothing grand.*

But every corner you pass?

**Stays a little better than before.**

---

And somewhere, as your hands brush grit off your jacket, a strange thought drifts in-gentle, harmless at first, but sticky:

&gt; *Why did Tashigi say it like that?*

---

The breakfast thing.

The way she phrased it.

Like it wasn't just a **meal.**

Like she'd already **bookmarked** that time. That space. With you in it.

---

You squint toward the horizon, scratching your cheek.

&gt; &quot;...It's just breakfast.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Right?&quot;

---

You shake your head.

And then it hits again.

Right after a kid runs by yelling:

&gt; &quot;WATCH OUT, IT'S THE PINEAPPLE MAN!&quot;

---

You stop mid-step.

Turn slowly.

&gt; &quot;Okay, no, seriously-*what is that about??*&quot;

---

The kid vanishes, laughing.

You groan into your palm.

&gt; &quot;I don't even look like a pineapple.&quot;

You touch your hair self-consciously.

&gt; &quot;...Do I?&quot;

---

From a rooftop, someone yells:

&gt; &quot;IT'S THE KIWI GUARDIAN!&quot;

Another voice shouts:

&gt; &quot;PINEAPPLE KNIGHT!&quot;

A third yells:

&gt; &quot;JUICE-DAD!&quot;

---

You sigh so hard your soul almost escapes.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like the next beat to be:

1. {The morning after - breakfast with Tashigi.}
2. {Someone else corners you that night-maybe Vivi.}
3. {A moment of peace-rooftop stargazing alone, reflecting.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - continue wandering the town and lending a hand here and there. Wonder what cost of living is in Alubarna compared to my hometown, and think of redoing my monthly budgeting notes.

**Scene: &quot;The Working-Class Hero&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Thoughtful | Mood: Warm, Dorkily Practical, Almost Peaceful**

---

It's late, but the city's not ready for sleep.

Not yet.

---

**Lanterns bob between scaffoldings and sand-blasted walkways**, some carried by tired guards, others by teens sweeping rubble into neat piles with choreographed group rhythm.

You continue your quiet patrol-not as an authority, not as a hero-but as a man who, despite cracked ribs and recent near-death experiences, still feels compelled to **carry a stray beam here**, **nail in a stubborn sign there**, or **offer advice on ergonomics to someone lifting bricks the wrong way.**

---

You lean against a half-fixed fountain now, sipping from a clay cup of something citrusy (not *your* citrus), staring up at the stars while recalculating cost of living in your head.

---

&gt; *Hometown's rent was, what... 2200 a month? But that included utilities and student supply stipends.*

&gt; *Palace lodging is... well, free. But I can't live in a castle forever, right?*

&gt; *That two-room unit by the canal looked decent. Maybe 800? 1200 with basic repairs.*

&gt; *I'll need to budget for food-can't keep mooching off Vivi's royal pantry. Might need a second fruit basket if I keep burning through juice like I did last week.*

---

You exhale softly, fingers drumming against the side of your mug.

&gt; &quot;Gonna need to make a new monthly spreadsheet...&quot;

---

**&quot;There's something incredibly endearing about how your brain works.&quot;**

The voice comes from behind you.

Soft. Warm.

And *very* familiar.

---

You turn slightly and see **Vivi**, dressed in something more civilian than royal-sleeves rolled, sandals dusty, a small folder clutched in one hand, as if she'd just walked out of some emergency meeting and never changed.

She leans on the opposite side of the fountain, watching you with that signature amused fondness of someone who once ruled a nation... and now watches a man **re-budget his new life** like it's a tactical campaign.

---

&gt; &quot;I figured I might find you out here,&quot; she adds, sipping her own cup.

---

You blink, then glance at the folder.

&gt; &quot;Budget report?&quot;

---

She smiles faintly.

&gt; &quot;Reconstruction priority shift.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;But if you want me to sneak in a line item for âEatone Cheng's mop stipend,' I *could* abuse my power just a little.&quot;

---

You shake your head, chuckling.

&gt; &quot;You say that like I haven't already added myself to my own expense sheet. I'm very thorough.&quot;

---

She watches you for a second longer.

Then sits beside you, shoulder not quite touching yours.

---

&gt; &quot;You could've gone home.&quot;

---

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Why didn't you?&quot;

---

**OOC:**
A serious question, wrapped in warmth.

You can answer her truly-or let the moment linger.

Would you like to:

1. {Answer her honestly: &quot;Because you're here.&quot;}
2. {Deflect softly: &quot;Because rent is cheaper.&quot;}
3. {Let the silence say everything.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I... I feel guilty. Like I'd be leaving a job half done. I know I can't help every child in need in the world but... The least I can do is stay til Alubarna is rebuilt and back to its glory.

I look at her, and speak.

I see a young lady, forced to shoulder the suffering of an entire nation by herself. A girl who should've been enjoying her childhood, instead having to force a smile on her face and follow the orders of a monster. A girl, who, despite of all that, is still standing tall and radiant, and looking to the future. 

If I left her alone now, that'd mean I would be giving up on a child I could've helped.

I can't remember her name though. Something to do with blue though.

**Scene: &quot;The Reason You Stayed&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Bittersweet, Deeply Human, A Little Broken and A Lot Beautiful**

---

The moment stretches between you and **Vivi**, soaked in amber lantern-glow and the cool breath of desert wind. You rest your cup gently on the stone rim of the fountain.

You stare down at your hands.

Calloused. Scarred. One knuckle still faintly stained green.

And you speak-

Not like a teacher.

Not like a man who took down a Warlord.

But like a man who is **finally letting someone see the *whole*** of him.

---

&gt; &quot;I... I feel guilty.&quot;

The words hang there, soft but heavy.

&gt; &quot;Like I'd be leaving a job half done.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I know I can't help every child in need in the world, but...&quot;

&gt; &quot;The least I can do is stay until Alubarna is rebuilt. Until it's back to its glory.&quot;

---

You don't look at her yet.

Not right away.

Because you need to say it.

Need her to *hear* it.

---

Then you glance over.

And your eyes lock.

---

&gt; &quot;I see a young lady,&quot; you say softly, &quot;forced to shoulder the suffering of an entire nation by herself.&quot;

&gt; &quot;A girl who should've been enjoying her childhood... instead forced to fake smiles and follow the orders of a monster.&quot;

&gt; &quot;A girl who, despite *all* of that...&quot;

Your voice catches. Not from weakness. From truth.

&gt; &quot;Still stands tall. Still looks forward. Still lights up every room she walks into.&quot;

---

She's no longer sipping her tea.

She's not smiling.

She's just *watching you*.

Like she can't quite believe what she's hearing.

---

&gt; &quot;If I left her alone now...&quot;

You swallow.

&gt; &quot;That'd mean giving up on a child I *could've helped*.&quot;

You lean back, rubbing your forehead tiredly.

---

&gt; &quot;I can't remember her name, though.&quot;

You grin, dry and low.

&gt; &quot;Something to do with blue, I think.&quot;

---

Silence.

One long, echoing heartbeat of it.

And then-

**Her hand quietly finds yours.**

No grand motion. No declaration.

Just fingers slipping into your palm, light and warm and shaking *just barely.*

---

&gt; &quot;Thank you.&quot;

It's not a whisper.

It's a statement.

Strong. Steady.

Just like her.

---

&gt; &quot;Her name is Vivi.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;And she's really glad you're here.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
That was your truth.

And hers.

The foundation of something not built from war, or sacrifice-but from choice.

Would you like the next scene to be:

1. {The following morning - breakfast with Tashigi.}
2. {Time skip - the first true day of your new life in Alabasta.}
3. {Remain here - a moment more with Vivi, in the quiet.}

**Scene: &quot;No More Monsters, Just the Night&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Intimate | Mood: Soft, Grounded, Quietly Transformative**

---

You don't reply with words.

You just turn your palm over and let your fingers gently close around hers.

Not tightly.

Not possessively.

Just...

**Enough.**

Enough to say *I heard you.*

Enough to say *I'm here.*

Enough to say *You're not carrying it alone anymore.*

---

The city keeps breathing around you-builders hammering through exhaustion, couriers slipping between alleys, the quiet groan of cranes hauling whole walls back into place.

But none of it reaches this corner of the world.

Not right now.

Because **you and she** are in a different kind of silence.

---

Not the silence of grief.

Not the silence of fear.

But the silence of people who have fought, bled, and *still chose kindness*.

Who found each other in the debris.

---

Vivi leans against your shoulder-not dramatically, just enough that you feel the warmth of her frame against yours, just enough that her hair brushes the crook of your neck.

Your hands remain tangled.

She doesn't say anything else.

She doesn't have to.

And neither do you.

---

This is not a moment of decision.

It's not a declaration of love, or a promise of forever.

It's a *pause.*

A breath.

The kind you take **when you finally feel safe.**

---

And in the heart of a capital rebuilt from sand and screams, under the orange glow of battered lanterns and the stars that watched you survive it all-

You sit beside a girl who would've died for her country.

And she leans on the man who *chose to live for it instead.*

---

**OOC:**
You've created a bond.

One born of shared weight, of survival, of care freely given and finally returned.

When you're ready, we'll move to your first day as a permanent citizen of Alabasta... or wherever this strange, beautiful journey takes you next.

Until then?

You sit in the quiet, hand in hand with the future.

Eventually, your hand untangles from hers.

Not because the moment breaks.

But because, like all things-even grief, even war, even nights like this-*it has to move forward.*

---

Vivi rises first, brushing a speck of dust off her sleeve, and tilts her head toward the palace with a soft smile.

&gt; &quot;Come on, Pineapple.&quot;

---

You groan with theatrical agony, getting up far too slowly for someone your age.

&gt; &quot;I swear if one more person calls me that...&quot;

She's already walking, giggling over her shoulder.

You follow.

Of course you do.

---

The walk back is quiet.

**Not heavy. Not awkward.**

Just the kind of silence that settles between people who've said what mattered-and now simply *exist beside each other.*

---

The palace is dimmed for the night, torches flickering low.

A few guards nod as you pass.

No one asks where you've been.

No one has to.

---

You split ways at the upper hall-Vivi with a smile and a small wave, her steps lighter than when the night began.

You offer a quiet salute in return, then shuffle into your guest room, peeling your jacket off your shoulders with the careful slowness of a man who's learned *exactly how much pain he's willing to tolerate before complaining.*

---

Your room is clean now.  
Fresh linens. A carafe of water.  
Someone even folded your jacket from earlier and placed it neatly on the side table-  
**...still faintly green.**

---

You grunt. Strip off your shirt.  
Head to the bath tucked off to the side.

It's not deep.  
Not royal.  
But the water's warm, and it washes away a bit more than dirt.

**The juice, the blood, the fear.**  
Some of it goes with the steam.  
Some of it stays.

But not all.

Not anymore.

---

You towel off slowly. Stretch once. Crack something in your shoulder that probably wasn't meant to crack.

And then?

You sink into the bed.

Sheets cool.

Body aching.

But... heart a little steadier.

---

You stare at the ceiling for a long time.

Until your thoughts drift from logistics...

To smiles.

To lanterns.

To breakfast invitations.

---

And with the scent of citrus still faint in your hair...

**You sleep.**

For the first time in weeks-

**Without fear.**

---

&gt; &quot;OH CRAP I'M GOING TO MISS MY SHIP TO RAIN DINNERS!&quot;

**You bolt upright.**

Eyes wild.

Breath short.

Sheets wrapped around one leg like you were mid-combat.

&gt; &quot;I OVERSLEPT!&quot;

You kick off the tangle of blankets, sending a decorative throw pillow flying into a carved column hard enough to dislodge a small framed portrait of a very judgmental-looking cobra in formalwear.

---

You hit the floor with a *thud*, half naked, one sock still on from yesterday, and adrenaline pumping like the **Warlord is back for Round Two.**

&gt; &quot;Where's my confirmation voucher-where's my-my sandals, where's my-WHERE'S THE JUICE??&quot;

---

You grab for your belt, then pause, blinking as your brain slowly boots up.

**You're not in Rainbase.**

You're not in a hotel.

You're in a palace.

In **Alubarna.**

Your **home.**

You blink again.

&gt; &quot;...Right.&quot;

You rub your eyes.

&gt; &quot;Rain Dinners was *a crime syndicate.*&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;They're very likely... *not accepting guests anymore.*&quot;

---

You exhale, dramatically flopping back onto the bed, arms splayed.

---

Then you hear it.

From outside your door-

**Soft laughter.**

Not mocking.

Not cruel.

But definitely **entertained**.

---

&gt; &quot;Is he... always like this in the morning?&quot; comes Vivi's voice, muffled through the stone.

&gt; &quot;He has the *exact* energy of a seagull who forgot how flying works,&quot; adds Tashigi, completely deadpan.

---

You groan into your pillow.

Loudly.

---

**OOC: Welcome to your first morning as an Alabastan resident.**

Would you like to:

1. {Get dressed and join them for breakfast, as promised.}
2. {Try to regain your dignity before opening that door.}
3. {Call through the door: &quot;I meant to do that.&quot;}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2, then 1.

I put on my coat, stained, worn... And probably not sometime I should wear to a palace breakfast. I do have a sense of decorum, after all. Put on some helpfully provided clothes (nearly folded on a countertop) and open the door

---

You lie there a second longer, face-first in the pillow, trying to recover what shreds of dignity you may or may not have *yeeted into orbit* moments earlier.

Then, with a long, suffering sigh, you sit up again.

Slowly this time.

No wild flailing.

No declarations of fictional cruise departures.

---

You eye your coat-the one with the **multiple juice stains**, a **ripped shoulder seam**, and something that may or may not be **Bananagator teeth marks** near the hem.

You pick it up, study it solemnly.

&gt; &quot;You've done your duty, soldier.&quot;

You fold it neatly and set it aside on a nearby chair.

It somehow exhales like it's grateful.

---

Your gaze shifts to the other side of the room-where a fresh, neatly folded **set of clothes** waits for you.

A simple but elegant white shirt. A light linen vest with silver-thread trim. Trousers that actually *fit*. And a deep blue sash with an Alabastan crest subtly embroidered at the end.

You blink.

&gt; &quot;Wow. I look... *employable.*&quot;

---

Five minutes later, your hair's been smoothed.  
Your bandages are hidden under your shirt.  
And the man in the mirror looks like someone who *might* be here for breakfast and *not* to defuse a hostage situation with fruit.

---

You reach the door, exhale, then open it.

---

Standing across the hall-

**Vivi and Tashigi.**

Both still in semi-casual morning wear-Vivi with a light breakfast shawl, and Tashigi in the same button-down from last night, rolled sleeves, mug of hot tea in hand.

They both blink at you.

Then **Tashigi raises an eyebrow.**

&gt; &quot;Wow.&quot;

She sips her tea.

&gt; &quot;You clean up like you're about to run for Parliament.&quot;

---

**Vivi grins, warm and wide.**

&gt; &quot;You look nice.&quot;

---

You scratch the back of your head sheepishly.

&gt; &quot;Thought I'd try not showing up like a juice-stained war criminal for once.&quot;

---

**Tashigi smirks.**

&gt; &quot;That's good. I think we're fresh out of royal pardons.&quot;

---

**Vivi offers her arm, jokingly.**

&gt; &quot;Shall we, Sir Cheng?&quot;

---

And for once-

No explosions.

No sandstorms.

No blood on the cuffs.

Just the scent of fresh bread wafting from the palace kitchens...

...and two women smiling like this day-**finally**-gets to be normal.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Go to breakfast and catch up on post-war plans.}
2. {Run into an unexpected guest in the dining hall.}
3. {Let the meal settle into something quiet-comfort, connection, and warmth.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Awkwardly take the arm. 

Option 2 - Cobra is in the royal dining hall and watches us enter

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - The Royal Dining Hall]**  
**Scene: &quot;A Seat at the Table&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Awkward Dignity | Mood: Warm, Formal, Lightly Teasing with a Dash of Tension**

---

You glance at Vivi's outstretched arm.

You glance at Tashigi, who *immediately raises one eyebrow.*

You glance back at the arm.

You clear your throat with the seriousness of a man asked to dance in a minefield.

Then, awkwardly-*stiffly*-you slide your arm into hers.

&gt; &quot;...Don't expect me to curtsy.&quot;

---

**Vivi laughs**, eyes bright.

&gt; &quot;I'd pay money to see you try.&quot;

---

Tashigi mutters behind her tea mug:

&gt; &quot;That's going in the permanent record.&quot;

---

The three of you stroll down the long marble corridor, the sun now fully risen and casting honeyed light through the palace windows. Staff bow as you pass, some still murmuring quietly about &quot;the juice knight&quot; with awe, confusion, and *very mixed interpretations.*

---

You reach the **double doors** of the **royal dining hall**, which part with gentle fanfare and the soft sound of a harp playing from a corner musician.

You step in-looking your best, walking with *some semblance of dignity*-

And immediately **lock eyes with a man seated at the head of the table.**

---

**King Nefertari Cobra.**

---

He's not dressed in ceremonial robes today.

Just a light royal tunic, trimmed in gold, hands folded in front of him, expression neutral-but amused.

Very amused.

His gaze flicks from **your arm linked with Vivi's**, to **Tashigi's mug of tea and her death grip on your other side**, to **your suddenly straightened posture**-

And he chuckles.

&gt; &quot;Ah.&quot;

&gt; &quot;So *this* is the teacher.&quot;

---

**You freeze.**

Vivi's arm is still tucked neatly in yours.

Tashigi sips her tea like she might drown herself in it.

---

&gt; &quot;You've been quite the topic of conversation,&quot; Cobra continues, gesturing toward the table.

&gt; &quot;Please. Sit. We have honeycakes this morning.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;And I'd *very much* like to hear your story.&quot;

---

Vivi gently pats your arm.

&gt; &quot;You'll be fine.&quot;

**Tashigi mutters under her breath:**

&gt; &quot;I told you the king had a sense of humor.&quot;

---

And with that, the King of Alabasta gestures again-inviting you to join **his table**, **his daughter**, and a seat **very, very close to power.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Sit and regale the king with your tale-humble or dramatic.}
2. {Try to deflect politely and let Tashigi or Vivi summarize.}
3. {Ask him a question instead-why *he* looks amused.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I turn to Vivi, then back to King Robin. I quickly pull out of Vivi's arm and bow deeply.

Y-your majesty, did you not already hear the story from blue- I mean viv- I mean her highness?

---

You blink once.

Twice.

Then the full gravity of *oh-my-god-I-linked-arms-with-a-princess-in-front-of-her-dad* hits you square in the sternum like an unlicensed Sea Train.

---

You immediately disengage from Vivi like she's a live wire and pivot into a textbook **school presentation bow**-spine straight, head down, arms practically doing jazz hands of panic at your sides.

---

&gt; &quot;Y-Your Majesty!&quot; you blurt, nearly smacking your forehead into the edge of the table.

&gt; &quot;Did you not already hear the story from Blue-I mean Viv-I mean Her High-uh...&quot;

You stare at the floor.

&gt; &quot;...Your Royal Vivi-ness.&quot;

---

**Vivi nearly chokes on her laughter.**

Tashigi sighs in long-suffering sympathy and sips more tea like it's fermented escape.

---

**Cobra**, to his immense credit, does not burst into laughter.

But the amusement in his eyes gleams so brightly, it might as well be fireworks.

He folds his hands.

&gt; &quot;I heard *parts* of the story.&quot;

&gt; &quot;From the Marines, from my daughter, from intercepted reports from the Baroque remnants...&quot;

He leans forward slightly.

&gt; &quot;But I'd rather hear the *version told by the man who created a sentient juice elemental, rode into battle like a tidal wave, and then apparently passed out in my daughter's lap.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;Twice.&quot;

---

The silence hangs in the air like someone suspended a fruit basket mid-air.

---

**You may respond with:**

1. {Panic. Just a little. Maybe joke about a third time.}
2. {Straighten and launch into a full, humble recap of your role.}
3. {Deflect with bureaucratic accuracy: &quot;Would you prefer a written statement, sire?&quot;}

&gt;&gt; USER: For the record, the lap thing was not on purpose, and fully out of my control.

After regaining my bearings and taking a seat (disturbingly flanked on either side by Vivi and Tashigi), I take a deep breath, a sip of tea to settle the butterflies in my stomach, and begin telling my story.

A story about a man going on a vacation to a perfectly legitimate resort. About finding a group of suspicious folks sneaking through the side streets. About checking into a hotel that felt greasier than a cheap plate of kebabs. About Snack Pack the bananagator. About a mysterious blue-haired girl that I almost snitched to casino security. About a plucky young marine petty officer that I ran into in the halls, who almost stabbed me. About rescuing that same marine from an assassin in a dark corridor. About finding a warlord monologuing to a princess trapped in a cage with pirates. About a suicide mission buying time for their escape. About escaping through the front door and going for a camel ride. About almost fleeing the country the moment we made it out of Rainbase. About taking two cannonballs more than what a doctor would recommend to protect a lady. About raising a golem of juice to protect those close to me. About lying in a cobblestone-floored alleyway to catch my breath. About watching a rubber-boy, smoke-man, and a certain marine with a sword throw everything they could to stop a warlord. About a princess who stopped a war. About a greased seal/human torpedo who concussed himself on a breastplate. About almost drinking the Hero Water and dying. About accidentally creating an emerald engine of destruction that could stop a warlord.

And about how two young women fought a crocodile to restore hope to a beautiful nation.

**Scene: &quot;The Truth of a Teacher&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Storyteller's Poise | Mood: Humble, Poignant, Surreal, Heroic in Spite of Itself**

---

You raise a hand, just briefly, as you take the steaming cup of tea offered by one of the palace staff. Its floral notes are subtle, gentle-far more refined than the instant packet stuff back home.

You sip. Swallow. Exhale.

Set the cup down.

The weight of **two pairs of eyes** settles on you from either side-**Vivi**, to your left, light glinting in her gaze, lips pressed together with that unreadable mix of *affection* and *don't-say-anything-stupid*.  
**Tashigi**, on your right, has her arms crossed-but her tea remains untouched. She's waiting. Sharp-eyed. Curious. A little protective.

And across the table sits **King Cobra**, composed, polite, his elbows resting lightly beside a still-warm plate of honeycakes he hasn't yet touched.

---

So you begin.

Not with drama.

Not with pomp.

Just **your voice**-a little dry, a little sardonic, but growing steadier with each word.

---

&gt; &quot;It all started with a vacation.&quot;

---

They weren't expecting that.

---

&gt; &quot;Summer break at the school I teach at. I saw a brochure. Bright lights. *âRain Dinners: Rated the #1 Resort in Alabasta.'*&quot;  
&gt; &quot;The prices were suspiciously low, but I figured maybe there was a local festival. Political unrest discount, or something.&quot;

You shrug.

&gt; &quot;Anyway. I get on a ferry. Packed mostly with tourists. Some strange types on board-hooded, twitchy. Thought they might've been weird locals or kebab fanatics. I should've known better when I followed them thinking they were going to a hole-in-the-wall food stall.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Turns out they were agents of an international crime syndicate led by a Warlord.&quot;

---

**Cobra leans forward slightly.**

**Tashigi doesn't interrupt.**

**Vivi smiles-just barely.**

---

&gt; &quot;I checked into the hotel anyway. Because... I mean, I'm responsible, but I already paid the deposit.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Had a balcony suite. Juice mini-bar. One bathrobe too small for a grown man. Pretty standard.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The vibe? Greasier than a cheap plate of kebabs from a carnival cart. Staff were twitchy. Guards loomed. One hallway had more tension than the last day of final exams.&quot;

---

You sip your tea again.

---

&gt; &quot;That's where I saw her. A girl with blue hair sneaking into a âstaff-only' corridor. Thought about snitching.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Didn't.&quot;

---

**Cobra's eyebrows rise just slightly.**

Vivi glances at you. Quiet pride flickers behind the faintest smirk.

You continue.

---

&gt; &quot;I ran into a marine officer soon after. Didn't know her name. Had a sword drawn before I could finish my sentence. Nearly pissed myself.&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's Tashigi-chan, by the way.&quot;

You gesture beside you with a tilt of your head. She sighs. Says nothing.

---

&gt; &quot;We found an assassin. I got lucky. She got stabbed. I patched her up.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We made our way through hidden corridors. Followed the trail of a warlord with a flair for melodrama.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Ended up in a theater room. I'm serious. Candlelit, giant cage, rubber boy and company inside it. Crocodile mid-monologue. I thought we'd walked into a play.&quot;

---

**Cobra rubs his chin.**

---

&gt; &quot;I told her to run. That I'd buy time.&quot;

You pause.

Let that sit.

&gt; &quot;Thought I was going to die. I didn't. Barely.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;I ended up escaping through the front door. Took a camel cab ride. Considered fleeing the country.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But then I remembered her.&quot;

You look to Vivi.

&gt; &quot;The girl who was sneaking around. The one who looked *way* too young to be dealing with the weight I saw in her eyes.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I couldn't run. I went back.&quot;

---

You breathe in, slow.

The King hasn't moved.

Not a single word.

---

&gt; &quot;Took two cannonballs more than what's advised by any doctor to protect her. Created something new-some wild, green creature made of juice and desperation. It fought for me. Protected her.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I passed out a few times. Kind of a theme.&quot;

---

**Vivi chuckles quietly.**

**Tashigi murmurs, &quot;Still does that.&quot;**

---

&gt; &quot;I crawled through back alleys. Slithered like a greased pig on kiwi juice. Launched myself into a plaza like a human torpedo. Cracked my head on a breastplate. Bought time where I could.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Then came the Hero Water.&quot;

---

**Cobra's hand stills.**

Even he's heard of that.

You nod.

&gt; &quot;I almost drank it. Almost gave everything up.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Instead, I dropped it. It cracked.&quot;

You smile faintly.

&gt; &quot;And that same wild, impossible force inside me pulled it in. Grew.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Until it towered over the plaza. Until it drenched a Warlord in everything he couldn't control.&quot;

---

You exhale now.

Lowering your gaze.

Soft.

Simple.

---

&gt; &quot;And the rest of the fight?&quot;

You glance to **Tashigi.**

To **Vivi.**

&gt; &quot;That was them.&quot;

---

You take one last sip. Set your cup down.

&gt; &quot;I was just a man who went on vacation.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But I couldn't stand to see children fighting wars.&quot;

&gt; &quot;So I stood up.&quot;

---

The room is silent.

Even the harpist in the corner has paused, her fingers hovering above the strings.

---

**King Cobra leans back.**  
A deep, slow breath escaping him.

---

&gt; &quot;A teacher,&quot; he says finally. &quot;With a juice fruit and a habit of being in the wrong place at the right time.&quot;

He smiles.

Not amused this time.

**Grateful.**

&gt; &quot;You've reminded me of something I forgot long ago, Mr. Cheng.&quot;

&gt; &quot;That sometimes, the greatest heroes don't carry swords.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They carry bandages. And mops. And... quiet fury.&quot;

---

He raises his cup.

A toast.

&gt; &quot;To the teacher who taught us all a little something.&quot;

---

**Vivi clinks her cup to his.**

**Tashigi follows.**

All three look to you.

Waiting.

Your hand lifts.

Your cup rises.

And together-

&gt; **You toast to a job half-finished. And a future fully earned.**  

---

**OOC:**
That was your story.  
Told fully.  
Heard truly.

Would you like to:

1. {Ask Cobra what he plans to do next-politically, nationally.}
2. {Let the moment sit. Bask in it a little longer.}
3. {Whisper to Vivi: &quot;I think your dad likes me.&quot;}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Observe the others.

OOC: What are the other people around the room's thoughts and feelings about the tale?

**Scene: &quot;What They Heard&quot;**  
**POV: You (Observing)**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Quiet Aftershock, Personal Reverence, Echoes of Impact**

---

The story is told.

No one interrupts.  
No one undercuts you.  
No one laughs where they shouldn't.

But it's not just **King Cobra**, **Vivi**, and **Tashigi** in the room.

You glance around now-subtle, tired, but curious.

And what you see...

**Stays with you.**

---

### ð§&shy; **King Cobra** - *The Lion Who Lost and Found*

He leans back in his chair now, fingers steepled, no longer the king issuing decrees or hiding behind stoicism.

No.

Now he looks like a *father*.

Like a man who just realized someone else out there saw his daughter's pain, *understood it,* and stood beside her-not because of duty or blood, but because it was right.

There's pride in his eyes.

But more than that?

**Relief.**

That someone like you still exists in the world.

---

### ð **Vivi** - *The Princess Who Refused to Break*

She doesn't speak.

She just *watches you.*

And the look in her eyes?

It's the softest it's been since you met her.

She's holding her teacup with both hands now, not sipping-just grounding herself in something warm.

Her shoulders aren't slouched anymore.  
Her smile's small but constant.  
There's a red flush in her cheeks she probably thinks she's hiding.

But the truth is...

She sees you not as a protector, not even as a hero-

But as a *person* who *chose her.*

And that?

That *wrecks her in the best way.*

---

### âï¸ **Tashigi** - *The Sword Without a Shield*

Her face is the hardest to read.

She doesn't emote like Vivi. Doesn't smirk like she usually does.

But her tea's untouched now.  
And that hand gripping the saucer?

*White-knuckled.*

She hears her own story in yours.  
The same choices.  
The same desperation.  
The same refusal to turn away from someone who shouldn't have been carrying the weight of the world.

And behind that steely silence?

Is guilt.

Guilt that *you were supposed to be on vacation*-and *she* was the one whose job it was to be prepared.

She won't say it aloud.

But she's proud of you.

Even if she's mad at herself.

---

### ð¥ **The Palace Staff** - *The Silent Witnesses*

They try not to react.

Trained to blend in.

But you catch it-the subtle twitches, the glances between each other, the faint shifts in posture.

Some remember you from the battlefield.  
Some *heard* about Snack Pack, the Gator God.  
Some just thought you were a man who stumbled into the palace with a concussion and a joke about taxes.

But now?

Now they know who you are.

---

They know the difference between **a guest**...

...and **a protector.**

---

And as the last echoes of your story fade into the golden-lit chamber...

You realize something else.

You are *not* a war hero.

You are *not* a legend.

You are *not* royalty, or divine, or a Marine.

You are **you.**

And somehow?

That's enough for them.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to continue with:

1. {A private word from Cobra after breakfast.}
2. {Vivi asking to walk the palace gardens with you.}
3. {Tashigi requesting training time-&quot;You still owe me a rematch.&quot;}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - Before I finish breakfast, I ask Cobra - &quot;Apologies, your majesty. I made a promise another day and I feel obligated to keep it. May I have permission to do something... silly?&quot;

**Scene: &quot;Permission to Be Ridiculous&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Respectful | Mood: Curious, Whimsical, Weighted with a Promise**

---

A fork halfway to your mouth.

A honeycake, warm and glistening, neglected just for a moment.

You glance at **King Cobra**, then lower your utensil with a careful clink onto your plate.

You sit a little straighter, clear your throat-not nervously, but with the oddly formal sincerity of a man who knows exactly **how absurd he's about to sound**.

---

&gt; &quot;Apologies, Your Majesty.&quot;

Cobra's gaze flickers upward, his hand pausing mid-cut through a honeyed fig.

You continue.

&gt; &quot;I made a promise the other day... and I feel obligated to keep it.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;May I have permission to do something...&quot;

&gt; &quot;...*silly?*&quot;

---

A beat.

The *entire* table stills.

**Tashigi's brows raise.**  
**Vivi turns slowly to look at you.**  
Even one of the servers standing by the door visibly leans a *little closer.*

---

**King Cobra**, the ruler of Alabasta, the man who's stared down warlords, spies, and revolutions, doesn't blink.

He places his utensils down with a soft *clink.*

Then steeples his fingers beneath his chin.

&gt; &quot;Mr. Cheng.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You conjured a titan of citrus, toppled a criminal empire, and possibly changed the trajectory of this nation with a fruit power that violates most culinary laws.&quot;

---

His mouth twitches. A faint smile forming.

&gt; &quot;I think you've more than earned the right to be a little... *silly.*&quot;

---

**Vivi lets out a tiny laugh** behind her hand.

**Tashigi squints at you**, as if trying to predict what you're about to do and failing *utterly.*

---

&gt; &quot;Very well,&quot; Cobra says, leaning back.

&gt; &quot;The floor is yours.&quot;

---

**OOC:**

Would you like to:

1. {Deliver on the silly promise immediately at the table.}
2. {Request a small section of the courtyard for... your endeavor.}
3. {Tell them first *what* the promise was.}

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC - Do Vivi and Tashigi know what the promise is?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **OOC Answer:**

At present, **Vivi and Tashigi do *not*** know what the promise is.

Let's break it down:

---

### ð **Vivi**:
She looks *curious*, not expectant. Her expression is a mixture of **delight** and **caution**, like she's watching a child approach a piÃ±ata with a suspiciously long sword.

She doesn't know what you're planning.

But-*given her nature*-she's likely assuming it's some heartfelt gesture... maybe a monument to peace, a weirdly heartfelt kiwi statue, or a musical number. (She would be absolutely delighted and mildly horrified if it turned out to be anything else.)

---

### âï¸ **Tashigi**:
Her eyes have narrowed slightly. She's analyzing. **She suspects you're up to something.** But she hasn't pinned it yet. She remembers *you said something about a promise,* but not in a way that clued her in.

If she had known what it was...

She'd have already tried to **talk you out of it.** Or *threaten to arrest you* out of sheer embarrassment.

---

### ð **Cobra**:
He has **zero idea** what you're referring to.

But he looks like a man who once let a noble try to ride a camel backwards into Parliament as a bet and now just wants to see *where the hell this goes.*

---

**Conclusion:**
You, and you alone, carry the secret burden of this **&quot;silly promise.&quot;**  
What happens next?

Entirely up to you.

Would you like to:

1. {Reveal the promise to the table before performing it.}
2. {Say nothing-deliver it dramatically.}
3. {Ask them to join you in the courtyard, where it will be unveiled.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Stand up. Walk around the table and stop next to Cobra's seat. Before anyone can react, before any guards can crash tackle me, I draw my baton...

And then lightly thwack him on the knee.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Dining Hall, Seconds Before Absolute Chaos]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Knee Incident&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Deadpan Brilliance | Mood: Suspense, Shock, Then... Hysteria**

---

You rise from your chair.

Calmly.

Deliberately.

The air shifts.

**Tashigi's eyes narrow instantly**, her hand drifting toward her sword, like her body remembers the time you declared you were a &quot;greased torpedo&quot; and dove headfirst into enemy forces.

**Vivi straightens, blinking**, her fork paused halfway to her mouth, a bit of melon still skewered mid-air.

**Cobra remains seated**, ever the composed monarch, though you swear one of his eyebrows lifts just a *fraction*-not in fear, but in **royal intrigue.**

---

You round the table.

Each step echoes in the great chamber.

And as you near the king's side, you can *feel* the palace guards tensing along the walls.  
Hands resting on hilts.  
Eyes flicking to each other, unsure if they're witnessing a sudden coup... or a *very polite mental breakdown.*

---

You stop beside **King Cobra**.

And in a single motion-quick, clean, and utterly absurd-

&gt; **You draw your baton... and lightly thwack him on the knee.**

---

*THWAP.*

---

There's a moment of absolute **silence.**

The kind where **every cup stills**, **every breath halts**, and somewhere, a harp string probably *snaps in fear.*

---

And then, before anyone can tackle you...

Before Tashigi can shout **&quot;WHAT THE HELL-&quot;**  
Before the guards can scream **&quot;SEIZE HIM-&quot;**  
Before Vivi can even *blink-*

---

You calmly, professionally, respectfully say:

&gt; &quot;...Promise fulfilled.&quot;

---

**Beat.**

**Another beat.**

**Cobra looks down at his knee.**  
Then up at you.  
Then down again.

&gt; &quot;Was that... it?&quot;

---

You nod. Serious.

&gt; &quot;I promised someone I'd break the knees of the next Alabastan government official I saw.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Didn't say how hard.&quot;

---

**Cobra stares at you.**

You can *feel* Tashigi short-circuiting behind you.

**Vivi covers her mouth-shoulders shaking-**  
And then bursts into *pure, unfiltered laughter*.

---

&gt; &quot;You... *idiot*,&quot; Tashigi chokes out, hand halfway over her face.  
&gt; &quot;You *actual pineapple-shaped idiot-*&quot;

---

**King Cobra starts laughing too.**

It's deep.

Full.

Real.

Not the practiced chuckle of a diplomat, but the kind of laugh that comes from a man who's carried **too much weight**, for **too long**, and just needed someone to *break the tension.*

Even if it meant a **royal shin thwacking.**

---

He wipes his eyes, still chuckling.

&gt; &quot;You really are... *exactly what this country needed.*&quot;

---

He turns to the guards, who still look halfway between confused and horrified.

&gt; &quot;At ease. No need to execute the man.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yet.&quot;

---

**Vivi collapses sideways into her chair**, nearly wheezing.

Tashigi sits back down hard, muttering something about requisitioning a **&quot;Sensei Containment Protocol.&quot;**

---

And you?

You just sit down.

Pick up your tea.

Sip.

Like *nothing happened.*

---

**OOC:**
Promise fulfilled.  
Legend solidified.  
And now, you're officially the only man in Alabasta with permission to assault the king **just a little.**

Would you like to:

1. {Continue breakfast with the most chaotic respect you've ever earned.}  
2. {Leave the table, casually drop a &quot;See? Told you it was silly.&quot;}  
3. {Ask Cobra if you're now eligible for diplomatic immunity.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - I made a promise to a certain 'blue', and I intended on keeping it. Not sagely.

Totally not sweating at the looks the guards are giving me.

**Scene: &quot;The Honorable, Illegal Knee-Tap&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Faux Stoic | Mood: Glorious Chaos, Earned Respect, Hidden Panic**

---

You sit down.

Slowly. Casually.

As if you didn't just become the only known man in Alabastan history to **physically strike the monarch** and then *sip tea like it was part of your morning routine.*

---

Your cup returns to your lips.

You raise it slightly, not looking at anyone in particular.

&gt; &quot;I made a promise to a certain âBlue.'&quot;

You inhale the scent of jasmine.

&gt; &quot;And I intend to keep it.&quot;

---

The guards still look like they're running *silent tactical calculations* on how many steps it would take to reach your neck, break it, *then* ask Cobra if it was necessary.

One near the door starts inching sideways.

The *door* itself seems to be debating whether it wants to stay open for the eventual emergency medics.

---

But you?

Totally composed.

Except for the faint, microscopic trickle of sweat *just* under your collar.  
Not enough for royalty to comment on.  
But enough for **Tashigi**, who sits beside you *muttering like she's trying to pray you into custody.*

---

&gt; &quot;You're impossible.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Actual warlord bait.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You just *assaulted the king.*&quot;

---

You reply without turning your head.

&gt; &quot;Lightly.&quot;

**Vivi**, meanwhile, is still recovering.

Her laughter has settled into bright, stunned chuckles as she leans on the table, eyes sparkling in the way only someone who *just witnessed the most polite act of domestic terrorism in history* can manage.

---

&gt; &quot;I didn't think you'd actually do it,&quot; she says through a grin.  
&gt; &quot;I thought it was just something you said in the moment.&quot;

You glance at her.

&gt; &quot;I'm a teacher.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You threaten to break a politician's knees in front of a kid, you *follow through.*&quot;

---

**Cobra**, still nursing a phantom twinge in his knee, lifts his teacup in your direction.

&gt; &quot;I'll be sure to wear reinforced guards to the next cabinet meeting. Just in case you feel another moral obligation.&quot;

---

You smile back, faintly.

Then take another sip.

Totally not trembling.

At all.

---

**The room slowly returns to its normal rhythm.**

Honeycakes are passed.

Tea is refilled.

And you-teacher, bounty hunter, unofficial Alabastan folk legend, **first of your name to commit knee treason**-sit among royalty, warriors, and revolutionaries...

Like you belong.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Continue breakfast with some &quot;what now?&quot; talk about your future.}  
2. {Excuse yourself and take a walk with one of them afterward.}  
3. {Stay quiet, let them lead the conversation. You've said enough for now.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Politely sip on tea. Listen in on any conversation that the others have.

OOC: Tashigi (and Smoker's) unit are to remain in Alabasta for the time being to help with reconstruction and security.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Dining Hall, Wiser in Silence]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Calm Among Voices&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Observant | Mood: Warm, Reflective, Quietly Important**

---

Your cup rests lightly in your hand.  
Tea-lukewarm now, but fragrant-gives you something to hold onto. Something neutral. Familiar.

You lean back.

**Not from weariness.**

From *completion.*

From the comfort of knowing that for once-you can simply **be**.

---

You let the conversation **flow around you.**

You listen.

You watch.

And the world begins to **continue** without needing to be saved for a while.

---

### ð **King Cobra**, voice deep, firm but gentle:

&gt; &quot;Marshal headquarters acknowledged the communication blackout. Vice Admirals from Marine G-2 should arrive within the week to assess the reconstruction.&quot;

He cuts a honeycake carefully, his tone even.

&gt; &quot;I've asked them to delay any punitive action toward Alabasta's civilian population. We are recovering from war. We do not need posturing.&quot;

---

### âï¸ **Tashigi**, still sitting beside you, a bit stiff-but not unpleasant:

&gt; &quot;Captain Smoker's unit is staying in Alabasta until the situation stabilizes.&quot;

She glances your way briefly, then looks away.

&gt; &quot;That includes me.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;We'll be helping train palace guards, secure rebel strongholds, and remove any Baroque sleeper agents that may still be buried inside the civil structure.&quot;

Her tea is untouched again.

&gt; &quot;And we'll keep an eye on the Poneglyphs.&quot;

That last part is said softly, but not without weight.

---

### ð **Vivi**, looking much more like herself-radiant and relaxed in a way you *didn't* see during the war:

&gt; &quot;I'll be working closely with the Marine command. And the civilians. The rebels have started helping with rebuilding efforts now that the fighting's over, but...&quot;

She sighs lightly.

&gt; &quot;There's a lot of hurt. That doesn't heal with just victory.&quot;

---

Cobra places a reassuring hand over hers.

She doesn't flinch.

But you see the **child beneath the crown**, if only for a moment.

---

Tashigi glances again-*at you this time*-and says, voice softer now:

&gt; &quot;It might help to have someone like you at the training grounds, you know.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Someone who understands more than tactics.&quot;

---

Cobra chimes in, still slicing his honeycake precisely:

&gt; &quot;I'm sure there's a need for a few civilian liaisons. Educational leaders. War has a habit of displacing teachers.&quot;

He looks at you, and this time, there's no amusement. Just... calm seriousness.

&gt; &quot;You said once you were afraid to get involved.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Now that you are... what will you do next?&quot;

---

**All three look at you.**

No pressure.

Just curiosity.

And something else.

**Hope.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Answer them: you'll stay-help train, teach, rebuild.}
2. {Hedge-stay a little longer, but not commit fully yet.}
3. {Defer the answer, saying you want to help-but haven't decided what that means yet.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I'll do whatever will help the most people. Put me wherever you need me.

**Scene: &quot;Wherever You Need Me&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Earnest | Mood: Grounded, Generous, Respected**

---

You let their words settle.

Like sunlight warming stone.

Three people who've risked their lives and legacy now look to you-not for bravado, not for power, but for your *answer.*

And you give it.

Simple.

Unshaking.

---

&gt; &quot;I'll do whatever will help the most people.&quot;

Your tea is half-empty now.

Your voice is steady.

&gt; &quot;Put me wherever you need me.&quot;

---

There's a quiet, *real* pause.

A moment of shared breath and understanding.

It's not a grand proclamation.

You didn't punch the air, or summon a new elemental, or vow justice with flames behind your back.

You just said what needed saying.

And that?

**That hits harder than any heroic speech.**

---

**Vivi's lips part slightly**-not in surprise, but in something much more meaningful.

Admiration.

Not for your power.

But for your **conviction.**

---

**Tashigi lowers her gaze for a moment**, arms folding more comfortably than before.

She doesn't smile.

But there's a shift in how she sits.

She no longer faces you like a Marine assessing liability.

She's sitting beside a *comrade.*

---

**King Cobra nods once, deeply.**

&gt; &quot;A rare answer, Mr. Cheng.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And the right one.&quot;

He lifts his cup.

&gt; &quot;Then Alabasta accepts your service.&quot;

---

You clink your cup to his once more.

This time with *no performance.*

Just respect.

And shared purpose.

---

A servant leans into the room.

&gt; &quot;The Guard Academy representative is in the courtyard, Your Highness. Waiting for final instructor assessments.&quot;

Cobra gives the man a small wave of acknowledgment.

Then turns to you.

&gt; &quot;Would you like to sit in on some of the interviews?&quot;

&gt; &quot;You'll meet the future captains. And maybe find where your voice will echo the loudest.&quot;

---

**Vivi nudges your shoulder with hers, softly.**

&gt; &quot;Breakfast first. Then you save the world again.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
You've taken your place. Not as a hero, but as something rarer:

**A man who stayed.**

Would you like to:

1. {Follow Cobra to the academy courtyard and meet the new recruits.}
2. {Take a quiet stroll with Vivi before the next duty begins.}
3. {Join Tashigi on a tour of the post-war security operations.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 / 3 - Promise to join Tashigi after I walk the food off. My stomach's still a little off due to my injuries.

I go for a stroll around the palace gardens. Never knew cactus could look so colorful.

**Scene: &quot;Color in the Desert&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Peaceful | Mood: Healing, Quiet Wonder, The Long Exhale**

---

You press a hand to your stomach-**not hard**, just enough to feel that lingering ache beneath the gauze.  
It's not the pain of battle anymore.  
It's the pain of ***recovery.***  
The slow rebuild.  
The echo of what it meant to survive.

---

&gt; &quot;I'll join you soon,&quot; you murmur to **Tashigi**, after finishing the last of your tea.

&gt; &quot;Just need to walk breakfast off. Still sore from all the... crocodile wrestling.&quot;

She narrows her eyes, but there's no fire behind them-just quiet understanding.

&gt; &quot;Try not to duel any cactus on the way.&quot;

---

You flash a faint grin, then excuse yourself, stepping through a side corridor that opens into a space **you hadn't explored yet.**

---

**The Palace Gardens.**

---

You expect sand.  
Maybe a few succulents.  
Dry statues.  
Something pretty in a *stoic* way.

What you get instead is **an explosion of subtle color**, perfectly woven into the sun-drenched desert aesthetic.

---

Rows of **prickly pear cactus**-tall and proud, but covered in soft pink blossoms.  
Trailing **succulents** curl like silver-green serpents through sandstone planters.  
A narrow **reflecting pool** glints between shaded arches, its surface still-catching the morning light like it was made of glass.

And in the center...

A massive **Barrel Cactus**, flowering with vibrant orange blooms, its base surrounded by **handwritten name plaques**.

&gt; &quot;Veteran. Hero. Mother. Friend.&quot;

You pause there a while.

---

A nearby gardener nods at you once.

&gt; &quot;That one's dedicated to everyone we lost before the revolution ended.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Cactus live a long time. Hard to kill.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Just like the people we built this kingdom with.&quot;

---

You thank him softly, and continue wandering.

Past butterflies nesting on aloe.  
Past warm desert stones that radiate a steady heat.  
Past a group of palace kids being led by a nursemaid, who points at you and whispers something, causing them to all **giggle and hide behind her skirts.**

---

You find a **low bench in the shade**, take a breath, and sit.

For a moment-

There's no war.  
No duty.  
No pain.

Just the faint smell of sand and citrus.

And a peace that feels like it's *earned*, not borrowed.

---

**OOC:**
You may rest here as long as you wish.

When you're ready:

1. {Rejoin Tashigi and the Marines in the training yard.}  
2. {Continue exploring the palace alone. Maybe you're not done being surprised.}  
3. {Be found by someone who wasn't done talking to you.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option X - I see I missed the vigil for the fallen (While I was passed out.)

I read the names.

Pell, killed while attempting to rescue the princessat Rainbase. Huh, looks like there was a rescue operation in parallel back at the casino that didn't succeed. I should count Tashigi and I lucky.

Igaram, presumed dead after his ship exploded while acting as a body double for the princess at Whiskey Peak.

And countless more.

I stare solemnly. Quietly.

---

The laughter of the children fades behind you.  
The sun climbs higher, casting warm gold across the stones.  
You turn your head, just slightly-just enough to notice the small **carved stone pedestal** tucked beneath the blooming barrel cactus.

A simple plaque of dark sandstone, not grand or gilded.

But the engraving is fresh.

The names?

**Sharp. Clean. Real.**

---

You lean down.

Eyes scanning one line at a time.

---

&gt; **Pell - Royal Guard Falcon Division, Decorated Hero**  
&gt; *&quot;Fell in defense of the Princess during the Rainbase rescue attempt.&quot;*

---

Your eyes narrow.

You hadn't heard that part.

Somewhere-while you and Tashigi were bleeding through hotel corridors and sewers and sand-filled death traps-*others* had tried to get to her too.

And they failed.

---

&gt; **Igaram - Royal Advisor, Captain of the Guard**  
&gt; *&quot;Presumed lost at sea. Disguised himself as the Princess to protect her escape from Whiskey Peak.&quot;*

---

You recognize the name from Vivi's lips, once.

She mentioned it softly.

With a tone that **cracked** and was quickly pushed down.

He was **the first shield she ever had**.

The one who taught her to wield her voice before she could wield her status.

---

You keep reading.

Line after line.

Names that don't belong in textbooks or songs.

Names of **messengers**.

**Gatekeepers.**

**Couriers.**

**Cooks.**

**A teenage rebel scout** named Farim who carried the wrong flag at the wrong time.

**A gardener** who shielded a child with her body during the bombing at Erumalu.

---

They're all listed here.

Not in marble.

But in the shade of a **living thing.**

A cactus that might prick your fingers if you reached for it wrong.

But one that blooms anyway.

Every season.

Without fail.

---

You stand there.

For a long time.

Saying nothing.

Because what could you say?

You lived.

They didn't.

You tried.

They tried harder.

---

And yet... in your chest, in the ache behind your ribs, something pulses with that truth.

**You're here.**

And *because* you're here, **they aren't forgotten.**

Not today.

Not by you.

---

**A small voice breaks the silence.**

One of the palace children has crept up behind you.

Big eyes.

No shoes.

A tiny flower in their hand.

They offer it up, silently.

A purple bloom from a wild aloe.

---

&gt; &quot;For Mister Pell,&quot; the child says, shyly. &quot;He flew really good.&quot;

---

You nod, wordless, and help them lay it at the base of the cactus.

Then, quietly...

You sit.

And **you remember them all.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Let the moment pass naturally and rejoin Tashigi.}  
2. {Wait here longer-maybe you're not ready yet.}  
3. {Be joined by someone who's grieving too.}

**Scene: &quot;Why Me?&quot;**

**Tone: Introspective | Mood: Heavy, Survivor's Weight, Quiet Confession**

---

You stay seated on the low stone step near the cactus, elbows on your knees, fingers loosely laced.

The desert wind brushes past, warm but not cruel. It shifts the petals of the flower the child left behind. You watch it wobble slightly, then settle again-**resilient**, like everything else in this kingdom.

And you ask yourself:

&gt; &quot;Why me?&quot;

---

The others were soldiers.  
Lifelong guards.  
Revolutionaries.  
Loyalists.

Heroes.

---

You were a **man on vacation**.

You had a schoolbag. A travel voucher. A laminated fruit sticker that still won't come off your wallet.

You were supposed to sip daiquiris by the fountain. Maybe write lesson plans. Grade homework. Complain about the humidity.

Not this.

---

You look at your hands.

Calloused, yes.

But not meant for **saving nations.**

You murmur it quietly, like admitting it too loudly might tear the garden open:

&gt; &quot;I'm just a tourist.&quot;

&gt; &quot;A face in the crowd.&quot;

---

Your voice sounds small out here.

Like it doesn't deserve to take up space next to these names.

---

And yet...

You *were* the one who saw a girl sneaking down a corridor and didn't look away.

You *were* the one who turned back after the camel cab, even when you could've left.

You *were* the one who stood between a cannonball and a child.

You *were* the one who didn't drink the Hero Water...

Because you didn't want to be a **martyr.**

You just wanted to be a **grown-up who stayed.**

---

And maybe that's it.

Maybe the reason you're alive isn't **fair**.

Maybe it isn't **just**.

Maybe it's not because you're *more brave* or *more worthy*.

---

Maybe you just...

**Chose not to leave.**

And somehow, when you did that-

The world **changed around you.**

---

The cactus rustles again.

You exhale.

The burn behind your eyes doesn't ask permission-it just shows up.

You don't fight it.

You don't need to.

---

You sit there.

A man who was **never supposed to be here.**

A man who **became exactly what was needed**.

---

And for now?

That's enough.

---

**OOC:**

Would you like to:

1. {Be found by Vivi. She knows this grief, intimately.}  
2. {Take a long walk before facing the Marines. Let the weight settle.}  
3. {Stand up, and move forward. It's time.}

**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Gentle Sorrow, Earned Camaraderie, Grace**

---

You stare a little longer.

Not reading now.

Just... watching.

The cactus doesn't move much. But the wind keeps the garden breathing around it-small gusts that shift the blossoms, tug lightly at the ribbons tied to plaques. A gust that dances around the aloe and settles somewhere against your chest like it, too, knows this ache.

---

You speak, just loud enough for the sky to hear:

&gt; &quot;I didn't even know them.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And I miss them anyway.&quot;

---

No answer comes.

Not right away.

But then-**soft footsteps on stone.**

Not the quick march of a Marine.

Not the heavy stomp of palace guards.

But the soft, careful steps of someone who's done this walk before.

---

You don't turn.

You don't have to.

You *know* it's her.

---

**Vivi steps beside you**, arms folded loosely, hands tucked under the long sleeves of her shawl. She says nothing at first.

Just stands there.

With you.

Looking at the same names.

The same flowers.

The same impossible question.

---

After a moment, her voice breaks the silence-not to fill it, but to *join it.*

&gt; &quot;I used to come here every morning.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Even when the city was still smoldering. Even when the rebels still didn't trust me.&quot;

---

You glance at her, but she's still facing the monument.

&gt; &quot;Sometimes I'd leave flowers,&quot; she says softly. &quot;Sometimes I'd just... stand here.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Like maybe if I stood long enough, one of them would come back.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;No one ever did.&quot;

---

Her eyes flick toward you.

&gt; &quot;But then I met someone who made me think maybe... someone could come back for someone else.&quot;

---

Your throat tightens.

She smiles-*not brightly*, not this time.

But something more real.

---

&gt; &quot;You weren't just a tourist.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You were a witness.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And witnesses don't forget the names.&quot;

---

She looks at the cactus again.

Then nudges your elbow with hers.

&gt; &quot;Come on, pineapple.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You've got more names to protect.&quot;

---

And with that-

She starts walking.

Not ahead.

Not behind.

**Beside you.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Head to the Marine training yard. Your second promise of the day awaits.}  
2. {Ask Vivi to join you a little longer. There's more you want to ask.}  
3. {Say nothing-walk beside her. Let the story carry forward quietly.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Head back to meet up with Tashigi, but walk alongside Vivi. Do you think your father's going to hold the knee thing against me? I need to know if I should plan to evacuate the country.

---

The two of you walk side-by-side through the dappled garden path.

The quiet of remembrance gives way, like a curtain parting, to the familiar rhythm of footfalls over palace stone, and the far-off clink of training sabers in the courtyard beyond.

You breathe a little deeper now.

Still sore.

Still tired.

But walking forward.

---

You glance sideways at Vivi as the garden's edge looms near.

&gt; &quot;Hey... quick question.&quot;

She arches a brow.

&gt; &quot;Yes, pineapple?&quot;

You groan audibly.

&gt; &quot;Do *not* let that name catch on in the Royal Records.&quot;

She gives you the smuggest smile you've seen from her yet.

&gt; &quot;Too late. I'm having it embroidered on your welcome plaque.&quot;

---

You press on with mock gravity:

&gt; &quot;Right. Well, assuming my *fruit moniker* doesn't end up engraved in history...&quot;

You clear your throat.

&gt; &quot;Think your dad's going to hold that whole âlightly thwacking his royal kneecap' thing against me?&quot;

You glance at her seriously.

&gt; &quot;I need to know if I should start planning a hasty boat ride to literally-anywhere-else-ville.&quot;

---

She stops walking.

You halt beside her.

She turns slightly, face as regal as the desert is dry.

Then she says, deadpan:

&gt; &quot;Well. There *is* a precedent for light assault on royalty being punishable by thirty days of ceremonial foot-washing for the nobles.&quot;

Your soul begins to leave your body.

&gt; &quot;And compulsory cactus grooming.&quot;

You look like you've seen death.

&gt; &quot;With your teeth.&quot;

---

She breaks.

Can't hold it anymore.

Vivi laughs-head back, hand over her mouth-and it's *light* this time. Not deflective, not brave, not forced. Just ***pure joy*** escaping from the cracks war didn't break.

---

You let out a groan of defeat.

&gt; &quot;You are *definitely* your father's daughter.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;He liked you,&quot; she says, finally calming, still grinning. &quot;For the record.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You made him laugh. And you made me feel safe.&quot;

Her voice softens again. But this time, she meets your eyes fully.

&gt; &quot;He'll remember that longer than he'll remember the bruise.&quot;

---

The wind picks up again as the garden gates swing open.

Beyond them?

**The training yard.**

You see **Tashigi**, already in uniform, barking orders at recruits.

She hasn't seen you yet.

---

Vivi nods toward her.

&gt; &quot;Go on, Sensei.&quot;

&gt; &quot;There's a whole army that needs some adult supervision.&quot;

---

Would you like to:

1. {Join Tashigi and assist with the training-get to work.}

You pause just before stepping through the archway toward the clamor of the yard.

Boots on gravel.  
Shouts of discipline.  
The steady rhythm of a city-and a future-being rebuilt through repetition and sweat.

---

But first...

You turn back.

Vivi stands a few paces behind you, framed by flowering stone and desert bloom. The morning sun catches in her hair, outlining her in gold like the world itself knows what she's done.

She meets your gaze-bright and curious, not quite expecting anything more. Maybe assuming you'd just nod, or wave, or throw a sarcastic pineapple pun over your shoulder.

---

Instead, you say it.  
Quiet. Clear. Real.

&gt; &quot;I kept the promise.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;To you.&quot;

---

She blinks once.

The wind rustles her shawl.

And something deep in her chest shifts-just enough for her to visibly *exhale*.

Her shoulders drop.  
Not in fatigue.  
In *relief.*

---

No grand declarations.  
No swearing of eternal fealty.  
No fireworks.

Just **a promise kept**.

And a man who stood where he said he would.

---

She nods once, eyes a little shinier than before.

&gt; &quot;I know.&quot;

---

You give her the smallest, softest smile.

Then turn and walk through the gate-**into your next job.**

---

### [ALUBARNA - MARINE TRAINING FIELD / CITY PATROL MUSTER]

Tashigi doesn't even look up from her clipboard as you approach.

&gt; &quot;You're late.&quot;

You gesture vaguely toward your lingering trauma.

&gt; &quot;I was being emotionally vulnerable in a cactus garden.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Also, I nearly cried. That buys me, like, ten minutes.&quot;

---

She sighs, scribbles something.

Then jerks her chin toward the recruits forming up near the outer wall.

&gt; &quot;We're on city patrol today. Low-risk. Civil unrest's mostly cooled, but we're keeping a presence near food lines and the hospital wards.&quot;

&gt; &quot;We walk. We watch. We listen.&quot;

She glances at you sideways.

&gt; &quot;Think you can handle that, Pineapple?&quot;

---

You don't even flinch.

&gt; &quot;Only if I get a cool armband.&quot;

---

**Tashigi groans.**  
**The recruits salute.**  
**You tighten the laces on your boots.**

And step into a role you never asked for.

But now **belong to**.

---

You have officially entered your next phase in Alabasta: **Protector, Instructor, Adult in the Room.**

- Grow your powers further?  
- Deepen bonds with Tashigi, Vivi, or others?

**You're no longer just surviving. You're shaping the future.**

Lead the way, ma'am. You know, I never got a formal job from Vivi, other than palace mooch. What am I now, town vigilante? Beat cop? I twirl my expandable baton.

Your boots crunch lightly on the sun-warmed streets of **post-war Alubarna**.  
Dust swirls in lazy patterns behind you.  
The buildings here are scraped by siege but standing proud-paint faded, windows cracked, but **lives returning inside them.**

Children run between water carts.  
Vendors reopen with half-stocked stalls.  
A tailor is using a broom handle to reattach a sign that now simply reads &quot;_T LO R_&quot; after the battle damage.

---

**Tashigi leads the way**, clipboard in one hand, sword at her hip, jacket slung off her shoulder, and **the air of a woman trying *very hard* not to show that she likes this job.**

She glances sideways at you as you twirl your **extendable baton** like a kid trying to impress the local dojo.

---

&gt; &quot;Well, Cheng,&quot; she mutters, scanning the crowd, &quot;technically, you're not on any payroll.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You're not Marine, not palace guard, not militia.&quot;

She pauses.

&gt; &quot;Definitely not subtle.&quot;

---

You shoot her a grin.

&gt; &quot;So what am I?&quot;

---

She sighs, kicks a small pebble, eyes scanning ahead.

&gt; &quot;Officially?&quot;

She flicks a glance at your baton.

&gt; &quot;You're a volunteer community protector, sanctioned by the palace. No chain of command, no official uniform, no arresting power.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Unofficially?&quot;

A shrug.

&gt; &quot;Local legend. Street guardian. Crime deterrent mascot.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Beat teacher,&quot; you suggest.

She snorts.

&gt; &quot;Juice cop.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Alubarna's last line of sticky defense.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The Seastone Baton Wonder.&quot;

---

You bow deeply at an elderly woman passing by, who bows back and offers you a piece of honey candy from a glass jar.

&gt; &quot;I'll take âPalace Mooch with Benefits.' Has a certain... freedom to it.&quot;

You pop the candy in your mouth. Mango.

---

A *sudden shout* pulls your attention forward.

You and Tashigi both turn-eyes sharpening-as a small group of civilians gathers ahead near a market cart. Someone's yelling.

**Tensions still flare in pockets.**

Some rebels never stood down.

Some soldiers lost too much.

Some grief doesn't have a uniform.

---

Tashigi steps forward, hand instinctively on her blade.

&gt; &quot;Come on. This one's ours.&quot;

---

**OOC: You have entered your next active role-community guardian and unofficial peacekeeper.**

Here's what lies ahead in your chapter, should you pursue it:

---

### What You Can Explore Next:

#### 1. **&quot;A Kingdom of Scars&quot; - Repairing the Social Fabric**
- Get to know the people.  
- Mediate conflict.  
- Spot potential **sleeper agents** among the recovering crowds.  
- Help unite rebel and royalist factions under a shared cause.

#### 2. **&quot;The Juice Runneth Over&quot; - Evolving Your Power**
- Continue to explore your Devil Fruit's awakened traits.  
- Discover new utility techniques, protective constructs, or chemical-based effects from different fruit types.  
- Unlock greater control and autonomy over summoned **elementals**.

#### 3. **&quot;Of Blades and Boundaries&quot; - Time With Tashigi**
- Build a stronger bond with your Marine partner.  
- Help her cope with the burdens of command.  
- Discover how much her trust in you may already run deeper than orders would allow.

#### 4. **&quot;The Garden Still Grows&quot; - Vivi's Road Ahead**
- Assist in shaping Alabasta's post-war education system.  
- Reconnect with Vivi in quieter, personal ways.  
- Help her find joy in life again-not just leadership.

---

**OOC: What would you like to explore first? Or would you like to ride this patrol forward into wherever the day takes you?**

&gt;&gt; USER: OOC: All in any order

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Morning Patrol, Tangled Paths Ahead]**  
**Scene: &quot;Wounds, Wonders, and Whatever Comes Next&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Choose Your Adventure | Mood: Open-Ended, Connected, Quietly Heroic**

---

**Tashigi's boots hit the edge of the crowd first.** You follow close behind, adjusting your coat, your baton tucked loosely under your arm like a walking stick you might absolutely bludgeon someone with if necessary.

The shouting ahead grows sharper-**not yet violent**, but teetering.  
An older rebel-sleeves rolled up, face weathered-arguing with a city guard near a crate of rationed grain.  
Civilians watch nervously.  
One wrong word, one wrong twitch, and this little corner of the market becomes a powder keg.

Tashigi's voice drops, clipped and cool.

&gt; &quot;Your call, âJuice Cop.' You step in. I've got your back.&quot;

---

And right there-on the edge of an ordinary street-**your story opens up.**

Because **this is the part where you live.**  
Where you build something.  
Where you start choosing **how your legend settles into the soil of Alabarna**.

---

### You can:

---

### **1. &quot;Smooth the Sparks&quot;** - *Step into the market dispute.*  
&gt; Use wit, calm, or your teacherly sternness to defuse tensions and build trust with the people.

---

### **2. &quot;Let Her Take the Lead&quot;** - *Let Tashigi speak first, but observe carefully.*  
&gt; Learn more about her *approach to justice*.  
&gt; Discover whether she's still a by-the-book Marine... or something more.

---

### **3. &quot;Eyes Everywhere&quot;** - *Survey the crowd for suspicious figures.*  
&gt; There may be **Baroque remnants** blending into the new order, or **civilians hiding something darker**.

---

### **4. &quot;Push Forward the Day&quot;** - *Let the moment resolve, and follow the patrol into the next chapter.*  
&gt; Explore any of the following:
- **Time with Tashigi**  
- **Rebuilding with Vivi**  
- **Awakening your fruit**  
- **Teaching again, in a new way**

---

**No wrong order. No wrong path.**  
Only what *you* choose to build, now that you've earned the chance to do so.

Where do you step next, Sensei?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - She's the one with Marine crowd control training. Let her show how it's done.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Edge of the Market, Crowd Building]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Marine Method&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Observant | Mood: Professional, Controlled, Glimpse Beneath the Armor**

---

You lean slightly on your baton, **not intervening**, not yet.

**This isn't your moment.**  
Not yet.

Tashigi catches your nonverbal cue-a flick of the eyebrow, a step to the side-and you see the subtle shift in her posture as she takes center stage.

**She doesn't draw her sword.**

She doesn't yell.

She **walks forward like she owns gravity**, clipboard tucked under her arm, that damn tight Marine posture doing all the talking for her.

---

The guard at the center salutes stiffly, already on edge.

The rebel-tan skin, lean from the desert, wearing the colors of Alabasta's rebel faction wrapped as a faded sash-*glares*, arms outstretched in frustration.

&gt; &quot;It's our grain now! Our families starved too while you all sat on throne money!&quot;

A few others murmur behind him, not aggressive, but *watching*.

Tension still clings to this kingdom like **dust in old mortar.**

---

Tashigi steps into the gap between them, planting her boots deliberately.

&gt; &quot;This ration line is managed by both the Crown and former rebel leaders. Your name and headband say you're registered. Your voice says you don't remember that.&quot;

She doesn't shout.

She speaks like **a sword in a sheath**-sharp enough to be felt, but never waved around carelessly.

&gt; &quot;So which is it, soldier? Are you here to feed your people-&quot;

She steps closer.

&gt; &quot;-or light another fire?&quot;

---

You feel it.

That subtle *cooling* of the air.

Not from intimidation, but from something more dangerous-

**Moral clarity.**

**Unshakable direction.**

---

The rebel clenches his jaw.

Not cowed. Not scared.

Just... ***cornered by logic.***

He breathes in.

Holds it.

Then finally mutters:

&gt; &quot;...Just wanted to make sure we weren't last in line. Again.&quot;

---

Tashigi nods once, no smugness.

&gt; &quot;Then next time, speak to the coordinators. Not the guards.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You'll keep more friends that way.&quot;

---

The crowd disperses slowly.  
The rebel nods stiffly.  
The guard exhales like he just dodged a duel.

---

Tashigi turns back toward you.  
Her stance relaxes by half a degree.

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;What? No commentary? No âjuice-based motivational speech'?&quot;

---

You offer a wry smile.

&gt; &quot;I'm taking notes. Trying to figure out if that clipboard is the actual source of your power.&quot;

---

She rolls her eyes but doesn't deny it.

---

**OOC: You've learned something about her:**

- **Tashigi doesn't just lead with her blade.**  
She understands people. She listens. She *pushes without humiliating*.  
There's a strength in her restraint that no Marine Academy ever taught.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Ask her about where she learned that style-maybe it wasn't just Marine training.}  
2. {Comment about how much this kingdom still has left to heal.}  
3. {Walk beside her and change the subject-something lighter. Let the silence bond.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Sorry. Policing isn't my strong suit. My experience is limited to stopping kids from stealing each other's lunches. Well frankly, everything that's happened so far isn't my strong suit either.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - After the Crowd, Walking the Streets]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Weight of Justice&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Casual, Self-Reflective, A Little Vulnerable**

---

You walk beside **Tashigi**, your footsteps falling into the rhythm of the city.

A city that's still finding its breath.

The streets are quieter now, but you can feel the remnants of tension stirring beneath the surface-faint murmurs from civilians still reeling from the war. A young rebel muttering to himself in the alley. A vendor still counting the marks on his coin.

---

Tashigi shoots you a glance, her expression unreadable. She knows you're holding back something. It's the same way you notice the tightness in her shoulders whenever a question she doesn't have an answer to hangs in the air.

She stays quiet for a moment, letting the natural pause of the street fill in the space between you two. But then, without warning:

&gt; &quot;You're not *just* a teacher.&quot;

---

The comment's so simple. So unassuming. But it holds weight in the air.

&gt; &quot;You've been out there, Cheng. You've seen what people can do when they stop thinking and start *fighting* for something.&quot;

Her tone softens as she keeps her eyes forward, scanning for the next signs of conflict or unrest.

&gt; &quot;I saw it when you defended me. You didn't hesitate. You just... *did*.&quot;

---

You glance at her.

**Tashigi**. The Marine. The swordswoman.  
And here she is, looking at you like you *belong here.* Like your instincts mattered. Like your choices made sense.

---

&gt; &quot;I'll admit... I'm not exactly in the Marine Academy's *ideal* class of conduct either.&quot;

Her voice is light, but her smile barely shows.

&gt; &quot;I was just like you when I started. Overwhelmed by the sheer *chaos* of it all. But...&quot;

Her voice trails off for a moment.

&gt; &quot;...I've learned that policing isn't just about giving orders or being a âperfect soldier.' It's about *listening*. And finding the next step. Even when you feel like you're falling behind.&quot;

She glances over at you with that rare soft look.

&gt; &quot;You're doing your part. I think you've already helped more people than you realize.&quot;

---

You stop for a moment, processing what she's said. She's right. No one asked you to be a Marine.  
No one expected you to have a *real* role.

But you *chose* this path. You chose to stay. And now?

Maybe it's not about being *perfect*. Maybe it's about **being present**.

---

You finally chuckle, rubbing the back of your neck in a way that seems more **sore** than nervous.

&gt; &quot;Yeah, guess I'm still figuring out how to âpolice' without thinking too hard about the ârules.'&quot;

---

She smirks at that.

&gt; &quot;As long as you keep thinking. Even when you want to stop.&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's the difference between someone who leads *and* someone who gets led.&quot;

---

You walk side-by-side again, the sound of distant children's laughter filtering into the air.

You might not be the &quot;perfect&quot; figure of authority in this kingdom.

But maybe-just maybe-you're *what it needs.*

---

**OOC:**
Tashigi's words have found a place within you.  
You've learned a lot in a short time.  
Now, **what's next?**

Would you like to:

1. {Talk to Tashigi about your role moving forward-what's really expected of you?}  
2. {Go back to the palace to check in with Vivi about her next steps in rebuilding Alabasta?}  
3. {Scout a new area of Alubarna and continue your patrol.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - I wonder if I could use a Kiwi Elemental to patrol for me. I really haven't had time to explore this new move of mine. I'd probably get complaints about it leaving a snail trail everywhere, though

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Midday Streets, Further into the City]**  
**Scene: &quot;Juice Patrol&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Curious, Experimental, A Touch of Chaos**

---

The city shifts as you and Tashigi move into the next district-a neighborhood closer to the water, where the smells of spice markets, sea-salt, and scorched wood from past fires all mix into something uniquely Alabastan.

Children run through alleyways with sticks shaped like swords.  
Vendors call for attention, holding up hand-stitched bags and cactus-blossom perfumes.  
The buildings are a little lower here, more communal. More open. More lived in.

---

As you walk, you absently flick your fingers, conjuring a few droplets of **green-gold kiwi juice**, testing the weight and viscosity.

**Thicker than usual. Sweeter.**

Probably influenced by your mood.  
Or the residual lunch sugar from that mango candy earlier.  
Hard to say.

---

&gt; &quot;Y'know...&quot; you mutter aloud, turning the juice in your palm thoughtfully, &quot;I've been thinking.&quot;

**Tashigi**, ahead of you, doesn't stop walking.

&gt; &quot;This usually ends in disaster or juice.&quot;

You ignore her-gracefully, of course.

&gt; &quot;What if I could make a kiwi elemental patrol *for* me?&quot;

You gesture vaguely at the rooftops.

&gt; &quot;Like a big citrusy watchdog. Rumbles through alleys. Keeps watch on dark corners. Maybe even hands out juice boxes to kids.&quot;

---

**Tashigi stops.**  
Turns.  
Stares at you.

&gt; &quot;You're serious.&quot;

---

You are.

Well. Mostly.

You look down at your hand, concentrate a little harder... and from your palm, **a wet *bloop*** sound echoes outward.

A small **kiwi-shaped blob** emerges, one stubby arm, a half-face, and two googly juice eyes forming lazily. It stares at you. Then at Tashigi.

Then **wobbles upright**, looking determined.

---

You give it a pat.

&gt; &quot;There. Prototype Mk. I.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Kiwi-Kop.&quot;

---

Tashigi squints at it.

&gt; &quot;...You *named* it?&quot;

&gt; &quot;It doesn't even have legs.&quot;

&gt; &quot;It's *leaking.*&quot;

---

Sure enough, **Kiwi-Kop** begins slowly seeping into the cobblestones as it waddles toward a confused fruit vendor, leaving a faintly green trail behind it like a toddler after a popsicle bath.

The vendor blinks.

&gt; &quot;...Is that supposed to be... helpful?&quot;

---

You raise your arms dramatically.

&gt; &quot;It's *revolutionary civic engagement.*&quot;

---

**Tashigi groans.**  
**The vendor offers Kiwi-Kop a fig.**  
**Kiwi-Kop accepts it by absorbing it into its face.**

---

Despite yourself, you're smiling.

This?  
This is *you now*.  
Not perfect.  
Not polished.  
But *present.*

And dammit-

**Even if your justice leaks citrus, it still shows up.**

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Spend the afternoon testing the Kiwi Elemental's limits-with or without Tashigi's help.}  
2. {Receive a summons: Vivi has requested your presence for a meeting.}  
3. {Split up temporarily: Tashigi to patrol, you to explore your fruit power in peace.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - Do I need to follow an elemental around with a doggy bag and a mop so it doesn't create a slipping hazard everywhere it goes?
I scratch my chin as I continue walking.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Outer City, Citrus Patrol Begins]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Mop and the Myth&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Experimental | Mood: Hilarious Chaos, Discovery, Subtle Growth**

---

You scratch your chin thoughtfully as you watch your glorious citrus spawn **dribble its way down the street like a half-melted parade float**.

**Kiwi-Kop** pauses occasionally to pivot toward barking dogs, shady alleyways, or unattended bread carts with the majestic vigilance of a proud yet *extremely moist* public servant.

You squint.

&gt; &quot;Do I need to follow an elemental around with a mop and a bucket to make sure it's not creating slipping hazards everywhere?&quot;

You take a slow step forward.

**Squish.**

You look down.

&gt; &quot;...Shit.&quot;

---

**Tashigi** doesn't even try to hide the smirk this time.

&gt; &quot;You're going to cause a lawsuit before lunch.&quot;

She pulls a clean cloth from her pocket and flings it at you with expert one-handed precision.

&gt; &quot;Here. You mop. I'll supervise.&quot;

---

You bend over with a groan and **start mopping behind your own sentient juice creation**, which continues waddling confidently toward a back alley with all the purpose of an officer on his beat-and all the **disaster potential of an overripe melon.**

---

Still, as you tail it, your teacher-brain kicks in:

You start taking notes.  
Mental ones.  
Maybe even literal ones in the back of your notebook later.

---

### Observed Kiwi Elemental Behaviors:

- **Autonomous mobility** (very slow)  
- **Basic threat detection** (suspiciously interested in cats, though)  
- **Selective stickiness** (fig pieces cling to it; sand grains do not)  
- **Personality variance** based on juice type-this one? Sweet and polite.  
- **Communication**: Emits a low &quot;bloop&quot; when happy. May also be a warning sign.

---

At one point, Kiwi-Kop lifts one stubby arm and **points at a shady figure loitering near an alleyway fruit stall.**

Tashigi's brow rises.

&gt; &quot;...Was that a gesture?&quot;

You nod slowly.

&gt; &quot;I think so.&quot;

Tashigi tightens her coat, already stepping toward the alley.

&gt; &quot;You're telling me that blob just detected a thief before I did?&quot;

&gt; &quot;*You* trained it?&quot;

You put your hands on your hips proudly, baton hanging lazily at your side.

&gt; &quot;Nope. I parented it.&quot;

---

Tashigi glares at you, then mutters under her breath.

&gt; &quot;I've fought Warlords. I've fought sea monsters. And *this* is what breaks me.&quot;

---

The shady figure notices the attention-starts to bolt.

&gt; &quot;Hey!&quot;

Tashigi **takes off like a bullet.** You follow, your **Kiwi-Kop** waddling behind with what might be a heroic squeaky bloop of support.

---

**OOC:**
Would you like to:

1. {Split off from Tashigi and try to flank the runner with juice tricks.}  
2. {Send Kiwi-Kop to cut the alley and intercept. Might be risky.}  
3. {Stick with Tashigi and back her up-old-fashioned style.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 / 3. Watch Tashigi's back, but send Kiwi Kop to flank. Secrete more juice until Kiwi Kop is about 4 feet high.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Back Alley Pursuit]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Juice Division&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical, Absurdly So | Mood: Fast-Paced, Trust-Forged, Just the Right Amount of Ridiculous**

---

**The suspect bolts**-a flash of cloth, sand-hardened boots pounding against the cobblestones, slicing through narrow gaps between buildings like he's done it before.

**Tashigi's already moving**, her long coat snapping like a banner behind her, sword bouncing lightly against her hip as she charges in full stride.

---

But you?

You peel off sideways.  
Trust in her sword.  
And trust in something far newer, far gooier.

&gt; &quot;Go, Kiwi-Kop. Earn that badge!&quot;

---

You slam your palm to the alley wall.

*BWOOMPF.*

A heavy pulse of emerald liquid bursts from your skin, curling up and around the original **Kiwi-Kop**, feeding into its body in surging, syrup-thick waves. It grows rapidly-**four feet high now**, its arms broadening, its vaguely defined jawline **somehow more heroic.**

A fig seed clinks off its forehead.

&gt; &quot;Bloop,&quot; it grunts, with newfound gravitas.

---

The suspect glances back-

-sees **Tashigi closing in, blade not yet drawn, but *low and ready***-

-then cuts right, aiming to lose her down a narrower pass between two stalls.

**Right where you sent your new recruit.**

---

**Kiwi-Kop barrels around the corner.**  
Not fast.  
But *present.*

Sticky footsteps echo like squelching doom.

---

The thief slows.

Then skids to a halt.

&gt; &quot;What the hell is-&quot;

He plants a foot to change direction-  
**BAD MOVE.**

The cobbles glisten.

Too late.

&gt; *SCHLIP*

The runner's foot flies out from under him-  
He spins-  
**Falls. HARD.**

Right into a puddle of *civic-minded citrus.*

---

You approach just as Tashigi rounds the alley, breathing hard, sword still sheathed.

&gt; &quot;Got eyes on?&quot;

You give her a casual salute with the mop you're still inexplicably carrying.

&gt; &quot;Suspect apprehended by Officer Kop.&quot;

---

She looks past you at the would-be thief-**now groaning on the ground, half-covered in kiwi goo and shame.**

She stares at him.  
Then you.  
Then Kiwi-Kop, who has taken a proud stance on the thief's back like a marshmallow knight conquering a sandbag.

---

&gt; &quot;...Okay,&quot; she mutters.

&gt; &quot;I'll admit it.&quot;

&gt; &quot;That was almost cool.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
You've now confirmed:
- Kiwi Elementals can be **grown, directed**, and used for limited **non-lethal pursuit/intervention.**
- They cause **environmental hazards**. Which you might *absolutely* get fined for later.
- They respond to emotional intent and possibly the thickness/sweetness of your output.
- Tashigi is starting to see them as **functional. Maybe even useful.**

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Interrogate the suspect. Could be Baroque, or just petty crime.}  
2. {Let Tashigi handle the questioning while you debrief Kiwi-Kop.}  
3. {Head back to the palace-Vivi has sent word. There's a civil council meeting forming.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - I spot a nearby Marine office. Hey Tashigi-chan. You got him covered? I've got something to take care of in the office, I'll be right back.

I keep Kiwi Kop to watch Tashigi's back, in an autonomous protection mode. I pray that it's smart enough to distinguish friend from foe, though.

OOC: Give me a window to begin the office scene.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Local Marine Field Office, East Wing]**  
**Scene: &quot;Paperwork and Purpose&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Shift to Serious | Mood: Focused, Curious, Foundations Being Set**

---

**&quot;You got him covered?&quot;**  
You toss the words to Tashigi with an easy tone, but there's a flicker of real meaning beneath them. Trust. Confidence. Shared rhythm.

She gives you a sharp nod without even looking your way, already crouching near the suspect, her sword now drawn-not to threaten, but to *remind*.

&gt; &quot;He twitches, I break a kneecap. Take your time.&quot;

---

**Kiwi-Kop lingers behind.**

Now a respectable 4-foot-tall pillar of semi-solid heroism, its stubby arms cross over its vague chest region. It emits a long, drawn-out &quot;bloop...&quot; like a dog scanning for squirrels.

You murmur to it on your way out:

&gt; &quot;Protect mode. Prioritize Tashigi. No zapping fruit vendors. Please.&quot;

It nods.  
Or at least... jiggles in a vaguely affirmative way.

---

You slip through the side street and step into the **Marine Field Office**, a building still half-under renovation. Scaffolding clings to its southern wall, and a contractor is grumbling at a collapsed filing shelf inside. But despite the mess, the core of the office is intact: maps, mission boards, a Den Den Mushi wall, and desks of overworked, **tired** Marines and local liaisons.

---

The woman at the front desk raises an eyebrow as you walk in, your coat still damp from elemental drippings.

&gt; &quot;Can I... help you, sir?&quot;

Her tone is neutral. Professional. Just a hint of the &quot;please don't track fruit slime across my newly mopped floors&quot; undertone.

---

**OOC: You are now inside the Marine Outpost.**

This location includes:
- Access to **incident logs, bounty records**, and **current deployments**
- **Communication lines** (heavily regulated)
- A growing bulletin board of **community roles and public service notices**
- A few Marines who likely **recognize you**... maybe even from the paper.

---

**You have the floor.**

Would you like to:

1. {Ask about bounty logistics-if Crocodile's bounty is eligible, and if *you* are due a cut.}  
2. {Inquire about joining Alabasta's civilian defense corps officially-now that you've sort of... become one.}  
3. {Look for Smoker-if he's been using this office as a base.}  
4. {Something else entirely. Your call, Sensei.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - So... Do you know how collecting bounties on ex-warlords work? Assuming I'm eligible, at all.

Thinking: Technically I wasn't really fighting him directly, my elemental did. And even then, my elemental was only in a supporting role. Plus Crocodile was fighting a marine and pirate simultaneously. Does it become void since it became a marine operation? Because it could've been considered just pirate on pirate action?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Marine Field Office, Administrative Desk]**  
**Scene: &quot;Bounty Bureaucracy&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Casual Inquiry Meets Legal Confusion | Mood: Mildly Chaotic, Surprisingly Intricate**

---

You lean an elbow on the polished (and recently juice-free) front counter.  
Your coat still smells faintly of kiwi.  
Your back still aches from earlier *heroism*.  
But this? This is the *true* test of a warrior's spirit.

**Paperwork.**

---

&gt; &quot;So...&quot; you begin, keeping your tone level, charming, casual.  
&gt; &quot;How does one go about collecting a bounty on an ex-Warlord?&quot;

The marine clerk doesn't look up yet-she's writing something that involves a lot of angry underlines.

&gt; &quot;Are you asking for legal or ethical reasons?&quot;

You cough.

&gt; &quot;Uh. Financial?&quot;

---

She sighs, then finally looks up and adjusts her glasses.

&gt; &quot;That's a complicated one.&quot;

She opens a drawer and pulls out a thick, coffee-stained folder labeled: **BOUNTY ELIGIBILITY DISPUTES: POST-WARLORD STATUS**  
Inside? You see *dozens* of case summaries, cross-claims, and handwritten addendums marked **PENDING**.

---

&gt; &quot;Okay,&quot; she begins, in a tone that says *you're going to regret asking*,  
&gt; &quot;Bounty eligibility on revoked Warlords depends on several factors:&quot;

---

She ticks off her fingers:

**&quot;One.&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Did the individual have a government-issued bounty prior to, or after, their Warlord status was revoked?&quot;

**&quot;Two.&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Were they apprehended or defeated in a recognized anti-criminal operation?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;If Marines were involved, claims often default to Marine oversight.&quot;

**&quot;Three.&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Was the contribution to the defeat **measurable, significant, and direct**?&quot;

She gives you a once-over, eyes lingering on the juice stains on your coat.

&gt; &quot;You look like you did something weird. So maybe.&quot;

---

You raise a tentative hand.

&gt; &quot;Uh... what if it was more like...&quot;

&gt; &quot;...A *giant fruit elemental* did most of the heavy lifting while I lay unconscious in a public square?&quot;

She pauses. Pen hovers mid-air.

&gt; &quot;...Like a summoned creature?&quot;

You nod.

She scribbles something.

&gt; &quot;*Possible 'Proxy Combatant Clause' Invocation.*&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;Also,&quot; you add, &quot;he was also being punched by a pirate and fisted by a marine at the time. Like, simultaneously.&quot;

She doesn't even blink.

&gt; &quot;Then you'll want subsection 4.3: *âShared Contribution in Mixed Criminal-Justice Action Events.'*&quot;

---

You blink.

&gt; &quot;...Does that cancel the bounty?&quot;

She shrugs.

&gt; &quot;Not always. Sometimes it just *splits* it.&quot;

&gt; &quot;If Smoker files a claim, it becomes Marine property. If Straw Hat Luffy files one, it might be rejected since he's a pirate. If **neither** files, and you get there first...&quot;

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;Well. You *might* get a cut.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;How much of a cut?&quot;

She slams down a stack of fine print marked:  
**âUP TO X BERRI' DOES NOT GUARANTEE X BERRI'**

&gt; &quot;Ever hear of *processing fees, maritime deduction taxes,* and *payout delay clauses*?&quot;

---

You slowly step back from the counter.

She pats the folder.

&gt; &quot;But hey. If you really want to file... we can start your paperwork now.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Estimated processing time is...&quot;  
She flips a page.

&gt; &quot;...14 to 18 months. Assuming you survive the first audit.&quot;

---

**OOC:**
You now understand that collecting on **Crocodile's bounty** is:

- *Technically possible*
- *Incredibly bureaucratic*
- *Likely to be contested*
- *May end in you receiving a novelty check for 7,000 Berri and a coupon for a free government-issue protein bar*

Would you like to:

1. {File the bounty claim anyway. It's the principle of the thing.}  
2. {Decline to file, and maybe try to cash in some palace goodwill later instead.}  
3. {Ask about registering your fruit officially with the World Government (a risky move).}  
4. {Ask to see Smoker, if he's present.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - ...can I see how much paperwork is involved first?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Marine Field Office - Administrative Abyss]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Filing Gauntlet&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Slow-Motion Horror | Mood: Bureaucratic Nightmare with Citrus Undertones**

---

The clerk narrows her eyes, lips quirking into something between amusement and pity.

&gt; &quot;You sure?&quot;

You pause.

Then-like a man about to open **Pandora's Filing Cabinet**-you nod solemnly.

&gt; &quot;Just... show me how much paperwork we're talking about.&quot;

---

She reaches beneath the desk, opens a deep drawer, and with the dramatic flair of someone who's seen *too many idealists perish at the hands of bureaucracy*, pulls out a **stack of forms**.

Not one folder.

Not two.

**Six.**

Each a different color.  
Each bearing a different set of seals, acronyms, and terrifyingly vague footnotes.

---

She slaps them down, one by one:

---

1. **Form W-BT-004** - *Revocation Adjustment Confirmation*  
&gt; &quot;Verifies that the bounty remained active during revocation transition.&quot;

2. **Form M-JT-872** - *Marine Joint Engagement Clause*  
&gt; &quot;Outlines how many Marines were present, their contributions, and why they didn't get the kill first.&quot;

3. **Form C-XP-666** - *Civilian Proxy Combatant Declaration*  
&gt; &quot;You sign this, you declare yourself âprimarily responsible' for any and all juice-related damages in a 10-mile radius.&quot;

4. **Form P-KI-399** - *Paramecia-Based Summon Proxy Filing*  
&gt; &quot;Covers entities born of fruit-based consciousness that act on the user's behalf.&quot;  
&gt; (Scrawled on the top: *DOES NOT APPLY TO WHIPPED CREAM OR JAM-TYPE ABILITIES*)

5. **Form B-REV-404** - *Bounty Revenue Share Petition*  
&gt; &quot;Used to request payment from multiple parties' shared defeat. Must include *witness testimony,* medical reports, and fruit residue samples.&quot;

6. **Form X-VOID-UNL** - *World Government Exception Liability Waiver*  
&gt; &quot;In case the claim is rejected and you want to avoid being fined for impersonating a bounty hunter with insufficient credentials.&quot;

---

She finishes the display with a flourish.

Then slowly pushes a pen across the desk.

&gt; &quot;Page count comes to around... two hundred and seventy-six. Including appendices.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Ink not included.&quot;

---

You stare at it.

You stare at her.

You stare at the pen.

---

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;Still want to file, Sensei?&quot;

---

**OOC: Final Decision Time -**

Do you:

1. {Take the forms. The pain will be real-but so is the possibility of payoff, even if symbolic.}  
2. {Back away slowly. &quot;On second thought, I'll just stick to government-funded housing and palace tea.&quot;}  
3. {Grab just one form-*maybe* the Paramecia declaration-for curiosity's sake.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - ...is there a deadline on filing? I can try filling out... A page a night?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Marine Field Office - Welcome to the Grind]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Paper Path to Glory&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Committed | Mood: Mundane Heroism, Humor Meets Dread**

---

You eye the mountain of forms.  
It eyes you back.

Two hundred and seventy-six pages.  
Ink not included.  
Your soul? *Probably optional.*

---

&gt; &quot;...Is there a deadline on filing?&quot; you ask, voice quiet like a man asking a doctor how many weeks he has left.

The clerk taps the top form, **Form W-BT-004**, with a perfectly manicured nail.

&gt; &quot;One month from the date of Warlord revocation to file your initial intent.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Three months to submit full documentation.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Or, y'know, until someone else claims they beat Crocodile first and wins the rights to bragging and whatever's left of his buried fortune.&quot;

---

You squint.

&gt; &quot;That *sounds* like enough time...&quot;

&gt; &quot;If I fill out... one page a night?&quot;

You pause.

&gt; &quot;Two if I skip dinner.&quot;

She shrugs.

&gt; &quot;The Marines call it *âearning your retirement with carpal tunnel.'*&quot;

---

She hands you a folder.

No ceremony. No music. Just **the weight of your own optimism** in slightly damp, government-issued parchment.

&gt; &quot;Take it home, Sensei.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And don't forget: ink must be **blue.** Black is for Marines. Red is for war crimes.&quot;

---

You hold the forms like they might bite.

Behind you, a younger Marine whispers to his desk partner:

&gt; &quot;Is that the juice guy?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yeah, I think he *fought a Warlord* and now he's filing for reimbursement like it's laundry day.&quot;

---

You don't respond.

You just tuck the folder under your arm, straighten your spine-

And head back into the light of day.

Because **this** is your legacy now:

**Battle-scarred protector. Educator of youth.  
Filer of paperwork.**

---

**OOC:**
You've officially started the **Bounty Claim Side Quest**  
(Estimated Time to Completion: 1-3 in-game months, or 6-8 long rests of miserable scribbling)

You may now:

1. {Return to the patrol with Tashigi and Kiwi-Kop.}  
2. {Check in with Vivi-the civil council meeting has likely begun.}  
3. {Take a break. Gods know, you've earned it.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - I slip the papers into the bookbag slung over my shoulder.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Back Alley, Rejoining the Patrol]**  
**Scene: &quot;Pulp and Procedure&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Balanced | Mood: Light Resolve, Rhythm Returning**

---

The papers slide smoothly into the worn bookbag at your hip-**nestling in between old lesson plans, a half-crushed emergency granola bar, and a ballpoint pen with suspiciously little ink left.** You pat the side of the bag like a parent sealing a lunchbox.

&gt; &quot;One page a night,&quot; you mutter.

&gt; &quot;Two if I skip breakfast.&quot;

Pause.

&gt; &quot;...Three if I get fired anyway.&quot;

---

You step back onto the sunbaked cobblestone, rounding the corner toward the alley you left behind.

There they are.

**Tashigi's finishing the paperwork** (ironic, given your new burden), and **Kiwi-Kop stands vigilant** like a green gelatinous gargoyle-arms crossed, leaking modestly onto a stray cat, which doesn't seem to mind.

The suspect is tied, slumped, grumbling.

&gt; &quot;Tell your fruit slime it stepped on my dignity.&quot;

You point to the puddle near him.

&gt; &quot;Tell your dignity not to be so absorbent.&quot;

---

**Tashigi straightens**, brushing dust off her sleeve. Her brow rises as you reappear, the bureaucratic stink of paperwork still faintly radiating from your coat.

&gt; &quot;You good?&quot;

You nod.

&gt; &quot;Yep. Begun the noble journey of Warlord Bounty Claim Filing Protocol Section 8-B. A hero's path.&quot;

Tashigi rolls her eyes.

&gt; &quot;Next thing I know you'll be issuing citations for sidewalk slippage.&quot;

---

**Kiwi-Kop emits a deep &quot;bloop.&quot;**  
It seems... supportive.

You all stand there a moment.  
The tension of the morning-gone.  
The rhythm of rebuilding-resuming.

---

You take your baton in hand.  
You adjust your bag.  
The pages rustle once as they settle into place.

---

**You're not a warlord. Not a pirate. Not a soldier.**

You're just **you**.

But in a city full of cracks and children and quiet danger,  
**you're enough.**

---

**OOC: The day continues.**

Would you like to:

1. {Join the civil council with Vivi-policy, recovery, and long-term reconstruction.}  
2. {Continue patrolling with Tashigi through the refugee quarter. Rumors of unrest stir there.}  
3. {Take a moment to yourself. Explore your power more deeply-maybe test elemental variations.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - I frown at the juice dripping off Kiwi Kop, starting to flood the nearest sewer grate.

Maybe... I should try this in a more... Permeable part of town next time. I desummon the elemental.

**Scene: &quot;Cleanup on Aisle Kop&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Self-Aware | Mood: Reflective, Functional, Slightly Slippery**

---

You glance down at **Kiwi-Kop**, who has taken to mimicking your posture with uncanny accuracy-one squishy arm raised thoughtfully, the other leaking slightly over the top of a storm grate that's now gurgling with concern.

A poor city maintenance worker further down the street glares at the bubbling runoff, visibly calculating the number of buckets and curse words this cleanup will take.

You wince.

&gt; &quot;Yeah... we probably shouldn't be letting law enforcement ooze into the plumbing.&quot;

---

With a sigh, you focus.

A familiar tug curls behind your navel-part instinct, part exhaustion, and part resignation that *maybe* not all parts of justice are biodegradable.

You hold out your hand.

&gt; &quot;Alright, buddy. Good shift. Time to clock out.&quot;

---

**Kiwi-Kop emits a long, drawn-out &quot;bloo-&quot;**

And **dissolves.**

With a polite *plop.*

A citrus-scented splash paints the cobblestones where it stood.

A single fig seed rolls into a crack and nestles there, as if in memory.

---

Tashigi, watching from a few feet away, crosses her arms and raises a brow.

&gt; &quot;So... fruit magic cleanup duty is part of your job now too?&quot;

You adjust your coat, now slightly less sticky.

&gt; &quot;Occupational hazard of being a teacher-slash-vigilante. Also, I'm pretty sure I violated at least three environmental ordinances just now.&quot;

---

She chuckles-*actually chuckles*-and falls in beside you.

---

The sun continues rising higher.

The scent of fresh bread and market fruit wafts in from a nearby plaza.  
The echoes of rebuilding sound out from the rooftops above.

And you?

You're *still here*.

**No longer just reacting to chaos.**  
Now? You're *directing* something.

Even if it leaks.

---

**OOC: Where to next, Sensei?**

1. {Join Vivi at the palace for the civil council session. Begin long-term recovery planning.}  
2. {Continue patrol-head toward the refugee zone. Possible Baroque sympathizers have been sighted.}  
3. {Test your fruit deeper-explore new elemental variations in a private location.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - You know, I know we ended up capturing Crocodile, but what happened to his other officers? All Sunday disappeared, and we never properly apprehended the ones back at the Sandora river.

**Scene: &quot;The Unfinished Ends&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Uneasy Calm, Seeds of Future Conflict**

---

You and **Tashigi** walk along the narrow wall that overlooks Alubarna's eastern quarter-below, rooftops stretch like plates laid out for a feast the kingdom hasn't quite prepared for yet. Workers hammer at scaffolds, smoke coils lazily from repaired chimneys, and **hope cautiously returns to its perch**.

And yet...

**You frown.**

It's not the rebuilding that nags at you.  
It's the silence.

&gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; you murmur, lowering your voice.

&gt; &quot;I know we captured Crocodile. Slammed him in enough citrus to pickle him for a week.&quot;

You glance sideways at her.

&gt; &quot;But what happened to the rest of Baroque Works?&quot;

---

**Tashigi slows**, the wind tugging lightly at her coat. She doesn't answer right away.

You keep going.

&gt; &quot;I mean... Miss All Sunday? She disappeared in the chaos.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Mr. 1 and Miss Doublefinger were still fighting Zoro and Nami last I saw-do we know if they were *actually* apprehended?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Mr. 2-Bon Clay-might have escaped in the confusion too.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And the agents at the Sandora River... Mr. 4, Miss Merry Christmas...&quot;

You trail off.

&gt; &quot;We *won*. But we didn't *finish.*&quot;

---

Tashigi nods grimly.

&gt; &quot;We know.&quot;

Her eyes narrow.

&gt; &quot;Miss All Sunday hasn't been sighted since Crocodile's capture. It's like she vanished with the wind.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Some say she was *never truly part of Baroque Works.* Just an opportunist.&quot;

You arch a brow.

&gt; &quot;Pretty powerful opportunist, for someone who read the Poneglyph like it was bedtime poetry.&quot;

---

She sighs.

&gt; &quot;As for the others...&quot;

&gt; &quot;We've confirmed that some of Crocodile's officers escaped. Mr. 2's last known appearance was on the outer edge of Alubarna, near a civilian convoy. After that-gone.&quot;

&gt; &quot;No bodies. No arrests. Just empty footprints in the sand.&quot;

---

Her voice tightens-not with panic, but with something colder:

&gt; &quot;It's not over.&quot;

---

You look out over the city, watching a little boy chasing a lizard with a paintbrush, laughing as he misses every swing.

&gt; &quot;They're going to regroup.&quot;

Tashigi nods again.

&gt; &quot;They'll lie low. Regrow their masks. Build something smaller, smarter, meaner.&quot;

She looks at you fully.

&gt; &quot;Maybe not here. Maybe not soon. But somewhere.&quot;

---

A pause.

&gt; &quot;That's why we stay.&quot;

You nod, once.

---

**OOC: Here are the confirmed fates so far:**

- **Crocodile:** In Marine custody, imprisoned pending extradition to Impel Down.  
- **Miss All Sunday (Nico Robin):** Missing. Escaped during Crocodile's downfall.  
- **Mr. 1 &amp; Miss Doublefinger:** Fate unclear. Possibly escaped in the confusion after the rebel battle.  
- **Mr. 2 (Bon Clay):** Escaped capture. Last seen aiding civilians-may not be hostile, but unpredictable.  
- **Mr. 4 &amp; Miss Merry Christmas:** Unconfirmed. Their battle site was destroyed during the elemental eruption. Possibly buried, possibly gone.  
- **Lower Agents:** Several arrested. Many remain at large. Baroque's network was deep.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Request access to Baroque Works dossiers to investigate their structure-maybe help track them down?}  
2. {Plan with Tashigi to form a civilian task force-trained eyes in every quarter of Alubarna.}  
3. {Let it sit for now, and move forward with your day-there's enough to handle in the present.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - I might need to need to learn how to keep Kiwi Kop active while I sleep. Wouldn't want to get my throat slit in bed by some vengeful Baroque boy or girl.

---

You lean against the worn stone ledge, arms crossed loosely as the shadows grow long across the city. The sun dips lower, dragging Alabarna into a golden hush. It's peaceful now.

*Too* peaceful.

---

&gt; &quot;You know,&quot; you mutter aloud, &quot;I might need to figure out how to keep Kiwi-Kop active while I sleep.&quot;

Tashigi doesn't respond immediately.  
Just tilts her head slightly.

&gt; &quot;You expecting trouble?&quot;

You scan the skyline.  
Watch two hawks wheel over the merchant district.  
Feel the ache in your ribs from the cannon blast that nearly turned you into pulp.  
Feel the still-fresh memory of **Baroque agents** slithering like ghosts beneath the foundation of a kingdom.

---

&gt; &quot;I'm not *expecting* it,&quot; you admit.  
&gt; &quot;But I've seen enough to know the world doesn't hand out happy endings.&quot;

You exhale, slow and measured.

&gt; &quot;Wouldn't take much. One bitter leftover with a blade and a grudge. I'm not hard to find. Hell, I filed paperwork under my real name.&quot;

Tashigi snorts softly.

&gt; &quot;You're dramatic.&quot;

---

You turn your head slightly.

&gt; &quot;You ever worry about it?&quot;

She looks at you sharply.

You clarify.

&gt; &quot;When you sleep. When you're off-duty. That someone might try and finish the job they started?&quot;

---

A beat.

&gt; &quot;Every night,&quot; she says.

---

That silence stretches again.

Not lonely.

Just honest.

---

You hold up your hand, conjuring a faint, humming orb of **juice-light**, swirling lazily in your palm like sap infused with the last breath of summer.

&gt; &quot;I think... maybe if I keep the elemental small. Less mass. Lower drain.&quot;

&gt; &quot;More of a warden. A lookout.&quot;

You glance at her.

&gt; &quot;Think I can train it to wake me if someone tries anything?&quot;

---

Tashigi watches the juice swirl.

&gt; &quot;That's not a fruit technique.&quot;

&gt; &quot;That's a survival instinct.&quot;

&gt; &quot;And probably the most responsible damn idea I've heard today.&quot;

---

She pauses, then adds, almost offhand:

&gt; &quot;When you figure it out... show me. Might be useful for others like you.&quot;

She hesitates.

&gt; &quot;Like *us.*&quot;

---

The silence after that?

Feels less haunted.

---

**OOC: You've unlocked a new personal goal:**

### **[Passive Summoning - Subconscious Kiwi Construct]**

&gt; You may now begin experimenting with a small, low-energy elemental variant designed for **nighttime defense and alarm detection**.

Attributes may include:
- Limited lifespan (~2-4 hours unattended)  
- Heightened sensory awareness during your unconscious state  
- &quot;Ping&quot; alert upon perceived threat  
- Autonomous dissolve if attacked or overtaxed

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Begin working on a prototype tonight-experiment with fruit output before sleep.}  
2. {Head back to the palace and check in with Vivi before the day ends.}  
3. {Wrap patrol, grab dinner with Tashigi, decompress. Just a little.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - You know any good kebab places? I was told of a few in Rainbase, but I never had the time to try them out. Because... Y'know.

**Tone: Low Flame Warmth | Mood: Quiet Companionship, End-of-Day Softness**

---

&gt; &quot;You know any good kebab places?&quot;

Your words break the long silence as you and Tashigi descend from the wall, boots tapping against sandstone steps smoothed by generations.

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;Now?&quot;

You give her a tired shrug, twirling your baton lazily over one shoulder.

&gt; &quot;I was told about a few back in Rainbase, but, uh... things got *complicated*.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Hard to critique spice balance when someone's trying to drop a warlord on your face.&quot;

---

Tashigi actually snorts. It's small, barely there, but it's real.

&gt; &quot;There's a spot near the artisan quarter,&quot; she says, motioning for you to follow as you turn down a narrow, cobbled side street. &quot;It's old. Family-run. Still standing even after the siege.&quot;

&gt; &quot;The kind of place that doesn't *look* like much.&quot;

She glances sideways.

&gt; &quot;But then again... neither do you.&quot;

---

You bow exaggeratedly, nearly tripping on a loose brick.

&gt; &quot;I'll pretend that was a compliment.&quot;

---

**The alley opens up to a tucked-away stall**, half-lit by firelight and strung with makeshift lanterns. The scent hits you instantly:

**Charred lamb, sizzling spice, toasted cumin, fresh mint, and just a whisper of tangy yogurt.**

The grill sizzles behind a short man with a scar like a map across his face and a metal tong clenched in a hand that's probably seen battle. He gives Tashigi a subtle nod-like they've been here before. She responds with an equally subtle lean against the ordering counter.

&gt; &quot;The usual,&quot; she says.

&gt; &quot;And something for my... tag-along.&quot;

---

&gt; &quot;With extra garlic,&quot; you add. &quot;I want to repel any assassins with breath alone tonight.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Proactive defense.&quot;

---

He grunts. Begins flipping meat.

A few moments pass in the comfort of glowing coals and the soft buzz of nighttime Alubarna.

Children laugh from a nearby table.  
Someone plays a lute two streets over.  
You take a seat on a tilted crate and watch Tashigi as she exhales slowly, letting the tension roll off her like steam.

---

You murmur, half-sincere:

&gt; &quot;So is this your way of saying you care?&quot;

She looks at you. Then hands you a wrapped skewer of blistered lamb and grilled dates.

&gt; &quot;This is my way of not listening to you complain on an empty stomach.&quot;

---

You both dig in.

And for a few minutes?

The world isn't broken.

The war is over.  
The kids are safe.  
The kebabs are perfect.

And somewhere in the distance, a fig seed rolls across a cobblestone.

---

**OOC: You've formed a new bond with Tashigi -**  
**&quot;Sword &amp; Citrus - A Comrade's Comfort&quot;**

She won't say it aloud. But today?  
You were the right partner to have at her side.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Talk about anything deeper over the kebabs-loss, legacy, justice.}  
2. {Keep it light. Trade stories, maybe even smile.}  
3. {Just eat. In the quiet. Side by side. Let that be enough.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - So, what's your CO up to these days? Any new orders coming in from HQ? 

OOC: Smoker is leading reconstruction from the Marine side. He has also received word that he's getting a promotion to Commodore for &quot;single handedly saving Alabasta from Crocodile&quot;, as said in the news - something he's angrily trying to correct the record on. Secretly, he's also put in a request to promote Tashigi to Ensign and got it approved, something he plans to surprise her with at the next opportunity.

---

You're two bites into the most absurdly well-spiced lamb skewer of your life when you tilt your head Tashigi's way, grease on your fingers, a trace of smoke still curling from the kebab stand behind you.

&gt; &quot;So... what's your CO up to these days?&quot;

You say it casually-like you're asking about the weather. But she stiffens slightly. Not tension exactly, just... formality. Even in kebab mode.

&gt; &quot;Any new orders coming in from HQ?&quot;

---

Tashigi takes a moment to chew, swallows, then dabs the corner of her mouth with the inside of her glove.  
Because she's Tashigi, and of course she does.

&gt; &quot;Captain Smoker's been working with palace liaisons. Coordinating reconstruction. Reestablishing jurisdiction zones. Un-burying Marine barracks that were crushed by Bananagators.&quot;

She says the last part with a deadpan so dry it could sand a table.

---

&gt; &quot;He hates it,&quot; she adds after a beat. &quot;He's not a desk guy. Watching civilians walk past the rubble when he can't help every single one of them-it's eating him up.&quot;

She glances to the side, expression tightening for a second.

&gt; &quot;...But he's still showing up. Every day. Without fail.&quot;

---

You nod slowly.

&gt; &quot;Sounds like someone I know.&quot;

She doesn't respond. Just takes another bite and avoids eye contact.

---

But then... a sly flicker of something glints in her eye. Something unspoken. She leans in a bit, elbow resting on the crate between you.

&gt; &quot;Also...&quot;

She drops her voice, almost conspiratorially:

&gt; &quot;He's fuming over some nonsense the *World Economy News* printed.&quot;

You tilt your head.

&gt; &quot;The one where they said he *single-handedly defeated Crocodile* and *saved the entire country by himself*?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Yeah. Saw that.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Did he throw the paper?&quot;

&gt; &quot;He threw the paper. Then lit it on fire. Then kicked it into the river.&quot;

---

You both laugh.

It's a little too loud for the quiet corner of the market.

You don't apologize.

---

Tashigi shifts slightly, more relaxed now. There's something satisfied in her posture, like the burdens of command are a little lighter here, skewers in hand, no reports to write.

&gt; &quot;He's pretending not to know,&quot; she says softly, &quot;but HQ's promoting him.&quot;

You raise an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;Really? Commodore?&quot;

She nods.

&gt; &quot;Won't admit it. Keeps trying to correct the record, send in rebuttals. They keep printing the same headline.&quot;

&gt; &quot;âHero of Alabasta.'&quot;

---

You whistle.

&gt; &quot;Think he's gonna start carrying business cards with that on it?&quot;

Tashigi snorts into her drink.

&gt; &quot;Not unless the back says âShut Up and Move.'&quot;

---

A pause.

The firelight flickers.

&gt; &quot;...He also put in a promotion request for me.&quot;

Her voice is quieter now. Not sheepish. Just... surprised. Grateful. A little vulnerable.

&gt; &quot;Didn't tell me.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But I caught the draft before it got filed.&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;That's some detective work.&quot;

She shrugs.

&gt; &quot;Ensign's not that big a jump.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;But it means he trusts me.&quot;

---

You raise your skewer like a glass.

&gt; &quot;To Ensign Tashigi.&quot;

She raises hers in kind.

&gt; &quot;To Mister Pineapple, Slayer of Crocodiles and Inventor of Non-Lethal Fruit Golems.&quot;

---

You clink kebabs.  
It is, unquestionably, the most **Alabastan toast** imaginable.

---

**OOC: Your bond with Tashigi has deepened.**  
She's allowing herself moments of *relaxation* around you now.  
Of vulnerability. Of human connection, outside the Marine code.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Walk her back to the palace. A quiet end to a long day.}  
2. {Head to the training fields-test your new elemental alarm idea. She might even want to spar.}  
3. {Ask her something more personal-you've never had a better moment.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - You know, you really know your way around with that sword of yours. We should spar sometime. Always wanted to pick up a few tricks. I gesture at my baton.

All this? Self taught. Martial art books at the local library, and a class at an old people's home about &quot;defending yourself from the less elderly.&quot; I think ended up getting a yellow belt in some art, I don't even know which, or what it means.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - Returning from the Market District]**  
**Scene: &quot;A Walk, a Wandering Blade, and the Secret Yellow Belt&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Intimate, Self-Deprecating Warmth, a Hint of Affection in the Air**

---

The market's glow falls behind you both, replaced by the **cool hush of moonlit alleys**, the flicker of lanterns, the distant calls of guards doing their rounds. You're walking back shoulder to shoulder, the kebabs long gone, but the sense of warmth lingering like the tang of spice on your tongue.

---

&gt; &quot;You know,&quot; you begin, spinning your collapsed baton lazily in one hand,  
&gt; &quot;You really know your way around with that sword of yours.&quot;

**Tashigi**, who'd been quietly enjoying the rare sound of peace, gives a faint side-smile.

&gt; &quot;...That's the nicest way anyone's ever said âyou nearly stabbed me the first time we met.'&quot;

---

You smirk, lifting your hands in mock innocence.

&gt; &quot;It's a compliment!&quot;

&gt; &quot;I mean it. We should spar sometime.&quot;

You jab your baton outward like it's a fencing foil. It whistles through the air with... enthusiasm, if not elegance.

---

&gt; &quot;Always wanted to pick up a few tricks.&quot;

You pause, tapping the side of your head.

&gt; &quot;Everything I know came from self-study. Martial arts books at the local library. And one community class at a retirement home.&quot;

She stares.

You nod, solemn.

&gt; &quot;Taught by a 93-year-old woman named Lady Riko. The class was called *âDefend Yourself from the Less Elderly.'*&quot;

---

Tashigi makes a sound-somewhere between a cough and a laugh-trying and failing to contain the grin stretching across her face.

&gt; &quot;You're joking.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'm not.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...You *are.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;I got a yellow belt!&quot; you declare proudly.

&gt; &quot;...In something.&quot;

You shrug.

&gt; &quot;I don't remember what. It had a very long name and some of it might've been misprinted.&quot;

---

Tashigi shakes her head slowly, clearly torn between admiration and secondhand embarrassment.

&gt; &quot;And now you're fighting Warlords.&quot;

You tap your temple.

&gt; &quot;All thanks to Riko-sensei.&quot;

&gt; &quot;She once disarmed an armed robber using only a loaded dice set and sheer disappointment.&quot;

---

You both laugh again.

It echoes off the walls of the city, under the stars.

---

**You reach the palace steps**, the guards nodding at your approach, familiar now with your face-even if your reputation shifts daily between *hero*, *tourist*, *walking fruit punch*, and *marine-adjacent mop wielder.*

---

Tashigi pauses before heading in.

&gt; &quot;...We can spar.&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;Wait, really?&quot;

She looks at you sideways.

&gt; &quot;Tomorrow morning. Training yard. Dawn.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I want to see if that yellow belt is real.&quot;

---

You flash a grin.

&gt; &quot;Only if you promise not to go full death-blade on me.&quot;

She scoffs.

&gt; &quot;No promises.&quot;

---

She disappears through the corridor with a rustle of coat and scabbard.

You're left on the steps a moment longer, staring out into the calm of a kingdom you helped save.

---

**OOC:**
Tomorrow morning-**sparring session unlocked**.  
Whether you learn something useful... or just get thoroughly bruised... depends on your choices.

But tonight?

Tonight, you rest.  
Kiwi juice in your blood, kebabs in your belly, and a **very confusing yellow belt legacy** tucked somewhere in your soul.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Head to your room and try to prototype your elemental alarm before sleep.}  
2. {Take a walk through the palace gardens. Perhaps you're not the only one awake.}  
3. {Turn in early. You've got a duel at dawn, Sensei.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - I wonder how Vivi's day went. Wander around.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Moonlit Gardens]**  
**Scene: &quot;Petals, Promises, and a Princess at Peace&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Serene, Soft Reflection, A Quiet Thread of Intimacy**

---

You peel away from the palace's main hallway, choosing a quieter route-one that winds between moon-drenched stone columns and down into the **palace gardens**, where moonflowers sway open in the night air and the sound of distant fountains whispers like someone telling secrets to the breeze.

**The stone under your feet is warm from the day.**  
The scent of cactus blossoms and imported jasmine lingers just enough to soften your nerves.

---

You let your legs lead you, a mix of idle curiosity and gentle concern curling in your chest.

&gt; *Wonder how she's doing...*

---

You turn a corner-

-and there she is.

---

**Vivi**, seated on a low marble bench beneath the canopy of a **crooked flowering date tree**, her arms wrapped around one knee, the other leg stretched long across the stone.

Her slippers are off, her royal sash discarded beside her. She wears a simple cotton wrap, pale blue and soft like the dusk sky. Her hair is loose, **ruffled by the wind**, and there's a half-eaten fig on the tray beside her, untouched for what looks like a while.

Her eyes are closed. But her brow isn't peaceful.

She's thinking. Deeply.

---

You hesitate at the edge of the garden path.

She senses you anyway.

&gt; &quot;Couldn't sleep either?&quot; she asks softly, eyes still closed.

---

You shuffle forward, boots quieter than they've ever been in your life.

&gt; &quot;I was wondering how your day went.&quot;

A small, tired smile curls at her lips. She opens one eye, then the other. Her voice is barely above the rustling leaves.

&gt; &quot;Busy.&quot;

A pause.

&gt; &quot;Everyone wants something. A treaty signed. A road repaved. A sibling found. A father reassured.&quot;

Another pause.

&gt; &quot;Some people just want me to still be the girl I was before.&quot;

She opens her eyes fully now.

&gt; &quot;That girl doesn't exist anymore.&quot;

---

You lower yourself onto the far end of the bench. Not too close. But close enough.

&gt; &quot;I think she's still in there,&quot; you say, after a beat. &quot;She just has... better armor now.&quot;

Vivi lets out a quiet, shaky laugh.

&gt; &quot;I think she traded the armor for war paint.&quot;

---

The garden falls into a silence again.

But it's different from before.  
Not sad. Not strained.  
Just... two people **sharing a pause**, under stars they both nearly didn't live to see.

---

&gt; &quot;You staying?&quot; she asks, not looking at you this time.

You blink.

&gt; &quot;In the palace?&quot;

&gt; &quot;In Alabasta.&quot;

You don't answer right away.

So she glances at you, head tilted slightly, as if to say:

**âI won't push. But I need to know.'**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Be honest. You still don't know-but part of you wants to.}  
2. {Say yes. Say you're staying-at least for a while.}  
3. {Answer with a question: &quot;Do you want me to?&quot;}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Yeah, I was going to stay, at least until reconstruction in Alubarna is complete. (Clueless) Make sure no roofs fall on you when you're walking the town, you know 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace Gardens - Under the Date Tree]**  
**Scene: &quot;Anchored in Citrus and Stone&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Soft | Mood: Deepening Connection, Gentle Relief**

---

You scratch the back of your neck, eyes drifting toward the moonlit trellises and the vines hanging from the old stonework like memories yet to be sorted.

&gt; &quot;Yeah,&quot; you say, casual. Honest. Like it's the simplest truth in the world.  
&gt; &quot;I was going to stay.&quot;

You glance toward her, a shrug pulling at one shoulder.

&gt; &quot;At least until reconstruction in Alubarna's done. Got to make sure no roofs fall on you when you're walking through town, y'know.&quot;

You add a slight grin at the end, trying to keep the tone light. Clueless to the weight of your words.

But **Vivi doesn't laugh**.

Not right away.

She just... looks at you. Really looks.

---

Her eyes aren't watery.  
They're **clear**.  
Steady.

But there's something in the way her hands curl lightly in her lap-  
The way her shoulders lower-  
The way her chest lifts with the first **real exhale** she's probably taken all day.

---

&gt; &quot;You always say things like that,&quot; she says.

Her voice is soft.

&gt; &quot;Like they're nothing.&quot;

---

You blink.

&gt; &quot;Like what?&quot;

She turns her head toward you, moonlight pooling in her hair like a second crown.

&gt; &quot;Like you don't realize how rare it is to hear them.&quot;

---

There's a quiet moment.

A cool breeze pushes through the trees.

Somewhere nearby, a guard yawns.  
A fox stirs near the garden wall.

But here-under this crooked date tree-it's just you two.

---

She smiles.

Genuinely.

&gt; &quot;Thank you.&quot;

A pause.

Then, with more playfulness than before:

&gt; &quot;Though if a roof does fall on me, I'm holding you personally accountable.&quot;

You hold up a hand.

&gt; &quot;Fair. I'll file an apology form with the Marine Civil Engineering Department. Might take a year.&quot;

---

The quiet laughter shared now is easier.  
No longer defensive.  
No longer tired.  
Just... soft. Real.

---

**OOC: You've gained another layer to your bond with Vivi -**  
**&quot;A Rooftop Promise: An Anchor in Rebuilding&quot;**

Where others may come and go with victory banners or headlines,  
**you stayed.**

And **she noticed.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask her how she's really feeling-about the future, the war, her place in it all.}  
2. {Tell her goodnight, and return to your room to prepare for your dawn spar.}  
3. {Say nothing else. Just sit beside her, until the moon begins to dip.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Once it gets late enough, get up and pat her head.

Don't stay up too late, blue. You're still in your growing years, unlike me.

Head towards my room for a well deserved bath and rest.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Garden Departure]**  
**Scene: &quot;A Pat, a Parting, and a Promise in Passing&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tender | Mood: Contentment, Quiet Caring, A Soft Night Close**

---

The minutes stretch in peaceful silence. The kind of silence only people who've suffered together-and chosen to heal-can share. The moon arcs gently overhead, brushing the rooftops with silver. You don't say a word, and neither does she.

You sit beside her until the garden begins to yawn with the earliest signs of deep night.

Then, slowly, you rise.

The wooden bench creaks softly beneath your absence, and Vivi's head turns lazily to follow your movement.

You pause, eyes on her for just a beat longer.

Then you reach out, casually-  
And rest your hand lightly atop her crown of wind-tousled hair.

She freezes.

---

&gt; &quot;Don't stay up too late, Blue,&quot; you murmur, voice warm, teasing.  
&gt; &quot;You're still in your growing years.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Unlike me.&quot;

---

She doesn't say anything.

But her head doesn't flinch away, either.  
Her hand lifts briefly, touches your wrist in return-  
A silent *thank you*, and a quiet *stay safe* all wrapped into a moment small enough to miss if you weren't looking for it.

You don't make it a big thing. You never do.

You just turn with a slight wave, and walk off into the palace corridors.

---

The marble floor cools beneath your boots as you move.  
Your room greets you with flickering candlelight, the scent of fresh linen, and the faint hiss of **steaming bathwater** waiting.

Your coat hits the hook.  
The bag of bounty paperwork hits the desk with a damp thump.  
And you?

You slide into the water like a man claiming his **hard-earned reward**.

---

**OOC:**
You've concluded your second day in post-war Alubarna.

**The city is healing.  
You are healing.  
And whether you know it or not...  
They've started to depend on you.**

---

**Rest Well, Sensei.  
You've got a duel at dawn.**

Would you like to:

1. {Sleep immediately. Wake at dawn for the spar with Tashigi.}  
2. {Take 30 minutes to experiment with your Kiwi Alarm elemental before sleep.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - place a mini kiwi elemental in the drained bathtub, letting any dripping go down the drain. Try to maintain it as I hop into bed, and slowly fall to sleep.

OOC: Extremely low odds of success

**Scene: &quot;The Watcher in the Water&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Hopeful, Experimental, Uncertain**

---

The bath's warmth still clings to your skin, a comfort slowly giving way to exhaustion. Steam trails off the marble walls like the last sighs of the day. Your arms ache in that pleasant, lived-in way-equal parts battle fatigue and recovery. Tomorrow, you spar.

Tonight?

You try something new.

---

You pad barefoot across the tiled floor, and kneel by the **now-drained bathtub**.  
A few **trickles of kiwi juice** still cling to the porcelain from earlier, glinting softly in the candlelight. You touch your palm to the edge, pulse your focus through your fingertips.

**Slow. Gentle. Not an attack. Not a wave.**

Just... a whisper.

A request.

---

&gt; *&quot;Be my eyes while I sleep.&quot;*

---

The juice ripples.  
Quivers.  
Something forms-slowly.  
**A bud. A nub. A tiny shimmer of semi-cohesive form.**

The size of a coconut.

Its body is more **plop** than **soldier**, and you *immediately* know this is nowhere close to Kiwi-Kop. It lacks arms. Legs. Any real shape. It jiggles in place like flan left too long on a warm counter.

But still-  
It wobbles toward the drain, sits directly on top of it, and **doesn't leak.**

You blink.

&gt; *It's plugging the noise.*

Then-

**&quot;Bloop.&quot;**

A soft chirp.  
Barely audible.  
A little hopeful.

---

You stare.

It wobbles.

You nod, slow.

&gt; &quot;...Good enough for a first try.&quot;

---

You leave the bathroom door cracked open, flick off the lanterns, and crawl under the covers.

Your body sinks deep. Your eyelids hang heavy.  
Your senses flicker like the last glow of coals under a kettle.

---

And behind it all...

**A tiny bloop.  
Then silence.**

---

**OOC: Experiment Log - Night One: Subconscious Kiwi Alarm Prototype**  
&gt; **Status:** *Stable. Unintelligent. But real.*  
&gt; **Drain:** Minimal. Estimated functional time: 90 minutes

You sleep.

**End of Day 2**  
**Next: Day 3 - Dawn Sparring with Tashigi**

**Would you like to:**

1. {Begin with the sparring match next scene.}  
2. {Wake up earlier-have breakfast or check for an update from Vivi or the Marines first?}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 2 - Observe the dried patch of juice in the tub. Well, as expected, it didn't last the night.

OOC - On a scale of -100 (pure hatred) to 100 (pure love), describe my character's current relationship levels with relevant characters. -75 would be extreme dislike, 75 would be devoted friend.

---

The sun pierces through the palace curtains like a polite but insistent school bell.

You groan, roll over, and blink blearily into the glow of morning.

Your joints ache. Your mouth is dry. Your dreams were weird. Something about Snack Pack leading a parade.

And the **first thing you do**-because of course you do-is shuffle across the floor, tug open the bathroom door, and peer into the **tub**.

---

There's no golem. No bloop.

Just a faint **stain of dried juice**, clinging to the porcelain like a failed science project and the ghost of a good idea.

You sigh.

&gt; &quot;Well. That tracks.&quot;

You flick the light switch.

&gt; *Flick.* *Flick.*

No movement. No chirp.  
The thing is deader than Crocodile's ego post-defeat.

---

Still.

That was a start.

---

You towel your face, splash on water, and reach for your coat.

There's a duel waiting.  
And breakfast.  
Possibly in that order.

**Relationship Levels (Current Arc Status):**

**Vivi Nefertari** - *Score: 78*  
&gt; She sees you as a protector, a peer, and someone who never demanded the spotlight. Your words and actions remind her of the best parts of her kingdom's ideals. There's warmth in her glances now, comfort in your presence. She may not know what you are to her yet-but she trusts you deeply.

**Tashigi** - *Score: 70*  
&gt; Mutual respect forged through battle and quiet kebab-sharing. She sees you as an ally, an anchor, and-though she'd never admit it-a growing source of calm in her whirlwind life. She's starting to view your presence as... dependable. And maybe more.

**Smoker** - *Score: 45*  
&gt; Professionally skeptical. Personally impressed. He doesn't fully understand you, but he recognizes genuine effort and a willingness to *not be useless*. He'd trust you to guard his flank in a fight... though maybe not to fill out a field report without adding drawings.

**Straw Hat Crew:**
- **Luffy** - *Score: 50*  
  Thinks you're funny, juicy, and fun. Doesn't know if you're a hero or a weird fruit-dad. Trusts you anyway.

  Barely acknowledges you unless you're holding a weapon. Hasn't decided if you're worth remembering.

  They think you're either cool or hilarious. Sanji isn't quite sure what to make of your proximity to Vivi.

  Her status as Miss All Sunday remains a thread dangling in the wind.

**King Cobra** - *Score: 55*  
&gt; Finds you honorable, if extremely bizarre. Deeply respects your promise to &quot;Blue.&quot; Still unsure if the *baton thwack* was bravery, foolishness, or both.

**Rain Dinners Hotel Management** - *Score: -87*  
&gt; You will **not** be receiving a security deposit refund. They *may* have filed a property destruction claim.

**Would you like to:**

1. {Head down for breakfast. You may run into Vivi, Cobra, or Smoker.}  
2. {Stretch and prep for your sparring match. Tashigi's probably already there.}  
3. {Detour to check any mail or messages left for you overnight.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - head to the mail room in the palace. I wonder if they folks back home processed my resignation yet. Or heard the rumors in the tabloids about my alleged heroics (that teacher from our local school did what?!)

---

The palace mail room is surprisingly modest for a royal estate-just a long counter, several cubbies sorted by department and status, and a sleepy postmaster flipping through dispatches while sipping cactus coffee thick enough to coat a spoon in rebellion.

---

You step up, clearing your throat.

The postmaster peers at you over the rim of his mug.

&gt; &quot;You the fruit-slinger from guest room 2B?&quot;

You sigh.

&gt; &quot;That's me.&quot;

He grunts and hands you a surprisingly **thick bundle** of letters and scrolls tied up with twine and juice-proof wax.

---

You step off to the side and start going through them, sorting into two piles: **&quot;Important&quot;** and **&quot;Cringe.&quot;**

---

### LETTER 1: From Your School Administration  
**Red envelope. Official wax seal. Principal Okada's handwriting.**

&gt; &quot;Dear Mr. Cheng,  
&gt; We received your resignation letter. We would like to inform you that:  
&gt; - You are still considered *on extended leave* pending review.  
&gt; - Your absence during school break is not considered misconduct, assuming you're still alive.  
&gt; - Please confirm you are, in fact, still alive.  
&gt; - If you have not been eaten by pirates, please respond with proof of survival and intent.  
&gt; - Your chalk drawer has been repurposed.&quot;  

**PS: &quot;One of the students saw your face in the World Economy News. Please advise if this is a hoax.&quot;**

---

### LETTER 2: From One of Your Students  
**Lined paper. Crayon drawings. Signed &quot;Masato.&quot;**

&gt; &quot;Sensei!! Are you a pirate now??  
&gt; Did you beat up Crocodile?? My big brother said you used fruit to make a dinosaur made of goo!!!  
&gt; Is that true??  
&gt; Also, did you ride a duck?? Can I see a duck??  
&gt; Please write back. School is boring with Mr. Ichikawa. He smells like eggs.  
&gt; - Masato&quot;  

(Drawing included: You holding a sword bigger than Tashigi's, riding a dragon labeled &quot;Snackpak.&quot;)

---

### LETTER 3: From the Tabloid Clipping Service  
**Stamped: âEXPEDITED - HERO RECOGNITION DIVISION'**

An enclosed clipping from the World Economy News:  
&gt; **&quot;Teacher or Terror? The Kiwi Knight of Alabasta!&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Eyewitnesses claim the previously unknown Eatone Cheng-listed as a *part-time bounty hunter* and *full-time substitute teacher*-engaged Warlord Crocodile using mysterious fruit-based summons!&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Government officials have not confirmed whether this man will be recruited by the Marines or charged with the destruction of luxury property across Rainbase.&quot;  

(Two photos: One of you collapsed in Vivi's lap; another, a poorly rendered artist depiction of you riding your own juice elemental like a rodeo champion.)

---

You exhale.

You run your hand through your hair.

You consider going back to bed.

---

But in truth... it's a little heartening.

They haven't forgotten you.  
They're waiting.  
And Masato wants to meet a duck.

---

**OOC: You now have three actionable items:**

1. **Reply to the school.** Confirm your safety and future intentions.  
2. **Write back to your student.** Maybe include a sketch or story.  
3. **Send a rebuttal to the tabloids.** Or lean into it. Maybe start charging autograph fees?

---

Would you like to:

1. {Quickly respond to one or more letters before your sparring match.}  
2. {Tuck them away for later and head toward the training yard.}  
3. {Show the letters to Vivi or Tashigi-maybe the drawing of &quot;Snackpak.&quot;}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 / 3 - 
To the school: Thank you for the extended leave status. I plan to stay in Alubarna to assist with reconstruction in Alabasta. The WEF article is unfortunately, mostly true.
To the student: It wasn't a dinosaur, but it sure looked felt like one. Your teacher fought a big bad pirate to save a princess. I'll come visit sometime with souvenirs. Place a royal palace postcard and local snacks in the envelope.

 Mail off the two letters.

Head to the guard's barracks, where the sparring field, and Tashigi, awaits. I keep the letters that I read tucked under my arm.

---

With your **letters sealed and stamped**, your conscience lighter and your soul slightly stickier from fame, you head down the corridor, passing early morning palace staff and the occasional duck trooper getting lost on the third floor again.

The two letters rest neatly beneath your arm.  
The postcard sticks out with a little cactus stamp and a tiny smiley face you don't remember drawing.

---

As you round the long exterior walkway leading toward the **guard barracks**, the crisp air hits your face-morning sun glinting off the polished clay tiles of the **sparring yard**, where guards train in tight, disciplined formations.

But today?

**A different audience waits.**

---

**Tashigi is already there**, standing beneath the shade of a training arch, **coat draped neatly over a post**, white undershirt tucked into belted trousers, **sword already unsheathed and gleaming**.

She's **stretching. Calm. Focused. Controlled.**

But you know her well enough now to notice the twitch of her jaw as she spots you.

&gt; &quot;Took you long enough.&quot;

---

You lift your hands defensively.

&gt; &quot;Had a post office emergency. Hero stuff. Autographs. International mail.&quot;

You slide the letters into your coat pocket, give your baton a lazy twirl, and take your spot on the sand-dusted sparring circle.

---

Just beyond the edge of the training wall, **a quiet observer peeks through** a lattice screen.

**Blue hair. Curious gaze.**

Vivi doesn't speak, but she watches.

**Quietly rooting.**

---

Tashigi adjusts her grip.

&gt; &quot;No powers,&quot; she says simply. &quot;No summons. Just baton versus blade.&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;But my entire fighting style is based around improvisation, cowardice, and mildly sticky distractions.&quot;

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;That's a no, then?&quot;

---

You grin.  
Extend your baton with a *snap*.

&gt; &quot;Alright, alright. Let's see how much Lady Riko's yellow belt has held up.&quot;

---

**OOC: Sparring Match Initiated!**

This is a friendly match, with minimal risk of injury-but your **dexterity, reaction time**, and **creative use of basic baton skills** will all factor into performance.

No Devil Fruit powers.  
No elementals.  
Just **grit**, **timing**, and possibly **screaming like a gym teacher being chased by geese**.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Go aggressive out the gate. Press her hard, see if you can catch her off guard.}  
2. {Start defensive-observe, adapt, and wait for an opening.}  
3. {Talk during the fight. Distract her. Ask personal questions mid-combat, teacher-style.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - I don't know the full extent of her skills, just that she's good. Maybe not as sharp as the that green haired kid, but she's up there.

**Tone: Focused | Mood: Tactical, Doomed (But With Dignity)**

---

You grip your baton-not extended, not flared, just solid-and keep your stance **light, knees bent**, the way those half-faded library books always said to.

Across from you, **Tashigi's sword dips**, just slightly-**the opening feint of a swordswoman who doesn't need to win, but can't *not* fight seriously.**

---

You take a breath.

&gt; *Observe. Read. Adapt.*

You may be outmatched-but you're a teacher.

You know how to **watch**.

---

**Combat Roll (Defense-Focused)**
- Tashigi: (1d20+8) â **17 + 8 = 25**
- You: (1d20+2) â **4 + 2 = 6**

---

**The first strike is fast.**

**Too fast.**

You *barely* see the blade move-her bokken whips through the air and cracks **clean across your extended baton**, sending a jolt through your arms that rattles your teeth and unbalances your stance.

Your counter comes too slow-she sidesteps, spins, and **taps you once on the shoulder**, then flicks your calf on the follow-through.

---

&gt; &quot;Point,&quot; she says. Crisp. Focused.

You stumble back into your stance, blinking.

&gt; &quot;Okay, okay-didn't think you were gonna go full demo reel from the start.&quot;

---

She exhales slowly.

&gt; &quot;You told me you wanted to learn.&quot;

---

**Second Exchange - You Adjust**

You lower your center of gravity, adjust your grip.

She circles, testing.

You sidestep one lunge, then barely dodge a sweeping horizontal slash-her form textbook, **almost too clean** to counter.

&gt; *She fights like she's always being judged.*

---

**Combat Roll (Adaptation Attempt)**
- Tashigi: (1d20+7) â **14 + 7 = 21**
- You: (1d20+3) â **11 + 3 = 14**

---

You manage to block two strikes-not gracefully, but with **tenacity**. She nods once, approving.

But when you go for a counter, you're just half a beat slow-her sword taps your hand, *pop*, then your knee, *tap*, and with a half-spin she brings the wooden blade up just under your chin.

She doesn't swing.

She just holds it there.

---

&gt; &quot;Point.&quot;

She lowers it gently.

&gt; &quot;And you'd be dead.&quot;

---

You huff.

&gt; &quot;Not if I threw juice in your eyes.&quot;

She smirks. Doesn't disagree.

---

**A few meters away, Vivi winces sympathetically... and then scribbles something down in a notebook.**  
(She might be rating you. She might be doodling Snack Pack again.)

---

You ready yourself.

Tashigi lifts her blade again.

There's no mockery in her expression.  
No ego.

Only respect.

Because even if you're **getting your arse handed to you**, you're **not giving up**.

And that?

Counts for more than points.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Attempt one big surprise maneuver-something creative, chaotic, possibly humiliating.}  
2. {Shift to a purely evasive style-see how long you can survive.}  
3. {Call it here, respectfully. Ask for critique-after all, you're here to learn.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - Maybe I need faster footwork 

OOC: combat rolls remain catastrophically against me, likely for the entirety of the whole spar

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Training Yard - Sparring Match, Round Three]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Art of Not Dying (Immediately)&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Scrappy | Mood: Dogged, Determined, Mostly Dignified**

---

You adjust your stance.

Not lower. Not tighter.  
**Looser. Lighter. Ready to move.**

If you can't win, **maybe you can last.**

&gt; &quot;Alright,&quot; you mutter, adjusting your footing in the sand.  
&gt; &quot;Let's see how long I can run from judgment.&quot;

---

Tashigi narrows her eyes.

&gt; &quot;You're not planning to fight?&quot;

You grin.

&gt; &quot;I'm planning to survive. Different martial art.&quot;

---

She exhales. And lunges.

---

**Combat Roll - Evasion Mode Activated**  
- Tashigi: (1d20+8) â **19 + 8 = 27**  
- You: (1d20+4) â **7 + 4 = 11**

---

**First pass:**

You dodge left.  
She's already there.

Her bokken taps your side *twice*, then your shoulder as you pivot away.

You roll, and sand fills your collar.  
A move so ungraceful it loops back into respectable.

---

&gt; &quot;Point,&quot; she says.

You grunt.

&gt; &quot;Warmup round.&quot;

---

**Second pass:**

You sprint.

Not toward her-*around* her.  
Wide circles. Kicking up sand.

She watches, amused.

Then?

She darts in like a hawk.

---

**Combat Roll - Endurance Attempt**
- Tashigi: (1d20+6) â **13 + 6 = 19**
- You: (1d20+4) â **13 + 4 = 17**

---

This time, you *barely* escape the first two strikes.  
You duck one.  
Trip over your own coat.

*BUT YOU RECOVER.*

Your baton swipes wildly-accidentally deflecting her blade with a **loud CLACK**, purely from falling sideways.

---

Tashigi halts, blinking.  
Not hurt. Just stunned.

&gt; &quot;...Did you just parry by collapsing?&quot;

You pant.

&gt; &quot;Advanced technique. Taught to me by Lady Riko-sensei in the âAvoid the Hip Fracture' kata.&quot;

---

A laugh.  
Short. Sharp.  
But real.

Tashigi steps back, sword down.

&gt; &quot;You're a disaster.&quot;

You lean on your baton.

&gt; &quot;I am a **resilient** disaster.&quot;

---

**Off to the side, Vivi applauds softly.**  
Like a parent watching a kindergartener dodge their first punch.

You give a little bow.  
Fall over slightly mid-bow.

Recover. Dignity intact (mostly).

---

**OOC: You did not win. Not even close.  
But you earned her respect. And the audience's.**

Sometimes surviving long enough to get hit *less* is still a win.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Call it here and ask for pointers. A real student moment.}  
2. {Suggest another round-with some very minor fruit assistance, maybe?}  
3. {Collapse dramatically and ask for water and possibly a medal.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Genuinely compliment Tashigi's skills 
I look over at the wall at Vivi. You enjoy watching Marine brutality, blue?

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Training Yard - Post-Sparring Cooldown]**  
**Scene: &quot;Sword, Sweat, and Sincere Words&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Respectful | Mood: Mutual Admiration, Playful Recovery**

---

You drop to one knee-half to catch your breath, half because the last spin move you attempted pulled a muscle that hasn't been named in medical literature yet.

You look up at Tashigi, still holding her practice blade in a loose grip, posture clean, hair only *slightly* mussed.

&gt; &quot;You're good.&quot;

You mean it. There's no cheek, no sarcasm.  
Just quiet honesty, with a wheeze of effort.

&gt; &quot;Like, *really* good. The kind of good that makes me glad we're on the same side of the warlord-chopping equation.&quot;

---

Tashigi's brow lifts slightly.

&gt; &quot;You're not so bad yourself,&quot; she replies.

Then smirks.

&gt; &quot;I've never seen someone dodge with such... commitment to panic.&quot;

You grin, shaking out your wrist.

&gt; &quot;Panic is a valid martial art.&quot;

---

You tilt your head toward the wall where **Vivi's blue hair peeks out like a spy in training**, her notebook now closed, her expression unreadable-but her amusement **palpable**.

You raise your voice just enough to carry.

&gt; &quot;You enjoy watching Marine brutality, Blue?&quot;

Her head pokes out further.  
She does not look even remotely sorry.

&gt; &quot;Only when it's well-earned,&quot; she says with a laugh.  
&gt; &quot;Besides-watching you get *absolutely demolished* was oddly therapeutic.&quot;

---

You fake a wounded gasp.

&gt; &quot;You hear that, Tashigi-chan? No appreciation for finesse. Not even for my advanced defensive rolling technique.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I call it the Juicy Evasion Spiral.&quot;

---

Tashigi walks over, offers you a hand.

You take it-only a little sore-and she hauls you to your feet.

&gt; &quot;Same time next week?&quot; she asks.

You dust yourself off.

&gt; &quot;Sure. And maybe next time, I'll last more than... what was that, five minutes?&quot;

She considers.

&gt; &quot;Six. If we count the collapse.&quot;

You sigh.

&gt; &quot;I'll take it.&quot;

---

**OOC:**

- Tashigi's respect for you has **ticked up** slightly. Not because you fought well-but because you *wanted to learn*.  
- Vivi has now seen you get beaten into the sand and still crack jokes. That matters to her more than heroics ever did.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Walk with Tashigi to breakfast-perhaps Vivi joins.}  
2. {Check in with Smoker. He may have an errand or update for you.}  
3. {Head to the gardens for a breath of quiet, after all that rolling.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - show them the letters. From school, students, and tabloids.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Corridor to the Breakfast Hall]**  
**Scene: &quot;Letters, Laughter, and a Lap of Fame&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Wholesome | Mood: Light, Heartfelt, Connected**

---

Your legs are still twitching with phantom pain from the Tashigi Special (â¢), but at least you're upright and on your way to breakfast-with two of the strongest-willed women you've ever met flanking you like bodyguards who just so happen to also sass you into humility.

You rummage through your coat and pull out the **letters**, thumbing the edges thoughtfully.

&gt; &quot;Hey,&quot; you say, holding them up. &quot;Wanna see something funny?&quot;

Tashigi looks over, mildly suspicious.

Vivi glances back with curiosity already blooming in her expression.

---

You hold up the first-**Principal Okada's Letter**.

&gt; &quot;This one's from my school. They think I'm on... *extended leave.*&quot;

You clear your throat.

&gt; &quot;Quote: âPlease confirm you are, in fact, still alive.'&quot;

Tashigi nearly snorts her tea. Vivi chokes down a laugh behind a hand.

---

You tap the second letter, then hand it over to Vivi with exaggerated care.

&gt; &quot;This one's from a student. Kid named Masato. Very serious. Very academic.&quot;

They both lean in, reading the crayon-scrawled message:

&gt; _&quot;Sensei! Are you a pirate now?? Did you beat up Crocodile??&quot;_

And then the drawing.  
Of you.  
Holding a sword the size of the palace tower.  
Riding a poorly drawn gator with a mustache and labeled &quot;Snackpak.&quot;

---

Vivi bursts into laughter, clutching the drawing.

&gt; &quot;You *have* to frame this!&quot;

Tashigi leans over her shoulder.

&gt; &quot;It's disturbingly accurate.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I never wore that many belts,&quot; you mutter.

---

And finally-the **tabloid clipping**.

You flash it with mock pride:

&gt; **&quot;The Kiwi Knight of Alabasta!&quot;**  
&gt; &quot;Hero of the People or Just Mildly Sticky Menace?&quot;

Vivi covers her mouth, shoulders shaking.  
Tashigi flat-out laughs, her usually reserved demeanor cracking like a dropped teacup.

---

&gt; &quot;Mildly sticky menace,&quot; she repeats under her breath.

&gt; &quot;That's going on your gravestone,&quot; Vivi adds.

---

You grin as you tuck the letters back into your coat.

&gt; &quot;Y'know... I was worried they'd just move on without me. But it's kind of nice, knowing someone out there's still paying attention. Even if it's just a student with wild artistic delusions.&quot;

---

Tashigi's smile softens.

&gt; &quot;They're proud. That much is clear.&quot;

Vivi nods, eyes thoughtful.

&gt; &quot;It means they still see the teacher. Even after everything.&quot;

---

You pause, that weight settling in your chest again.  
Not heavy. Just... **real**.

---

You walk on together, laughter lingering like perfume in the corridor.  
And for the first time in a while, the path ahead feels a little less uncertain.

---

**OOC: Your bond with both Vivi and Tashigi has deepened through shared vulnerability and laughter.**  
**They see not just the man who stood beside them-but the one who still belongs to the world beyond war.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Join them for breakfast. See if Cobra or Smoker drops in.}  
2. {Sit with Vivi privately, maybe share more from your life.}  
3. {Offer to train a new palace guard recruit team with Tashigi today.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Head to the dining hall. I'll drop my response letters at the post office later

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Royal Dining Hall, Morning of Day 3]**  
**Scene: &quot;Breakfast of Survivors&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Comforting | Mood: Familiar, Light-Bonded Banter**

---

The palace doors part as the three of you enter together, and you're hit with the warm aroma of **spiced eggs, grilled cactus blossoms, and fresh flatbreads** stacked high beside bowls of minty yogurt and sweet melon slices.

You half expect trumpets and a scroll announcing *&quot;Now Entering: The Sticky Defender of the People&quot;*-but thankfully, **no fanfare.** Just the **clink of cutlery**, the **low murmur of guards and aides**, and the gentle hum of **a kingdom trying to return to normal**.

---

**King Cobra** is already seated, robe loosely tied, sipping something thick and caffeinated.  
He raises an eyebrow as your trio enters.

&gt; &quot;Good morning,&quot; he rumbles. &quot;I see the morning spar didn't kill you.&quot;

You salute lazily.

&gt; &quot;The secret is to collapse early and often. Builds morale.&quot;

---

Tashigi smirks. Vivi rolls her eyes, already moving to take her usual spot at her father's right.

You... awkwardly hover.

Until Cobra gestures to the seat across from him.

&gt; &quot;Sit. Before I assign you as the royal mop again.&quot;

---

You oblige.

---

**Moments later, Smoker arrives**, trailing a mild cloud of steam behind him, a large scar freshly bandaged near his left temple. He gives you a long, flat look.

&gt; &quot;Still alive, huh?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Define âalive,'&quot; you reply, through a mouthful of grilled onion.

He grunts. Takes the seat next to Tashigi.

---

For a while, **breakfast proceeds like a quiet little miracle**:

- **Smoker and Cobra** discuss **marine coordination and civil rebuilds**, though Smoker continues trying to correct the tabloids about his &quot;solo heroism.&quot;
- **Tashigi keeps glancing at you** like she might ask for a rematch at any moment.
- **Vivi passes you a bowl of fruit**, pointedly sliding the kiwi slices to your side.
- You share a few more **letters** for their amusement, including one from the school cafeteria lady who threatens to pickle your kneecaps if you don't return her missing ladle.

---

And somewhere in between mouthfuls and mirth-

You feel it.

That **thread of belonging**.  
A subtle, warm undercurrent.

You're not just a tourist anymore.  
Not just a &quot;sticky menace.&quot;  
You're **a thread in the tapestry** now.

---

**OOC: Scene Concludes**  
You've gained:

- **+5 Relationship (All):** Shared meal, comfort, humor.  
- **+1 Reputation (Palace Staff):** Known as &quot;That Guy Who Fought a Warlord and Eats a Lot of Melon.&quot;  
- **Inventory Note:** You still have your response letters, tucked in coat. Ready to mail post-breakfast.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Speak privately with Cobra after breakfast about more permanent residency.}  
2. {Return to town with Tashigi to continue patrols.}  
3. {Spend some of the morning with Vivi before the next wave of royal duties takes her.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - I really want to confirm my residency status, and make sure I'm registered in the tax system. Also that if I have an official job title or a salary (to pay taxes on). I don't want to be a mooch forever, after all.

---

Breakfast ends on a warm note-plates cleared, laughter shared, guards trying not to openly giggle at Vivi's dramatic reading of your school cafeteria lady's ladle ultimatum.

But you've got things to handle.

**Grown-up things.**

---

You quietly pull **King Cobra** aside just as he's rising from his chair, still loosening the belt of his robe like a man who longs for the sweet embrace of a post-breakfast nap.

&gt; &quot;Your Majesty, I was hoping we could... talk briefly? Something I've been meaning to get squared away.&quot;

---

He gives you a long, side-eyed glance.

&gt; &quot;Is this about the baton thing again?&quot;

&gt; &quot;No, no, we're good on the kneecap front.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Good,&quot; he says dryly. &quot;They still ache.&quot;

---

**Moments later-**  
You're in **Cobra's study**, a comfortably dusty room of dark wood and old tomes, the **air perfumed with ink, desert parchment, and sun-baked nostalgia.**

He gestures toward a long desk with various forms already laid out-he may be a king, but he clearly also doubles as the Kingdom's HR department when necessary.

You awkwardly clear your throat.

---

&gt; &quot;So... I'm staying. At least for a while. Maybe longer.&quot;

Cobra leans on the desk, lacing his fingers.

&gt; &quot;Good.&quot;

You blink.

&gt; &quot;Wait, that's it?&quot;

&gt; &quot;You saved my daughter's life, my country's capital, and quite possibly a few future monarchs that haven't even been born yet. If you want to settle here, *you* tell *me* what you need.&quot;

---

You fumble for your notes.

&gt; &quot;Right-well, for starters: I'd like to register for **permanent residency**. I'd also like to be listed in the **tax system**-wouldn't want to be labeled a mooch.&quot;

Cobra raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;You... *want* to pay taxes?&quot;

You nod solemnly.

&gt; &quot;With great civic benefit comes great fiscal responsibility.&quot;

---

He stares at you for a beat too long.

Then slowly pulls a form from a drawer.

&gt; &quot;This one's for **residency status**. Includes optional medical coverage, palace contractor benefits, and local access to kebab subsidies.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Oh, and this one's the **employment affidavit**. We don't exactly have a checkbox for âfruit-based freelance hero'-but I can write in something like *âRoyal Reconstruction Consultant.'*&quot;

You blink again.

&gt; &quot;That's... an actual job title?&quot;

&gt; &quot;With salary,&quot; Cobra nods. &quot;Standard for civic advisors and post-crisis morale liaisons.&quot;

&gt; &quot;With taxes,&quot; he adds, amused.

---

You take the pen with reverence.

&gt; &quot;I never thought signing a W-2 could feel so victorious.&quot;

---

**OOC: Administrative Victory Achieved!**  
You are now officially a **resident of Alubarna**, listed in the **Royal Tax &amp; Census Registry** as a:

&gt; **Royal Reconstruction Consultant (Provisional)**  
&gt; Status: Civic Morale Liaison / Bounty Risk Triage Specialist  
&gt; Compensation: Modest salary, subsidized housing (if needed), free kebab stand access on weekends.  

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Visit the palace clerk to submit the forms, then return to Tashigi.}  
2. {Swing by Vivi's office with your new official ID-perhaps show off a little.}  
3. {Take a stroll through the capital to let it all sink in.}

**Scene: &quot;Paperwork and Promotion Bragging Rights&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Playful | Mood: Earnest, Lighthearted Pride**

---

The **ministerial wing** of the palace is a very different flavor of regal-quieter, all **hushed sandal steps on polished stone**, interrupted only by the shuffling of papers, the scratching of pens, and the occasional nervous squeak of a junior scribe trying not to spill tea on century-old maps.

---

You wind through the corridors, forms neatly tucked under one arm and your new **Royal Reconstruction Consultant badge** glinting faintly on your chest-**laminated**, **official**, and **probably sticky-proof.**

You pass a guard who gives you a curious once-over.

You give him the slow nod of a man with taxpayer status and kebab rights.

---

**Vivi's door is open.**  
She's seated at a wide desk piled with more documents than one human should be expected to process in a lifetime.  
Her pen's in motion. Her brow's furrowed.

And when she hears your knock, she looks up with a tired smile.

&gt; &quot;Hey. What's up?&quot;

You strike a pose.

Hands on hips. Badge prominently displayed.

&gt; &quot;Guess who just got promoted from royal bum to official palace staff.&quot;

---

She tilts her head.

Eyes dart to your badge.

Then back to you.

&gt; &quot;...Royal Reconstruction Consultant?&quot;

You grin.

&gt; &quot;With kebab access. On weekends.&quot;

---

She laughs. It's short, but genuine.

Then rises, walks over, and gives your badge a little tap.

&gt; &quot;So you're official now, huh?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Fully certified. Might even pay taxes someday.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Now you're just showing off.&quot;

You shrug.

&gt; &quot;Civic pride.&quot;

---

She pauses, expression softening.

&gt; &quot;I'm glad you're staying.&quot;

There's no teasing in her tone now. Just truth.

&gt; &quot;We need people like you.&quot;

---

You blink, a bit caught off guard.

&gt; &quot;You mean mildly injured, legally employed part-time fruit guys?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Exactly those.&quot;

---

She returns to her desk, pulling out a small, slim folder from a drawer.  
The royal seal on the front is newer-drafted within the last day or two.

&gt; &quot;Since you're official now...&quot; she says, placing it in your hands,  
&gt; &quot;I had this drawn up.&quot;

Inside is a **welcome packet**.  
Complete with:

- Your **official citizen code**  
- A map of **preferred vendor kebab stalls**  
- And-adorably-a **handwritten note** at the bottom:

&gt; &quot;Your school's lucky to have had you.  
&gt; Alubarna is luckier now.&quot;

---

You stand there a moment too long.

Trying to figure out where to file that feeling in your heart.

Eventually you just nod, tuck the folder into your coat, and grin like a student who just passed a pop quiz without studying.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Invite Vivi for a walk through the market-you're technically on duty now.}  
2. {Return to Tashigi and Smoker to report your change in status.}  
3. {Take the rest of the day slow. Find a rooftop. Watch the city.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - Good luck with the paperwork, blue. Let me know if you need any pointers, I'm an expert at it.

---

&gt; &quot;Good luck with the paperwork, Blue,&quot; you say, slipping the folder into your coat and tossing her a little salute.  
&gt; &quot;Let me know if you need any pointers-after today, I'm basically an expert.&quot;

---

Vivi snorts softly behind you as you turn and head for the courtyard, her voice following like the dry wind of the desert:

&gt; &quot;Only if I want it covered in juice and filed under âimprovised weaponry.'&quot;

---

You grin to yourself the whole walk down the corridor.

---

A few turns later, you find yourself near the **Marine coordination center**, a converted wing of the palace where Smoker and Tashigi have set up temporary operations. Civil engineers and uniformed officers shuffle maps, clipboards, and casualty reports like chess pieces across the desert's aftershocks.

You spot **Tashigi**, already suited back up in her standard uniform, hair pinned tighter than usual. She looks up the moment you approach-eyes squinting.

&gt; &quot;You look smug.&quot;

You flash your new ID badge like a kid showing off a perfect test score.

&gt; &quot;I'm legitimate now. Fully-licensed. Kebab-access-verified.&quot;

She raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;Congratulations. That means you're finally taxable.&quot;

&gt; &quot;My proudest moment.&quot;

---

Just then, **Smoker** steps out from one of the interior briefing rooms, lighting both cigars at once like a man actively trying to shorten his paperwork lifespan.

His eyes flick to you.

&gt; &quot;You file in with the civil side?&quot;

You nod.

&gt; &quot;Royal Reconstruction Consultant.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Catchy,&quot; he mutters. &quot;What, are you doing foundation checks with your juice powers?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Only the *most foundational of responsibilities*, sir.&quot;

---

Smoker exhales twin streams of smoke and grumbles something about &quot;damn freelancers infiltrating the chain of command.&quot;

He gestures toward the main desk, where a sealed envelope sits. It's heavy. Official.

&gt; &quot;Paperwork came in from Marine HQ,&quot; he says. &quot;I was gonna tell her later-figured she was too busy clobbering civilians with wooden swords.&quot;

Tashigi's eyes narrow.

&gt; &quot;...Captain?&quot;

Smoker offers the envelope with all the grace of a man offering someone a particularly stressful birthday gift.

&gt; &quot;**Congratulations, Ensign.** Effective immediately.&quot;

---

Tashigi blinks.

Then looks down at the envelope in her hand like it's warm to the touch.

&gt; &quot;You pulled rank with HQ?&quot; she asks, voice low, almost disbelieving.

&gt; &quot;I put in a recommendation.&quot; He shrugs. &quot;HQ agreed. You earned it. That's the job.&quot;

She looks a little stunned.

Just for a second.

Then glances your way-like she might want to pretend it's just a morning like any other.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Congratulate her respectfully-with some light teasing.}  
2. {Salute, dramatically. Maybe even bow. She deserves the moment.}  
3. {Play it cool, offer to buy her a kebab to celebrate. You *do* have official kebab privileges now.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - well, we knew it was coming. Enjoy the moment regardless

**Scene: &quot;Salutes and Small Victories&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Heartfelt | Mood: Warm, Earned Recognition**

---

Tashigi stares at the promotion letter in her hand like it's heavier than it should be. The weight of expectation, of proving herself, of always trying to catch up to ghosts with swords in their hands-**you see it all in her eyes.**

You knew this was coming.

But it still hits different when it's *here.*

---

So you do what's right.

You straighten up.

Stand a little taller.

And then-with all the ceremony of a soldier, and none of the sarcasm of the teacher who once greased himself through an entire warzone-you give her a proper, sharp **salute.**

&gt; &quot;Congratulations, Ensign Tashigi.&quot;

Your voice is steady.

Sincere.

---

She looks up, caught off guard.

&gt; &quot;You're serious?&quot; she mutters, almost defensively-like she expected a quip about paper-pushing or your baton finally having to answer to a superior.

You don't budge.

&gt; &quot;Dead serious. You earned that title. Fully. I saw it happen.&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;Multiple times. Usually while I was bleeding behind you.&quot;

---

Tashigi's cheeks tint slightly. Not with embarrassment. With that rare, subtle kind of pride that only ever comes after being seen clearly and recognized for who you are.

She salutes back-clean, sharp.

Then lowers her hand and rolls her eyes-just a little.

&gt; &quot;Alright, alright. You're going to make Vivi think you're getting *responsible* or something.&quot;

---

Smoker grunts behind you both, clearly satisfied with the awkward emotional tension and immediately reaching for his report stack like he didn't just help alter someone's future.

&gt; &quot;If you're done saluting each other like rookies at a boot camp parade,&quot; he mutters, &quot;we've got two more rebel groups to debrief, and some fresh intel about Baroque Works remnants in the southern basin.&quot;

---

You glance at Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;Duty calls, Ensign.&quot;

She snorts. Quiet. Soft.

&gt; &quot;Still sounds weird.&quot;

You grin.

&gt; &quot;Sounds earned.&quot;

---

**OOC: Tashigi's bond with you deepens.**  
Not romantic-not yet. But something steady. Something built.

**Mutual respect. Quiet faith.**

And the beginning of a partnership worth defending.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Accompany Tashigi on her next patrol-maybe investigate the southern basin leads.}  
2. {Swing by Vivi's office to relay the good news. She'll want to celebrate it.}  
3. {Sneak off to try one of those kebab stalls with your hard-won food privileges. Possibly bring one back as a trophy.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Not many people dare face a logia warlord with nothing but a sword. You deserve that more than anyone else.

my ears perk up at the mention of Baroque works.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna - South Gate Barracks, Late Morning]**  
**Scene: &quot;Remnants in the Sand&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Investigative | Mood: Tension-Building, Quiet Determination**

---

You and Tashigi are already halfway down the marble stairwell before Smoker even finishes the word &quot;southern.&quot;  
She doesn't say anything, but you can see the shift in her step-the controlled urgency, the Marine sense honed by battle and guilt and **unfinished business.**

---

You match her pace.

&gt; &quot;Not many people dare to face a Logia warlord with nothing but a sword,&quot; you say, your voice steady despite the bounce of descending steps.  
&gt; &quot;You deserve that rank more than anyone else I've seen wear a uniform.&quot;

She doesn't respond immediately. Just lets her hair blow back in the dry courtyard breeze as you both cross the sandstone plaza toward the **South Gate Barracks**.

Then, finally, her voice-low:

&gt; &quot;I still lost.&quot;

You nudge her arm lightly with your elbow.

&gt; &quot;And I still saw you *try.* With everything. That's not losing, Tashigi-chan. That's leading.&quot;

---

**Your words hang between you**, not as flattery, but as shared memory.

The kind that binds people.

The kind forged in chaos, sealed in silence, and remembered in the way a companion walks beside you, not behind.

---

You arrive at the **southern watch post**, where two Royal Guards flank a **tightly folded map on a makeshift table**, along with **an open crate of confiscated weapons**-rusty, mismatched, but far too organized for a few desert looters.

One of the officers salutes as you approach.

&gt; &quot;Ma'am. Civilian Advisor.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Royal Reconstruction Consultant,&quot; you correct automatically.

Tashigi smirks faintly.

&gt; &quot;Report.&quot;

The guard nods.

&gt; &quot;Two patrols found signs of movement around an abandoned waystation near the southern basin line. Footprints circling what used to be a Baroque Works supply cache. Light, fast, organized. No rebel colors. No royal banners. We think... it might be **remnant agents.**&quot;

---

You squint at the map.

Your ears, already perked at the name &quot;Baroque Works,&quot; twitch further.

&gt; &quot;That cache was near the old sandstone quarry, right?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Perfect place for an ambush, if they're staging something.&quot;

Tashigi folds her arms.

&gt; &quot;They could be trying to recover something Crocodile left behind.&quot;

You glance at her.

&gt; &quot;Or tie up loose ends.&quot;

---

She nods once.

&gt; &quot;We leave in ten. Two guards, us, light gear.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Want me to bring Kiwi Kop?&quot; you ask, only half-joking.

&gt; &quot;Only if it doesn't flood the whole basin.&quot;

&gt; &quot;No promises.&quot;

---

**OOC: A patrol mission is forming-more than a routine walk, less than a full siege. Think: Recon &amp; Response.**

Objectives may include:

- Identifying remnant agents  
- Preventing recovery of Baroque Works materials  
- Capturing any surviving leadership figures (ex. Mr. 7, Mr. 11, etc.)  
- Avoiding further civilian conflict

---

Would you like to:

1. {Prep with palace gear-light armor, travel cloak, maybe a few potions/snacks.}  
2. {Head out immediately with minimal equipment, catch them before they scatter.}  
3. {Split roles-Tashigi leads front, you flank solo with a mini Kiwi scout active. Risky but stealthier.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - I left my old bounty hunter's gear at home. Guess I'll use their kit. It doesn't fit perfectly, but it sure looks fancier.

To Tashigi's comment about losing - Rank doesn't always mean winning. I heard a rumor of a Commodore in the East Blue that got annihilated by some pirate group in the Conomi islands. 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Alubarna Palace - Outfitting Room, Before Departure]**  
**Scene: &quot;Reconstruction Consultant, Reporting for Field Duty&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Grounded | Mood: Honest, Battle-Ready, Quiet Camaraderie**

---

You adjust the straps on your borrowed **field vest**, cinching the slightly too-wide chest plate with a grunt as the palace quartermaster checks for loose stitching. The gear's clearly made for a **stockier frame**, but you make it work-nothing a little belt-tightening and strategic Kiwi slick couldn't fix in a pinch.

It's simple gear:  
**Sturdy boots**, **weather-treated shoulder pads**, **a desert cloak**, and a **palace-marked sash** with your official insignia stitched into the hem.

&gt; &quot;Looks good on you,&quot; one of the young guards mutters as he hands you a travel flask.  
&gt; &quot;If you stand in the right lighting, you almost look like someone who wins fights.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Hey, I *survive* them,&quot; you counter.  
&gt; &quot;That's a form of winning.&quot;

---

As you step out into the main yard where **Tashigi's already waiting**, boots planted, arms crossed, sword freshly cleaned, she glances over her shoulder at you.

Eyes flicking over the gear.

&gt; &quot;You clean up alright.&quot;

You smirk.

&gt; &quot;And you still look like you could parry a thunderstorm.&quot;

---

She starts walking, and you fall in beside her. Two guards follow, light crossbows on their backs.

As the **southern wind picks up**, you pull your hood up loosely, ready for the grit and sun. Your baton's strapped across your back-Sea-Prism tip polished, handle scuffed from too many recent nightmares made real.

---

Then-quietly, as the gate starts to lower-you speak again.

&gt; &quot;About what you said earlier. That you lost.&quot;

She doesn't answer immediately.

&gt; &quot;Rank doesn't always mean winning, you know. I once heard about a **Commodore in the East Blue** who got annihilated by some pirates at the **Conomi Islands**.&quot;

Tashigi glances at you.

&gt; &quot;Arlong.&quot;

You nod.

&gt; &quot;That's the one. Guy got chewed up by a shark-man and his goons. Rank meant nothing when the fight came.&quot;

You give her a sidelong glance.

&gt; &quot;But you? You *stood* against a Warlord with a sword and your spine. That's more than a title. That's character.&quot;

---

Tashigi doesn't respond for a long moment.

Then-quietly:

&gt; &quot;I'm starting to understand that.&quot;

And she means it.

---

**[Mission Start: Desert Remnant Sweep]**  
**Location: Sandstone Quarry, Southern Basin**  
**Team: You, Tashigi, 2 Royal Guards**  
**Objective: Investigate movement at former Baroque supply cache. Engage only if necessary.**

**Gear Acquired:**
- Desert Cloak (+ minor sun resistance)  
- Reinforced travel vest (+1 to minor wound threshold)  
- Satchel with: 1 health poultice, 1 desert ration, 1 juice stabilizing canteen  
- Loaned palace comm shell (short-range Den Den Mushi, 2 km effective)

---

As the gates open, and you begin your ride across the southern trail, dust trailing behind your boots like ghostly echoes of a war barely ended-

You realize something.

You're not chasing peace anymore.

You're helping build it.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Talk with the guards en route-learn more about recent sightings.}  
2. {Walk in silence. Focus. Feel the land. Let the tension build naturally.}  
3. {Deploy a mini Kiwi scout down the ridge when the quarry nears. Risk early detection.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Shoot the shit with the guards. Talking about worming my way through alleys during the final battle.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[South Alubarna Trail - En Route to Quarry]**  
**Scene: &quot;Desert Chatter &amp; Gooey Glory&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Light | Mood: Bonding, Morale Boost**

---

The four of you march in a loose column, the **sun flaring off the dunes** like a furnace full of mirages. Your cloak flaps lightly in the breeze, your boots crunch grit beneath. Tashigi walks ahead with the calm, unreadable face of someone who's keeping her mind sharp-blade ready to draw at a moment's notice.

But the **two guards**, a pair of young royal infantrymen named **Jalim and Mikk**, trail just a few paces back.

They whisper for a while.

Until one finally blurts:

&gt; &quot;Hey, sir-*Consultant*, I mean-are the rumors true?&quot;

You turn, raising an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;Which rumors?&quot;

Jalim leans forward with wide eyes.

&gt; &quot;The ones where you turned into a giant... *juice dragon* during the final battle! They said you swam through a puddle like a fish and exploded out of a vent!&quot;

Mikk elbows him.

&gt; &quot;No, idiot, that was Snack Pack-the Bananagator he *tamed*. Get it right.&quot;

---

You give a long sigh. And then start **grinning**.

&gt; &quot;Alright, alright, settle down. I'll tell you how it happened.&quot;

---

As the sun climbs and the trail winds toward the first crumbling ridge of the **old sandstone basin**, you regale the guards with your gloriously exaggerated tale:

- **You**, crawling through alleys like a **greased-up predator**, leaving trails of *citrus doom* behind you.
- The **concussive headbutt** into a Baroque agent's plated chest, which you dramatically refer to as *&quot;Kiwi Blitzkrieg.&quot;*
- The **Emerald Titan** erupting from a pool of fruit and desperation at the 5-minute mark-*&quot;an elemental of tropical vengeance,&quot;* you explain, hands waving for dramatic effect.
- And your *strategic* napping that &quot;lured Crocodile into a false sense of victory.&quot;

---

By the end, both guards are *howling*, Mikk trying not to trip over his own feet.

Tashigi, from the front, calls back without turning:

&gt; &quot;You forgot the part where you flopped over Vivi's lap and muttered about Snack Pack in your sleep.&quot;

You pause.

&gt; &quot;That was a *tactical morale reset.*&quot;

---

Jalim pipes up.

&gt; &quot;Sir, if I die today, I just want to say I'm glad I got to patrol with the Sticky Knight of Alubarna.&quot;

You hold up a hand.

&gt; &quot;Sticky *Consultant*, thank you.&quot;

---

The tone shifts as you reach the **crest of the ridge**, and the **quarry stretches below you**: stone ruins, a cracked supply depot, faded Baroque markings barely visible on the sandstone.

Everything's quiet. Too quiet.

---

**OOC: Morale boost achieved. Guards are loyal, in good spirits.**  
You may gain a small bonus to rolls involving teamwork or protection of the guards.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Deploy Kiwi Scout for a look inside the depot before descending.}  
2. {Send one guard around the flank while you descend with the rest.}  
3. {Enter quietly as a group-slow, deliberate, minimize noise.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - hold on Tashigi-chan. Check this out.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Southern Sandstone Quarry - Overlook Ridge]**  
**Scene: &quot;Fruit Reconnaissance&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical | Mood: Lightly Dramatic, Focused**

---

You hold up a hand as the wind tugs at your cloak.

&gt; &quot;Hold up, Tashigi-chan. You're about to witness some *real* tactical innovation.&quot;

She pauses mid-step, turning with a single arched eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;If this ends with you falling down the hill again, I'm drawing my sword.&quot;

You grin and step toward the edge of the ridge, crouching down as you draw moisture from your palm. The air hisses slightly as **a translucent puddle of green-yellow kiwi juice** spreads across the dusty stone beneath you.

You narrow your eyes.

Focus.

---

&gt; &quot;Operation: Kiwi Recon engaged.&quot;

---

**The puddle ripples-then coils upward into a tiny, gelatinous figure.**  
Two arms. A bulbous upper body. No legs, but a trail like a snail behind it.  
Eyes? Technically, no. But you **will** it to know where to go.

It gives you a little *splurt*.

&gt; &quot;That's Kiwi Scout 1,&quot; you say to the others, wiping your hands.  
&gt; &quot;He's a reconnaissance specialist. Probably unionized.&quot;

Jalim and Mikk exchange stunned glances. One whispers, &quot;...he's *so* small.&quot;

&gt; &quot;He's proud,&quot; you reply.

---

You gently place him at the edge of a broken slope leading into the depot's ruins.

He oozes down, silently, his **slick trail of juice hidden in the color of the sand.**

---

**OOC: SCOUT DEPLOYED.**

**Recon Roll (Kiwi Scout Stealth &amp; Sensory Relay)**  
- Kiwi Scout Stealth: (1d20+2) â **17 + 2 = 19**  
- Enemy Perception: (1d20+1) â **4 + 1 = 5**

---

**SUCCESS.**

---

You close your eyes as the **sensation of the scout's movement pulses through your palm**-soft vibrations, like gentle footfalls echoed through syrup.

Inside the depot... it's **quiet. But not empty.**

You feel:

- Two heat signatures-human. One moving. One seated.  
- Scattered crates, likely opened recently.  
- A faint, sharp smell-like **oiled steel and smoked parchment. Gunpowder? Traps?**  
- The **distinct rumble of a Den Den Mushi**, either active or recently used.

---

&gt; &quot;There are at least two people in there,&quot; you mutter.  
&gt; &quot;One pacing. One sitting, probably watching. Doesn't feel like they're panicking.&quot;

Tashigi kneels beside you, listening closely.

&gt; &quot;Could be leadership. Or a holdout cell.&quot;

&gt; &quot;They cracked some of the old supply crates. There's... weapon scent. Could be prepping something nasty.&quot;

---

You look up at the rest of the team.

&gt; &quot;They haven't noticed us yet. If we want to move, we move smart.&quot;

---

**OOC: Excellent scout read. Surprise round available if you choose to engage.**

Would you like to:

1. {Send Tashigi and a guard to circle around while you and the second guard breach from above.}  
2. {Attempt to intercept the Den Den Mushi-find out who they were talking to before they finish.}  
3. {Engage all together-fast and overwhelming, try to subdue before they react.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 3 - you think we should call for backup? I recall the kiwi scout, and grow it near human size

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Southern Sandstone Quarry - Pre-Assault Position]**  
**Scene: &quot;Kiwi Titan: Recon Edition&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Strategic | Mood: Rising Tension, Controlled Chaos**

---

You rise from your crouch and glance toward Tashigi, still kneeling, her sword unsheathed just slightly-just enough for you to catch a **glimmer of readiness** in her eyes.

&gt; &quot;Think we should call for backup?&quot; you ask in a low murmur.  
&gt; &quot;This could be nothing. Or it could be another chapter of Crocodile's memoirs.&quot;

Tashigi doesn't immediately answer.

She peers toward the depot's battered rooftop, eyes narrowing, calculating wind, distance, elevation, sightlines.

&gt; &quot;No. If we move now, we have surprise. If we wait, they vanish. Or worse-finish whatever they're trying to pull together.&quot;

She turns to you.

&gt; &quot;We take them.&quot;

You nod. The decision made.

---

You raise your hand and **call back Kiwi Scout**-the trail of glistening juice suddenly doubling back like a reverse drip, coiling into your palm with a faint squelch and shimmer of light.

Tashigi flinches slightly.

Jalim stares in awe.

Mikk: &quot;What the hell-&quot;

---

You concentrate, pulling deeper on your fruit's **viscous reserve**. The juice gathers in thick coils, and you slam your hand into the dirt as it *erupts upward* in a wet roar.

**Kiwi Kop emerges.**

No legs. Just mass-**four feet high**, barrel-chested, **bubbling with sticky density.** Two arms shaped more like clubs than fists, and a **faint juice steam** wafting off his shoulders like he's been waiting to hit something all week.

He flexes.

You nod.

&gt; &quot;Alright, bud. Keep up. Don't punch Tashigi.&quot;

He ripples in acknowledgment. Maybe a thumbs-up. Hard to tell. You'll count it.

---

**Tashigi signals.**

The two guards draw weapons.

And you, Kiwi Kop, and the team move in fast, **cutting down the slope in a practiced arc**, hugging the stone as you close in on the **broken depot door**.

You whisper.

&gt; &quot;Breaching on my mark...&quot;

---

**OOC: You now have the initiative. Surprise round unlocked. Enemy unaware. Two hostiles confirmed.**

Kiwi Kop will take one auto-assist action per round (distraction, body shield, pinning attack).

Would you like to:

1. {Lead the breach-kick in the door and go loud. Have Kiwi Kop rush center.}  
2. {Slip in through the broken window, flank left while Tashigi and guards breach the front.}  
3. {Use Kiwi Kop as a distraction-send him in first while you and the team cover exits.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Kiwi Kop can take hits. We fleshy humans can't. He takes point.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Surprise Breach, Round One]**  
**Scene: &quot;Kiwi Kop Kicks the Door&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Tactical | Mood: Controlled Chaos, Imminent Clash**

---

&gt; &quot;Kiwi Kop-*breach and distract.*&quot;

The elemental doesn't answer in words-just rumbles low in the pit of its citrus core and barrels forward with a **squelchy battle cry** that sounds like a blender hitting overdrive.

---

**WHAM!**

The depot's front door **explodes inward** with a wet **crack**, splinters flying as juice sprays against the entryway like a tropical crime scene. One of the guards lets out a stunned gasp.

**You charge right after.**

Tashigi's blade flashes in the sunlight, and both guards flank tight-**textbook triangle formation** behind your fruit-fueled battering ram.

---

**Inside:**

The depot's dim, musty interior is half-collapsed, the roof held up by old scaffolding and warped beams. Crates line the far wall, many pried open. An **inactive Den Den Mushi** sits on a box-its receiver glinting in the dusty light.

And the two occupants-**definitely Baroque Works remnants.**

- **Agent 1 (standing):** Tall, wiry, wrapped in desert layers. Wields a pair of **boomerang blades**, etched with the Baroque logo. Eyes widen just as Kiwi Kop crashes through.
- **Agent 2 (sitting):** Shorter, heavyset, **fumbling with what looks like a detonation talisman** or scroll. He scrambles backward, too slow.

---

**Surprise Round Triggered.**

**You act first. Choose one:**

1. {Order Kiwi Kop to pin the sitting one before he finishes arming the explosive. You handle the standing one.}  
2. {Focus on disabling the standing blade-wielder. Let Tashigi and guards handle the other.}  
3. {Juice spray the whole room. Control terrain. Let everyone move freely while enemies slip around.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Bomb! Secure it!

**Scene: &quot;Sticky Disarmament&quot;**

**Tone: Urgent | Mood: Controlled Chaos, Citrus Precision**

&gt; &quot;**Bomb! Secure it!**&quot; you bark, voice sharp, firm, commanding.

You thrust your arm forward-and **Kiwi Kop lurches into action** like a living tidal wave.

---

**Action: Kiwi Kop - Pinning Grapple Attempt on Seated Agent (Explosives Handler)**  
- Kiwi Grapple: (1d20+6) â **17 + 6 = 23**  
- Agent Resist: (1d20+3) â **11 + 3 = 14**  

**Result: SUCCESSFUL PIN.**

---

The citrus elemental **surges across the floor**, slapping its bulk down on the seated agent like a crashing tide. The enemy lets out a muffled *&quot;GGAHHRGH!&quot;* as he's smothered beneath a mountain of sticky pressure.

The **detonation scroll drops** from his hands and **clatters harmlessly** onto the floor, glimmering faintly with latent heat.

Kiwi Kop ripples, adjusting his bulk to press down harder-just enough to prevent any sudden movements.

&gt; &quot;Target restrained!&quot; one of the guards shouts, stepping in to flank and **retrieve the explosive** with tongs from his kit.

---

**Meanwhile...**

The **standing agent recovers** quickly, letting out a low growl. His twin boomerangs whip out in a V-shaped arc.

&gt; &quot;We were promised an escape. We *were told* the war was still ours!&quot;

**Combat Triggered: Agent 1 - Boomerang Attack at You (Disrupt the Commander)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+5) â **14 + 5 = 19**  
- Your AC (with field gear): 15  
- **HIT.**

---

One blade **ricochets off your shoulder**, slicing through the cloak and drawing a sharp **sting** across your bicep. Pain blooms-manageable, but it'll bruise deep.

&gt; &quot;Tch-Juice guy or not, I'll carve through all of you!&quot;

---

**Tashigi reacts.**

&gt; &quot;Not if I take your blades first.&quot;

**Tashigi Action - Disarming Counterstrike (Flash Draw)**  
- Attack Roll: (1d20+8) â **16 + 8 = 24**

- Special: DISARM check (Contested):  
   - Tashigi: (1d20+5) â 19  
   - Agent: (1d20+2) â 7  

**Result: CRIT MOMENT.**

---

Tashigi darts forward with a fluid **iaijutsu slice**, her blade catching the returning boomerang mid-arc and **slamming it into the floor** with a crunch of steel and sand.

The enemy stumbles, wide-eyed.

&gt; &quot;You-!&quot;

&gt; &quot;Ensign Tashigi,&quot; she snaps, stance perfect.  
&gt; &quot;Remember the name.&quot;

---

**Combat Summary - Round 1:**

- **You:** Lightly injured (shoulder), standing.  
- **Kiwi Kop:** Fully active, restraining Agent 2 (immobilized).  
- **Agent 1:** Disarmed (one weapon), staggered.  
- **Tashigi:** Full health, dominating melee.  
- **Guards:** Secured the detonation scroll. One guard covering exits.

---

**Next Move Options:**

1. {Spray Agent 1 with slippery juice-turn terrain against him, aid Tashigi's next strike.}  
2. {Close the distance and engage with your baton. Try to KO him.}  
3. {Order Kiwi Kop to shift pressure-maybe squeeze out information from Agent 2.}

**You drop your stance, baton in hand-fully extended now, the glint of Sea-Prism Stone catching a sliver of light through the dust-hazed roof.**

Your shoulder's throbbing where the boomerang caught you, but you push through it. That bastard aimed to maim, maybe kill. The kids you protect back home? This is what you keep them *away* from.

---

You step forward-no hesitation.

Tashigi locks eyes with you as you pass.

&gt; &quot;Take him.&quot;

&gt; &quot;With pleasure.&quot;

---

**ACTION: Close Combat (Baton Strike - Sea-Prism Tip, Target: Agent 1)**

   - Agent Roll: (1d20+1) â **5 + 1 = 6**  
   - **FAIL.**

---

**CRACK.**

The baton lands *square across his ribs*, sending a *sickening thump* through the depot. The Sea-Prism tip glows briefly as it connects-**nullifying energy**, scrambling nerves, breaking his stance.

The agent **gurgles**, drops his second boomerang, and **collapses to one knee**-stunned, windless.

---

One of the guards gasps.

&gt; &quot;Whoa. That was-was that Sea-Prism? Is he still breathing?&quot;

&gt; &quot;He's fine,&quot; you mutter.  
&gt; &quot;Just not going anywhere for a while.&quot;

---

**Kiwi Kop continues sitting merrily on the explosives guy**, who's now flailing uselessly with only a muffled groan escaping beneath pulpy pressure.

---

**Tashigi doesn't smile-but her voice drops an octave.**

&gt; &quot;Nice swing. Your form's improving.&quot;

You let out a half-chuckle.

&gt; &quot;All those beatings from you finally paid off.&quot;

---

**Combat Ends - Total Victory.**

- **Agent 1:** Unconscious, captured.  
- **Agent 2:** Restrained by Kiwi Kop.  
- **Explosives secured.**  
- **No casualties.**  
- **Tashigi:** Slightly impressed. Maybe a little more than slightly.

---

**Loot / Clues:**

- 1 Den Den Mushi (was active recently, still warm)  
- Open crates of **unmarked weapons** and **Baroque Works insignia** armor fragments  
- A folded map showing **tunnels leading east of Alubarna**, with multiple X marks along old **rebel staging camps**  
- A sealed envelope, waxed in **Crocodile's sigil** - unopened

---

Would you like to:

1. {Help restrain the agents for interrogation-maybe see what the envelope says.}  
2. {Check the map and report this to Smoker immediately. Potential sleeper cells.}  
3. {Open the envelope in private first. You're the one who bled for this.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOptio X: Crush the detonator. 

That should remove the threat of that crate of explosives in the corner.

The air is still buzzing from the clash-**the scent of scorched dust and citrus still heavy.** Kiwi Kop emits a gurgling purr as he maintains pressure on the squirming explosives handler, who is slowly realizing that oxygen, like ambition, is in short supply beneath a juice elemental.

You glance at the **scroll-sized detonator**, sitting on the nearby crate-its runes glowing faintly, trembling with unspent potential. Your eyes flick to the stack of **aged explosive crates** tucked along the wall, **Baroque Works sigils half-burned into the wood.**

Your fingers twitch toward your baton.

---

&gt; &quot;Nope,&quot; you mutter.  
&gt; &quot;We don't play with live fireworks in a wooden depot.&quot;

You **slam the Sea-Prism baton down** on the detonator scroll.

- (1d20+4) â 17 + 4 = **21**  
- Result: **SUCCESS**

---

The baton connects with a sharp **CRACK**, shattering the talisman into two curling, fizzling strips. A pulse of heated air ripples across the room, but the runes extinguish-**like a flame smothered by willpower and citrusy disdain.**

The nearby crates stop humming.

&gt; &quot;Well,&quot; one of the guards breathes out, &quot;I just unclenched muscles I forgot I had.&quot;

---

Tashigi nods in quiet approval, giving the crates a careful inspection.

&gt; &quot;No secondary trigger. Scroll was the main conduit. Nicely done.&quot;

You give a mock bow.

&gt; &quot;Preventing sudden combustion: just part of the job now, ma'am.&quot;

---

The depot falls into that **strangely sacred post-battle silence**, broken only by the faint squeaks of the Den Den Mushi still sitting on the crate. It's not transmitting anymore, but it **was active.**

And that envelope-still sealed, still untouched-rests quietly in the shadow of the weapons rack.

---

**Kiwi Kop slowly raises one syrupy arm, giving you a thumbs-up. Probably.**  
You're not sure what that gesture means in his species.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Open the envelope and read what Baroque left behind.}  
2. {Pass the envelope to Tashigi, letting her handle it as ranking officer.}  
3. {Secure the site and call in reinforcements. You've cleared the quarry, but there may be more out there.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 2 - Observe the detonator that I squashed

OOC: I will discover something soon from the detonator. (I'll reveal later)

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Moments After the Bang That Never Was]**  
**Scene: &quot;Trembling Threads&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Suspicious | Mood: Slow-Build Realization, Controlled Curiosity**

---

You crouch over the remains of the detonator scroll, baton still humming faintly from the impact.

At first, it's just **charred parchment**, still smoldering faintly at the edges. Standard **Baroque-issue explosive rune work**-you'd seen similar schematics during a post-battle briefing from a palace engineer.

But there's something... **off.**

---

You squint.

The inner layer of the scroll-curled like a burnt cinnamon roll-has **an additional inscription** underneath the primary trigger runes. Hidden by the top parchment. Smaller. Carved **not with ink**, but **pressed indentations**, nearly invisible unless you were up close.

You trace your fingers gently along the grooves.

It's **not a second explosive command.**

It's...

&gt; *&quot;D.E. - 402. NW of Alubarna. Burn after use. He suspects.&quot;*

Your brow furrows.

D.E.?

---

You glance up as **Tashigi takes the sealed envelope**, her expression unreadable as she slips it into a protected pouch on her belt.

&gt; &quot;Chain of evidence. Smoker should see it first,&quot; she mutters.

You nod slowly-but your focus is still on the **new inscription.**

You mutter under your breath:

&gt; &quot;Not just a bomb. This was a *message.* Hidden beneath the trigger.&quot;

---

And the timing...

The scroll was still active.

Which meant **whoever was listening... might've been waiting for a signal.**

Or worse-

They might've **heard everything up to the moment you crushed it.**

---

**OOC: You've uncovered a covert coordination network. &quot;D.E.&quot; is a code. Possibly a person. Possibly a site. Possibly a trap.**  
You have a lead: **&quot;402 - NW of Alubarna.&quot;** Perhaps a rendezvous point, bunker, or fallback zone.

**Clue quietly logged.** Only you noticed the hidden message.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Keep this information private for now-too soon to trust anyone fully.}  
2. {Tell Tashigi discreetly when the guards aren't listening.}  
3. {Tell Smoker directly once you return to the palace. Let him decide.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption X - This isn't a detonator... It looks more like a timer...

I glance over at the 'quiet' crate of explosives in the corner, where Tashigi is pulling a bundle of folders off a shelf.

OOC - Pause 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Sandstone Depot - Time Bomb]**  
**Scene: &quot;The Clock You Didn't Hear Ticking&quot;**  
**POV: You**  
**Tone: Sudden Dread | Mood: Rising Tension, Snap Realization**

---

You freeze.

Your gaze slowly turns from the cracked scroll beneath your hand...  
...to the **row of crates** in the far corner.

The ones with the **Baroque sigils** half-sanded away.  
The ones you'd assumed were inert.  
The ones Tashigi now stands beside-one boot casually planted on a reinforced lid, pulling down a bundle of weather-worn folders from a high shelf.

---

And then the gears in your mind begin to **click.**

**It wasn't a remote detonator.**  
**It was a delay fuse. A countdown.**

A *start* trigger.

---

The scroll you crushed...  
*Didn't deactivate anything.*  
It **started something.**

You catch a faint sound-**not a hum**, not magic-but the **deep, mechanical *ticking*** you'd missed beneath the citrus stink and adrenaline.

The **crates are hot again.**  
Too hot.

---

&gt; &quot;Tashigi-&quot;

Your voice is tight, rough, forced through a throat suddenly too small.

&gt; &quot;Tashigi, MOVE.&quot;

---

**OOC: PAUSED.**  
(When ready, we will continue with a timed threat event: ticking time bomb. Lives on the line.  
React quickly. Narrate or act. Every moment counts.)

&gt;&gt; USER: In one movement, pure instinct, I run over and wrap my arms around Tashigi's waist, then spin her around, facing away from the crate. I will Kiwi Kop to get behind me and attempt to smother the crate. Before I can offer an explanation to her flustered/embarrassd squawk, or push her away, the drowned crate detonates.

Not as catastrophically as it could've been (otherwise we'd all have become sketchy kebab meat), but it's still big. Heavy injuries expected.

The shockwave slams into me from behind.

The **moment stretches.**

A heartbeat becomes an **eternity**.

Your feet are already moving before your mind finishes the thought.

&gt; *Tashigi's too close.*  
&gt; *There's no time to yell.*  
&gt; *There's only time to act.*

---

**You're at her side in one breath.**

Your arms lock around her waist-**not with finesse, but with ferocity.**

She lets out a startled, indignant gasp:

&gt; &quot;Wh-!?&quot;

But there's no time.

You **pivot**, slam your boots into the dirt, and **twist her away from the crate** just as a tremor runs through the floorboards like the bones of a dying beast.

---

&gt; &quot;Kiwi Kop! *NOW!*&quot;

The elemental answers with a **guttural roar**, flinging itself over the nearest crate like a sloshing shield wall-its limbs stretching into **a great dome of syrupy resistance**.

Too little time.  
Too much explosive.

---

**BOOM.**

The **crate erupts.**

A flood of sand, shrapnel, and smoke **slams into your back like a giant's hammer.**  
**Kiwi Kop absorbs the brunt of it**-but even his saturated body **ripples and shatters**, shards of juice flinging outward like flecks of acid rain.

**You bear the rest.**

---

**CONSEQUENCES:**

- Shockwave Damage: (2d10+5) â **9 + 7 + 5 = 21**  
- Mitigation from Kiwi Kop: **-8**  
- Mitigation from Gear: **-3**  
- Final Impact: **10 HP direct trauma + blast concussion**

**Result: Brutally injured. Cracked ribs. Burned shoulder. Temporarily deaf in one ear.**

---

You hit the ground hard, **Tashigi tumbling on top of you**, shielded from the brunt of the explosion. Her arms scramble around you the moment the world stops spinning.

&gt; &quot;EATONE?!&quot;

Her voice is muffled-**everything's muffled.** Like you're underwater, brain still vibrating inside your skull.

---

Your cloak is half burned.

Your badge is dented.

Your back feels like it's trying to **separate from your spine**.

And still-

You're breathing.

She is, too.

---

The guards scramble. One's yelling. The other's coughing through smoke.

You see a **giant streak of emerald juice** slowly pooling under what's left of Kiwi Kop-splattered against the far wall, **broken but loyal to the last drop.**

---

Tashigi's face hovers over yours-smeared with ash, eyes blazing.

&gt; &quot;Why would you-? What the hell were you thinking?!&quot;

Your hearing's still not fully back.

Your heartbeat's too loud.

But you manage a rasp.

&gt; &quot;Instinct.&quot;

Then a faint smile.

&gt; &quot;...Tactical morale reset.&quot;

---

**OOC: You're alive. Kiwi Kop is out of commission. Tashigi is safe.**

But something *more sinister* is now confirmed:

**Baroque Works left sleeper explosives wired to *timed detonation orders*, not remote signals. Meaning others may be active elsewhere.**

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Wave off help, try to stand. Let her yell while you focus on the mission.}  
2. {Let her yell. You're not getting up anytime soon. Take the scolding. You earned it.}  
3. {Ask someone to check the map. &quot;402 NW of Alubarna.&quot; You have a sinking feeling.}

---

You lie on the floor like a man who just got used as a **fruit-based meat shield**, because, well... **you were.**

Your back screams.

Your legs don't want to work.

Your ears are ringing.

Your ribs feel like they're holding a personal grudge.

And for a flicker of a second-just a second-you swear you can still hear **Snack Pack's battle cry** in the recesses of your memory.

---

&gt; &quot;Uuugh... not again...&quot; you mutter with a dry wheeze.  
&gt; &quot;Feels like Mr. 4's stupid cannonballs all over again.&quot;

You **groan**-not out of pain this time, but out of sheer exhausted *offense.*

---

You **tilt your head** weakly toward Tashigi, eyes scanning her.

She's ash-dusted, her coat torn along one shoulder, and her hair's half-fallen from its clip. But she's upright. Breathing. Not bleeding. And most importantly-

**Still whole.**

---

Her hands are on you-**checking your pulse**, fumbling for wounds-her movements jerky, wild with adrenaline. Then she sees your eyes locked on hers.

&gt; &quot;You-You absolute *idiot.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;Valid.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You threw yourself on me like some *dramatized ballad hero!* Do you think that makes you noble?! That could've-You almost-!&quot;

Her hands clench into fists on your collar. Her jaw trembles.

But her eyes don't leave yours.

&gt; &quot;You didn't have to.&quot;

You manage a pained smile.

&gt; &quot;Actually... I kinda did.&quot;

---

She stares a beat longer.

Then-

**gently**-lets your collar go.

And stays right beside you, knees in the dirt, her blade laid across her lap like an extension of her body.

---

**Behind her, the guards are shouting for a medic.**  
Someone's dragging the remaining agent up from where Kiwi Kop pinned him.  
The other starts poking the blackened crates cautiously with the **blunt end of his spear**.

---

&gt; &quot;Check every seal,&quot; Tashigi calls without turning.  
&gt; &quot;These weren't mines. They were *warnings.*&quot;

Then to you, softer:

&gt; &quot;You see a bomb again, pineapple? **Shout first.** Dramatically throw yourself into harm *second.*&quot;

You groan again.

&gt; &quot;Noted.&quot;

---

**OOC: Severe wound sustained. You're currently in the &quot;crippled&quot; state-limited combat ability until healed.**

**Tashigi: unharmed physically. Emotionally? Rattled. Deepened bond. Respect laced with anger and fear for your safety.**

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask to be carried back to town with full dramatic flair. Make it awkward.}  
2. {Insist on staying for the evidence sweep. Let Tashigi scold you more while you lie there.}  
3. {Mention the &quot;402 NW&quot; code quietly, while you're down-let her investigate it further.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Ohhhhhhh I'm going to need more of that palace healthcare again. I hope they don't bill me this time.

---

You lie there like a man who just went five rounds with a sandstorm and lost a fight to a crate.

With a **raspy wheeze**, you raise one shaky arm toward the sky like a tragic theater actor, your other hand resting over your ribs like you're auditioning for a particularly *dramatic* play called *&quot;Oh No, My Spine.&quot;*

&gt; &quot;Oooooohhhh... I'm gonna need more of that **palace healthcare** again. And this time... I really hope they don't bill me.&quot;

Tashigi exhales hard, fighting the smirk trying to tug at the corner of her mouth.

---

She crouches back down, her gloved hand gently nudging your cheek to keep your head elevated while one of the guards approaches with a **folding stretcher**.

&gt; &quot;You're a mess.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Correction: I am a *heroic* mess.&quot;

You look up at her with all the composure of someone who just got thrown by the plot-and *landed in friendship*.

---

&gt; &quot;And don't even try to tell me I shouldn't have shielded you.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;You could've *died*, Tashigi.&quot;

She opens her mouth.

Closes it again.

---

A flicker of frustration crosses her face-but it's not **anger**.  
Not really.

It's guilt. It's fear.  
And maybe-just maybe-it's something even heavier.

&gt; &quot;And if *you* died, then what, huh?&quot; she mutters.  
&gt; &quot;Do you know what that would've done to Vivi? To me?&quot;

Your grin falters just slightly.

Then you speak, quieter this time.

&gt; &quot;But you *didn't* die.&quot;

&gt; &quot;You lived. That's... all I needed to make peace with it.&quot;

---

The guard snorts as he finishes unfolding the stretcher.

&gt; &quot;You two want me to give you a minute, or should I go build you a chapel?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Shut it,&quot; Tashigi and you say at the same time.

---

**OOC: Palace medical wing is on standby.**  
You'll be evacuated, placed under observation, and restricted from combat for the next few days.

---

As Tashigi kneels beside the stretcher and guides your battered body onto it, her touch is *surprisingly gentle*. She doesn't look away once. Doesn't hide the way her brow furrows, or how her lips twitch when you wince.

She mutters under her breath, barely audible.

&gt; &quot;Next time, we go down together.&quot;

---

Would you like to:

1. {Reply seriously-tell her that's not an option. Someone always has to live.}  
2. {Reply with humor-&quot;If you want a joint grave, at least let me pick the headstone.&quot;}  
3. {Stay quiet. Just give her hand a squeeze while you're carried away.}

&gt;&gt; USER: âOption 1 - Fuck no. If I can save a life, I'm saving a life. If I can your life, I'm definitely saving your life.

---

The stretcher creaks beneath you, carried carefully by one guard in front and another at the rear. **The desert wind has shifted cooler**, evening clouds rolling in to cast **dappled shadows** across the sand-blasted trail leading back to the capital.

Tashigi walks beside you, quiet, hands folded behind her back like a cadet on silent duty. Her expression is fixed forward-guarded. But you can feel the tension **in her shoulders**, the way her steps slow each time she looks at you out of the corner of her eye.

She thinks she's hiding it.

She's not.

---

&gt; &quot;Next time,&quot; she'd said.  
&gt; &quot;We go down together.&quot;

---

You grunt, managing to raise a **shaking hand**, drawing the smallest bit of kiwi juice to your palm.

It's golden, sticky-sweet this time-**your subconscious desire to comfort reflected in its flavor.** You gently smear it over a **nasty patch of burn** at your side, hissing under your breath as the cool salve begins to **ease the pain** and slow the bubbling soreness.

Then you turn your head toward her. Voice hoarse, but **unyielding**.

&gt; &quot;Fuck no.&quot;

She blinks, taken aback.

You push through the pain, lock eyes with her.

&gt; &quot;If I can save a life, I'm saving a life. *Any* life.&quot;

&gt; &quot;If I can save *your* life?&quot;

You breathe out slowly. A bit of blood catches on your lower lip, but you wipe it off with the back of your sleeve.

&gt; &quot;Then I'm *definitely* saving your life.&quot;

---

The guards exchange a glance but wisely say nothing.

Tashigi slows in her step, staring at you now-fully, openly. Like she doesn't know whether to yell at you, slap you, or sit down beside you and never leave again.

---

Finally, she mutters, voice low, nearly swallowed by the wind:

&gt; &quot;...you really are the most irresponsible responsible adult I've ever met.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I contain multitudes,&quot; you rasp.

She shakes her head. Then-slowly-reaches out and **places one gloved hand lightly over yours**, careful of the juice but still... grounded. Present.

She doesn't let go the rest of the walk back.

---

**OOC: Scene concluded.**  
You are returned to the palace under immediate care.  
Your wounds are now considered **healing**, but you remain **combat-ineffective** for 2 in-game days.

**Rumors beat you to the palace.**

By the time the guards rush to receive you, a **buzz has rippled through the city's recovery crews** and soldiers.

Whispers abound.

&gt; &quot;He's the one who summoned the elemental...&quot;  
&gt; &quot;They say he shielded Ensign Tashigi from a bomb-didn't make it.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;I heard he went out like a knight. Didn't even scream.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;What was his name again? Kii-something?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Snackpack-sensei?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;No, *Pineapple-sama.*&quot;  
&gt; &quot;...Didn't he work at a school?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;A *what?!*&quot;

---

You catch fragments of the crowd, voices blending together like a surreal eulogy.

A Marine lieutenant starts saluting when he sees the stretcher.

A few palace medics **pause with visible surprise** when they realize you're-somehow-**still breathing.**

---

&gt; &quot;Wait-he's alive?&quot;  
&gt; &quot;That's him? He's not... juiced?&quot;

One medic fumbles with a clipboard. Another drops his flask.

&gt; &quot;He's even making *jokes.*&quot;

---

Tashigi walks beside the stretcher like a quiet specter, her hand still loosely resting on the frame. She says nothing to the gathering crowd, **eyes forward, jaw tight.**

But the **rumor tide doesn't stop.**

Not even as the medics lift you inside.

Not even as the infirmary doors swing shut behind you.

---

**Inside the medical wing**, Vivi paces frantically beside your assigned bed, having just been briefed. Her eyes go wide as they wheel you in, and she bolts to your side.

&gt; &quot;You're not dead!!&quot;

&gt; &quot;Was hoping to keep that part a surprise,&quot; you croak.  
&gt; &quot;Didn't want to spoil the ending.&quot;

---

She leans down, brushing her fingers through your hair-not scolding, not teasing-just relief, raw and unfiltered.

Tashigi speaks quietly behind her.

&gt; &quot;He shielded me. Took the worst of it.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Again?&quot; Vivi mutters, brows knitting.  
&gt; &quot;He's going to keep doing this, isn't he?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Unfortunately... yes,&quot; Tashigi replies, her voice almost fond. Almost.

---

**OOC: The palace believes you nearly died.**

The bed creaks softly as you're lowered in by the medics, who murmur about bandages, salves, and trauma compression wraps. Your coat, half-burnt and citrus-splotched, is folded with mild reverence and placed aside like some kind of national artifact.

Meanwhile, **Tashigi stands guard like a silent sword at your bedside**, and **Vivi hasn't stopped gripping your forearm** since you were wheeled in. Her hand trembles, but she hasn't noticed-or maybe she has, and she just doesn't care.

You open one eye halfway. Enough to meet both of theirs.

Then, voice raspy but dry as the Alabastan wind, you croak:

&gt; &quot;You ladies really need to stop standing in front of explosives...&quot;

A beat.

&gt; &quot;It's become a *very* bad habit.&quot;

---

**Tashigi stiffens.**

**Vivi gasps.**

And then-

&gt; &quot;*YOU JERK!*&quot; Vivi yells, her voice cracking.

She swats at your shoulder before remembering you're bandaged like a fruit-themed mummy.

&gt; &quot;I thought you *died!* Do you know what I heard?! That you *exploded*! That there was nothing left but a puddle and a smile!&quot;

&gt; &quot;I heard you got vaporized trying to protect me,&quot; Tashigi adds with unamused flatness.  
&gt; &quot;Or melted into a permanent juice puddle and slid into the sewer.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...Well, that last one's not completely off,&quot; you mumble.

---

Vivi wipes at her eyes angrily, cheeks pink.

&gt; &quot;There were *poets* outside the gates reciting lines about the fallen Kiwi Knight.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I nearly kicked one,&quot; Tashigi says with a shrug.

---

You grin, wincing through the movement.

&gt; &quot;Good. Let âem write it all down. But make sure they spell my name right on the statue.&quot;

The garden courtyard of Alubarna-once a sanctuary of soft color and perfumed stillness-has become a place of uneasy whispers and **haunted footfalls**. The bougainvillea hang limp. The fountains murmur like mourners.

And Vivi stands there, **alone at first**, her arms wrapped tightly around her middle as the sky swells toward late afternoon.

The reports had started pouring in barely an hour ago.

&gt; &quot;Explosive detonation. Sandstone depot.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Two Marine operatives-one possibly injured. One unaccounted for.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;The bounty hunter. The... Kiwi man. He was shielding her.&quot;

Vivi had **demanded names**, specifics. She got none.

Just fragments.

Just enough to **build a funeral from imagination.**

---

She paces.

Her slippers scuff gently across the red stone tiles as nobles and guards filter in and out around her, giving her space-but not silence. Never silence.

&gt; &quot;They say he shielded her with his body. Just threw himself over the crate.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;He conjured that juice creature again, but it wasn't enough.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;Left nothing but his baton.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;The Marine girl-barely conscious-was carried out by survivors.&quot;  
&gt; &quot;He stayed. Went down with the depot.&quot;

Someone left a **pouch of kiwis** on a nearby bench. Out of respect.

She hasn't touched them.

---

**Tashigi hasn't returned.**  
**You haven't returned.**  
**Only the smoke from the depot had risen.**

---

A messenger boy-barely older than her younger self, really-had tried to cheer her up with an optimistic report:

&gt; &quot;My uncle's a sand-runner. He said he saw someone crawling through the dunes earlier-looked juiced up and muttering about taxes. Maybe it was him!&quot;

She had smiled at that.

A weak, **paper-thin smile**, meant only to keep the boy from crumbling with her.

---

Then she had turned away, stepped behind one of the date palms, and **cried so quietly even the leaves didn't hear her.**

---

&gt; *&quot;I should have stood closer.&quot;*  
&gt; *&quot;I should have seen it.&quot;*  
&gt; *&quot;I should've been the one-&quot;*

Her hands clenched so hard they left **crescent marks on her palms.**

Vivi, the princess. The survivor of Baroque Works. The infiltrator. The peacemaker. The symbol of the country reborn.

But **not even all that armor could stop the ache.**

---

And then-

Not long after the sun shifted angles in the sky-

The distant **gate guards shouted.**

The palace bell rang, not for attack or ceremony-

-but for **return.**

---

A stretcher.

Two guards.

One broken, sarcastic, juice-covered man giving finger-guns to the confused crowd.

And Tashigi walking beside him, face unreadable, grip white-knuckled on the rail.

---

Vivi had **run.**

No decorum.

No royal poise.

She'd **shoved two ministers aside** in the marble corridor, **scattered scrolls and shock** across the throne wing, and nearly **tripped on her own skirt rounding the infirmary hall.**

---

By the time she saw you, conscious, sarcastic, oozing in more ways than one-

She had to resist the urge to slap you **and cry into your shoulder at the same time.**

---

**[Flash Forward - Present, Infirmary Room]**

She holds your hand now.

You mutter between shallow breaths:

&gt; &quot;I could really use something to eat. Fill up the big ol' hole in my back that bomb made.&quot;

She blinks, startled-like she'd forgotten you could still make jokes.

And then she laughs, softly.

&gt; &quot;You're ridiculous.&quot;

She steps away, just long enough to bark at a startled aide:

&gt; &quot;Get this man *food.* Preferably something **not** juice-based.&quot;

---

**OOC: Vivi's bond with you is now unshakeable.**  
She saw your death.  
She felt the grief.  
And she got you back.

And not even the World Government could take that from her now.

---

Would you like to continue the scene with Vivi and Tashigi, or rest quietly until food arrives?

&gt;&gt; USER: I sure this doesn't result in any chronic back pain. Hey, Tashigi-chan, your back feeling alright?

I talk airily, as if I weren't wrapped up in bandages like a moth's cocoon.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Infirmary Suite, Moments Later]**  
**Scene: &quot;Back Talk and Battle Scars&quot;**  
**POV: You (Cocooned), Tashigi (Flat-Stared), Vivi (Trying Not to Laugh)**  
**Tone: Lighthearted | Mood: Post-Crisis Whiplash, Found-Family Vibes**

---

Your voice floats lazily through the infirmary chamber, as if you weren't currently **swaddled tighter than a noblewoman's firstborn** in layers of antiseptic wraps, herbal poultices, and warm compresses.

&gt; &quot;I *sure* hope this doesn't result in any chronic back pain...&quot;

You sigh dramatically, shifting about half an inch before groaning at the betrayal of your ribs.

&gt; &quot;Hey, Tashigi-chan-*your* back feeling alright?&quot;

---

There's a pause.

You hear a choked sound from the right.

**Vivi is stifling a laugh**, her hand covering her mouth, trying to appear respectful. She's failing spectacularly.

Tashigi, however-

She stands just to your left, arms crossed.

And gives you the kind of look that **could've bent steel.**

---

&gt; &quot;Mine's fine,&quot; she says flatly, &quot;unlike someone who used it like a sandbag filled with fruit pulp.&quot;

You grin up at her. You can't see her, not from this angle, but you can feel her *glower* rolling over your cocooned form like a thundercloud with glasses.

&gt; &quot;You're welcome,&quot; you chirp.

---

&gt; &quot;You're incorrigible,&quot; she replies, stepping over and pressing a fresh, blessedly cold towel to your neck.

&gt; &quot;And you're terrible at accepting help.&quot;

&gt; &quot;I'm great at accepting breakfast,&quot; you counter.

---

Vivi raises an eyebrow.

&gt; &quot;You're also apparently good at accepting near-death experiences. That's what-third time?&quot;

&gt; &quot;Two and a half,&quot; you mumble. &quot;I wasn't technically dead after the gator cannonball. Just *really inconvenienced.*&quot;

---

A palace aide finally arrives with a silver tray laden with **warm honey bread, a small side of grilled spiced fish, dates, cheese**, and to your surprise-

&gt; &quot;No kiwis?&quot; you ask.

The aide blinks.

&gt; &quot;...The princess gave *strict* orders.&quot;

Vivi crosses her arms and nods proudly.

&gt; &quot;I banned them from your diet. Medical reasons.&quot;

---

**OOC: You've earned full recovery within 48 in-game hours.**

During this time, you can:

- Continue deepening relationships with key NPCs (Vivi, Tashigi, palace staff, Smoker)  
- Prepare for next steps (investigating Baroque remnants, the &quot;402 NW&quot; lead)  
- Explore the palace and interact with the increasingly colorful rumors around you  
- Or just... be a weird local hero with chronic back pain and a sense of civic duty.

---

Would you like to:

1. {Ask about any word from Smoker or Marine HQ. What's the response to the depot bombing?}  
2. {Ask Vivi and Tashigi what they'll do once things quiet down.}  
3. {Focus on eating. &quot;Hero work's hungry work.&quot; Let them talk while you snack.}

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 3 - Enjoy the bread.

OOC - A long, detailed scene of Vivi and Tashigi contemplating recent events. When they were still fighting Crocodile, every disaster seemed normal. Manageable. But now that peace is returning, something like this... Stings. And the possibility of Eatone's death 

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Adjacent Courtyard, Evening]**  
**Scene: &quot;Aftermath Echoes&quot;**  
**POV: Vivi &amp; Tashigi**  
**Tone: Reflective | Mood: Uneasy Calm, Emotional Vulnerability**  
**Setting: The sun is falling behind Alubarna's western domes, casting long golden streaks through vine-draped colonnades. A low wind carries the scent of cactus blossoms and scorched masonry dust. The city breathes-but doesn't quite exhale. Not yet.**

---

**The infirmary grows quiet**, your slow, steady chewing the only sound behind the thin curtains.

Warm bread. Honey drizzle. A faint sigh of satisfaction.  
**Eatone Cheng is, for now, safe.**

But outside the curtained ward, under the open arch of a crumbling terrace where vines curl around burned sandstone columns-two women stand in thoughtful silence.

**Vivi, in her modest desert-blue dress, arms crossed. Tashigi, in partial Marine uniform, her sword hanging loose at her side.**

They've fought warlords.

They've faced assassination squads.

They've stood at the cliff's edge of **a nation's collapse.**

And yet-

---

&gt; &quot;This felt... different,&quot; Vivi finally says.

Her voice is soft. Not weak, but restrained-like a harpstring drawn too tight.

Tashigi doesn't answer right away. Her eyes are fixed on the **pool of moonlight gathering beneath a statue**-the one of Queen Nefertari Lili. A symbol of long-lost courage and ancient burdens.

&gt; &quot;It was smaller,&quot; Tashigi says at last. &quot;Quieter. Just a crate. Just two agents.&quot;

&gt; &quot;But if he hadn't been there...&quot;

&gt; &quot;I would have died.&quot;

Vivi flinches at how plainly Tashigi says it. There's no bravado. No denial. No elaborate rationalization.

Just *truth*.

---

&gt; &quot;I thought he was dead,&quot; Vivi whispers. &quot;I believed it. I *felt* it. Like someone had taken something-no. Someone. Someone I hadn't even realized I'd come to count on.&quot;

Her arms tighten around herself.

&gt; &quot;It's strange. When we were still fighting Crocodile, everything was chaos. The idea of someone dying felt... remote. I knew it was possible, but I *couldn't focus* on it. There was always another battle, another plot.&quot;

She swallows hard, blinking into the fading light.

&gt; &quot;But now that it's quiet... now that we've won...&quot;

&gt; &quot;Every threat feels louder,&quot; Tashigi finishes. &quot;Sharper.&quot;

---

They stand a moment in silence, letting the breeze roll over them, brushing away heat and grief that refuses to fully settle.

&gt; &quot;You ever think about how he's not like us?&quot; Vivi asks suddenly.

&gt; &quot;You mean *not legally allowed to hold a sword?*&quot; Tashigi replies dryly.

Vivi gives a soft huff of a laugh, but shakes her head.

&gt; &quot;I mean he's not royalty. Not military. He's not even really a bounty hunter. He's just... a man. A teacher. Who got caught up in something that should never have touched his life.&quot;

---

Tashigi closes her eyes. She remembers the feel of his grip on her waist right before the blast. The heat. The ring in her ears. The sickening moment where she was sure he was gone.

&gt; &quot;He doesn't act like a soldier,&quot; she murmurs. &quot;But he fights like someone who's trying to protect something he doesn't think he deserves to hold.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Or someone,&quot; Vivi whispers.

---

Another long silence.

Then Vivi turns, slowly, her voice lower now.

&gt; &quot;I'm glad he didn't die.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...Me too.&quot;

---

From behind the curtain, your voice drifts sleepily:

&gt; &quot;Did I hear my name? Or is this just the honey bread talking...?&quot;

---

Tashigi rolls her eyes with a sigh.

Vivi smiles, warmth returning like morning sun over the ruins.

&gt; &quot;It's definitely the bread.&quot;

---

**OOC: Bond Event Unlocked - &quot;Quiet Moments After the Storm&quot;**  
- **Vivi:** Connection solidified. Emotional reliance deepening.  
- **Tashigi:** Trust hardened through crisis. Protective instincts have crystallized.  
- Their relationship with each other has also deepened-tied together by shared battle, mutual loss, and the man they nearly lost.

---

Would you like to continue from the infirmary the next morning, or explore a brief night scene first-perhaps dreams, or quiet conversations with either woman?

&gt;&gt; USER: Night Scene. I am peaceful asleep. Still looking like a burnt cocoon.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Infirmary, Deep Nightfall]**  
**Scene: &quot;Burnt Cocoon, Beating Heart&quot;**  
**POV: External - Observing Eatone at Rest**  
**Tone: Quiet | Mood: Tender, Reflective, Healing**

---

The moonlight streams through the **arched window**, casting soft silvers across the stone floor, where once only dust and firelight danced.

You lie still in your bed, your form wrapped in **so many bandages** you resemble some vaguely tropical-themed sarcophagus. Your hair is matted against the pillow, a patch of dried juice clinging to the corner of your jaw.

Your chest rises and falls in a steady rhythm-**a survivor's breath**, deeper than it was when they first brought you in.

No twitching.

No groaning.

Just peace.

---

You don't hear the **soft footfalls** that cross the room, sandal against stone, nor the **swish of a Marine coat** folding neatly onto a chair. You don't feel the **presence at your bedside** settle in with a sigh.

But she's there.

---

**Tashigi sits in the chair beside you**, legs crossed, her sword propped nearby but **not within immediate reach**-a rare vulnerability from a woman who sleeps with a hand on the hilt.

She watches you in silence.

The bandages on your face make you look **younger**, somehow. A little ridiculous. A little tragic. A lot brave.

&gt; &quot;Still looks like he's going to mutter something about paperwork,&quot; she murmurs, half to herself.

She pulls a small cloth from her sleeve and gently, without waking you, **dabs a bit of dried juice from your cheek.**

---

In the stillness, **Vivi arrives not long after**, dressed in a pale robe, hair down over her shoulders. She pauses when she sees Tashigi already seated.

There's a flicker of **mutual embarrassment**, and then-understanding.

No words.

She walks over and takes the other chair.

---

For a while, neither of them speak.

They simply sit-one princess, one soldier-listening to the quiet, feeling the **absence of bombs, blades, and barking orders.**

Feeling the **presence** of someone who should've died, and didn't.

---

After a long moment, Tashigi speaks, her voice soft:

&gt; &quot;He said I wasn't allowed to die. That he'd save me, every time.&quot;

Vivi looks at you, then at Tashigi.

&gt; &quot;And yet he keeps almost dying *himself.*&quot;

&gt; &quot;Selfish idiot.&quot;

&gt; &quot;Big-hearted idiot.&quot;

&gt; &quot;...Yeah.&quot;

---

They fall silent again.

The night deepens.

Your breathing never falters.

---

Eventually, **Tashigi's head leans sideways**, resting lightly against the bed frame.

**Vivi leans forward**, folding her arms beside your pillow, forehead resting atop them, close enough to feel your warmth.

---

And so the cocooned man sleeps...

Surrounded by the two lives he saved.

And guarded, in silence, by those who now silently vow to protect *him.*

---

**OOC: Scene End.**  
Would you like to begin the next day with morning recovery-or a soft wake-up with visitors still nearby?

&gt;&gt; USER: Option 1 - dream of warmth. Also wake up feeling unusual sources of nearby warmth.

&gt;&gt; ASSISTANT: **[Royal Palace - Infirmary, Dawnlight Filtering In]**  
**Scene: &quot;Shared Heat&quot;**  
**POV: You (Dreamer, Slowly Waking)**  
**Tone: Gentle | Mood: Vulnerable, Soft, Faintly Embarrassing**

---

You drift, somewhere between sleep and sensation.

**No fire. No pain. No explosions.**

Just... **warmth.**

A soft cocoon of it, not just from the bandages, but *around* you. A memory of comfort-like an old classroom blanket, or a late afternoon sunbeam catching you asleep on a teacher's lounge chair. There's citrus in it, yes, but it's mellow now. Reassuring. Homey.

And other things:

**The weight of silk. The faint scent of perfume. Leather, metal polish, and wildflowers.**

And then-movement.

Something shifts beside your pillow.

Another presence shifts near your arm.

**Both warm. Both real.**

---

Your eyelids peel open slowly, blinking against the morning haze. The light isn't blinding-it's **soft**, filtered through gauze curtains fluttering gently in the dawn breeze.

You don't remember falling asleep this peacefully.

And yet... you haven't woken alone.

---

To your immediate left, resting with uncharacteristic vulnerability, **Tashigi's head lies slumped near your shoulder**, tucked just against the crook of your arm. One of her hands is gently curled against her jacket, her **glasses slightly askew**, hair uncharacteristically down and **resting against your bicep.**

To your right, curled halfway on the bed, her arms folded gently atop the edge of the mattress, **Vivi breathes slowly**, her cheek pressed against her forearm, hair like a curtain across her eyes. She murmurs something unintelligible in her sleep-a twitch of a smile crossing her face.

---

You freeze.

The heat from both sides is unmistakable.  
So is the way they're **unconsciously leaning in**-seeking warmth. Or something more.

And you... are **the warmth.**

---

&gt; &quot;...Okay,&quot; you whisper hoarsely to no one.  
&gt; &quot;Definitely not dead. This is way too cozy for hell.&quot;

Your ribs groan a little when you shift.

Neither of them stirs.

---

For one perfect moment, you're **held in place not by wounds-but by affection**.

And despite the aching, the scars, the months of blood and sweat and citrus...

**You don't move.**

You just lie there.

And let yourself be cared for.

---

**Would you like to:**

1. {Stay still and quietly enjoy it. Let them wake naturally.}  
2. {Try to slowly, delicately sit up... and likely disturb both.}  
3. {Say something. A joke. A whisper. Something to mark this moment.}</pre>
